[{"review_text": "\n         My dinner date had eaten in this room before. A Williams College graduate, she remembered its earlier incarnation as the school\u2019s alumni club.\n        \n\n         \u201cI practically lived here at one point,\u201d she said, looking over her shoulder at the stuffed peacock stashed in one corner. \u201cI took almost all my meals here.\u201d\n        \n\n         How was the food?\n        \n\n\n\n\n          \u201cGhastly.\u201d\n         \n\n\n         By the end of the night, she announced it is much better now. For that, she can thank her fellow alumni for selling the building on East 39th Street to a developer who turned it into a boutique hotel. Called\n         \n          the William\n         \n         , it opened before Christmas with two upholstered cocktail lounges and two distinct places to eat reformed English cooking. We were upstairs in\n         \n          the Peacock\n         \n         , a civilized, grown-up restaurant where\n         \n\n\n          Ray Charles\n         \n         shimmies from the speakers and the wine list is refreshingly nondenominational. One floor below, in the English basement (what other kind would an English restaurant use?) is\n         \n          the Shakespeare\n         \n         , a rustic pub with a rock soundtrack, soccer on both televisions and taps for British lagers and cask ales.\n        \n\n         The two spots share a kitchen, a chef named Robert Aikens and just enough dishes to justify corralling them into a single review. The food I ate during two dinners at the Peacock and one at the\n         \n\n\n          Shakespeare\n         \n         was always appealing; the settings were somewhat less so.\n        \n\n         This was particularly true in the Shakespeare, where in the early evening packs of beer drinkers can crowd out those of us who are there to find out if the shepherd\u2019s pie made by Mr. Aikens is better than the mound of ruined groceries that went by the same name in our mothers\u2019 kitchens.\n        \n\n         It is, by leaps and bounds. The potato crust, golden with sharp Cheddar cheese, blanketed a lamb stew, thickly spiced with thyme and rosemary. All winter, I had hoped something would push back at my interior polar vortex. This cast-iron pot of ground meat buried under mashed potatoes finally did.\n        \n\n         Other pub standards at the Shakespeare were true to form, like the highly credible bangers and mash and the fish and chips, with a light sheath of custardy batter around a hunk of very fresh cod. The Scotch eggs, molten at the yolk and wrapped in juicy, salty sausage before being plunged into the fryer, were good enough to eat by the dozen, although I would be round as an egg if I had tried.\n        \n\n         I was annoyed, though, when the $16 \u201cpint of prawns\u201d turned out to be a pint glass of ice cubes holding up five nearly flavorless boiled shrimp. The Shakespeare needs to do better than that if it wants customers to put the emphasis on the first word of \u201cgastro pub.\u201d Right now, it lands firmly on the second.\n        \n\n         The Shakespeare\u2019s two rooms have low timbered ceilings, and the one with the bar, where I sat, has two TVs bigger than some movie screens. I couldn\u2019t make out much beyond that because the place was crammed with after-work warriors there for the drinks, not the food. I couldn\u2019t hear much, either. But I did feel something: the creeping damp chill of a full pint of beer that someone, in the crush of bodies, had knocked over on me. A champion drink spiller myself, I wasn\u2019t upset. My soaked jeans did undercut the warming effect of the shepherd\u2019s pie, though.\n        \n\n         If I had wanted to get out of those wet clothes and into a dry martini, one of the two cocktail dens at the top of the stairs would have been the place to do it. The armchairs are plush, the paneling is polished, the fireplaces are burning (with gas, but still) and the bartenders don\u2019t smirk as they mix cocktails as well structured as a Savile Row suit. The William has given Midtown the hotel bar that I\u2019ve always wanted out of the Algonquin.\n        \n\n         The fireplaces came with the building. The plush and polish were supplied by Reid & Taylor Studios, which also designed the Peacock\u2019s two contrasting dining rooms. One has the flickering allure of the cocktail dens up front, along with emerald wallpaper in a peacock pattern. I wanted to eat below those peacocks. Apparently so did everyone else, because there were never any free tables. Instead, I was seated in what\u2019s called the Garden Room. Bright and oddly underdecorated, it is probably a better place for lunch than for the nocturnal consumption of meat pies.\n        \n\n         Mr. Aikens, a veteran of\n         \n          Le Gavroche\n         \n         in\n         \n\n\n          London\n         \n         , has done the gastro-pub thing before, as chef of\n         \n          the Dandelion\n         \n         in\n         \n\n\n          Philadelphia\n         \n         . He is far from a flashy cook. He just believes in doing things the right way, which often means the hard way. As our server put it, \u201cThe simpler the dish, the more complicated he makes it.\u201d\n        \n\n         For gammon steak, which in most parts of\n         \n\n\n          England\n         \n         would mean a slice of ham on a plate, canned pineapple optional, he starts from scratch. The ham is pork loin, brined in the kitchen, then grilled, as is the slab of fresh pineapple. Potato pur\u00e9e below, a sunny-side egg on top. I can\u2019t imagine finding a better gammon steak in England.\n        \n\n         Details elevate dishes like an honest chicken soup, or grilled Spanish mackerel on toast: the velvety, chardlike softness of the wilted spinach; the sweet-tart tension of the sherry vinaigrette; the crisp snap of the bacon.\n        \n\n         Roasted chicken came with a terrific plank of fresh pork-and-sage sausage and a run of gravy that neatly managed to taste rich but not oily. I appreciated the robust and musky spices and the fluffy grains of biriyani rice with a lamb curry straight from the kitchens of the Raj.\n        \n\n         The desserts are staunchly English and tended by Mr. Aikens himself. In another restaurant, this might relegate them to stepchild status, but not here. Mr. Aikens lavishes care on them, not to mention historical research and generous amounts of cream, eggs and butter. The result is a roster of sweets as deeply gratifying as any I\u2019ve spooned my way through in the past year.\n        \n\n         One night, Mrs. Beeton\u2019s Snow Egg appeared on the Shakespeare\u2019s blackboard. The dish, a version of the French oeufs \u00e0 la neige, comes from\n         \n          Isabella Beeton\u2019s 1861 manual\n         \n         on household management. In Mr. Aikens\u2019s hands, the meringue egg, rising from a sea of warm custard like steam from a hot bathtub, was studded with cracked pralines and decorated with kumquats in syrup.\n        \n\n         English cooks can work a hundred variations on the same idea, so another night brought a bowl of custard mixed with brioche crumbs below dime-size domes of meringue, melting and soft like marshmallows on a stick. Sandwiched in the middle was warm, fresh raspberry jam. It goes by the name the Queen of puddings, and asking for it is almost as good as eating it.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 3, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/02/dining/restaurant-review-the-peacock-and-the-shakespeare-in-midtown.html", "google_mag": 24.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n         You can put up with mediocre food in a restaurant that has other things going for it. When an exciting chef works in a terrible dining room, though, you feel the way you do when a friend hooks up with somebody you can\u2019t stand. You may visit the two of them once or twice to savor the full extent of the new partner\u2019s awfulness, but then you run for cover while you await the end.\n        \n\n         That\u2019s the reaction most diners had to\n         \n          Tenpenny when Chris Cipollone was the chef\n         \n         . Nearly everyone agreed that his food was terrific but that eating it in the charmless lobby of a Midtown hotel was like being buried alive with your last meal.\n        \n\n         When news of the breakup finally came, Mr. Cipollone\u2019s admirers began to hope they could start hanging out with him again. This summer, they got what they wanted, and Mr. Cipollone got the restaurant he deserved.\n        \n\n         Piora, next door to a\n         \n          West Village pet boutique\n         \n         where you can buy metallic-gold PVC dog collars, isn\u2019t large. The tables are leather-topped, as if you were about to sit down for a hand of whist, and they are hemmed in so snugly that when servers converged to set down three plates at once, they looked as if they were playing Twister. Right hand, trout! Left hand, suckling pig!\n        \n\n         But the place has been put together with intelligence and taste. You walk past a long bar attended by men in spotless white jackets, as if they had been flown in from Harry\u2019s Bar in\n         \n\n\n          Venice\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         Then you arrive in a square dining room with walls inscribed by long, sinuous horizontal lines. They look a bit like tentacles emanating from a sideways jellyfish, but they\u2019re strangely soothing, and they make the space look bigger. In another optical trick, the room seems to extend past the windows in the back to a tiered and illuminated garden that makes those of us with plants at home wonder why ours don\u2019t look this green in November.\n        \n\n         Mr. Cipollone has definitely traded up, and he\u2019s cooking as if he knows it. Imagine, if you can, four people fighting over carrots. It happened, and one of his appetizers was the cause. Some of the carrots were roasted in ham fat until they collapsed into their own sweetness; some had a humming spiciness locked inside them; under them was tangy white yogurt and on top, a pink drift of powder. \u201cHam snow,\u201d our server said. If there are Bac-Os in heaven, I had better get some religion, because this is what they\u2019ll taste like.\n        \n\n         Piora is owned by Mr. Cipollone and Simon Kim, a Korean-American who has management experience under\n         \n\n\n          Thomas Keller\n         \n         and\n         \n\n\n          Jean-Georges Vongerichten\n         \n         , and Korean flavors dart in and out of the menu. Mr. Cipollone makes fearless use of gochujang, the fermented hot-chile paste, blending it with shrimp stock and slathering it over crunchy and charred legs of grilled octopus. The gochujang, hot and deeply funky, is almost too much, but fresh basil leaves and candied pine nuts rein it in.\n        \n\n         But before you file Piora away under Asian fusion, be aware that the one thing you must eat is the pasta. Mr. Cipollone, an Italian-American, loves to play with pasta, but he is not chained to the traditions of\n         \n\n\n          Italy\n         \n         . He simmers black garlic bucatini in crab stock and tosses it with crab meat, adding maitake mushrooms for earthy depth. He underlines the candy-like flavor of roasted red kuri squash inside tortellini with a butternut squash juice that\u2019s a little less sweet, a two-note melody in the key of squash. Purple rigatoni \u2014 there\u2019s red wine in the dough \u2014 looked odd but tasted great, with peppery, fennel-seed-flecked duck sausage and lengths of the bitter green called spigarello.\n        \n\n         \u201cI like the tortellini,\u201d the best cook at my table said, \u201cbut I want the recipe for the rigatoni.\u201d\n        \n\n         Personally, I want to know how to make the side dish of toasted hazelnuts with crisp bits of caramelized sunchoke. It\u2019s as crunchy as granola and nearly as sweet, and I\u2019d eat it for breakfast.\n        \n\n         Life can\u2019t be all sunchoke granola and ham snow, though. Dullness creeps in. A pur\u00e9e of prunes stewed in tea wasn\u2019t dynamic enough to help the washed-out flavor of a duck confit appetizer fried in a puck. Even more spectral was the taste of a suckling pig main course, although a wonderful slaw of fried burdock root and radishes nearly made up for it.\n        \n\n         But dry-aged duck breast had a potent steakhouse intensity, and if its sauce of pur\u00e9ed jujubes, the Korean date, had a somewhat flat sweetness, duck jus enriched with black garlic gave it a savory kick. In a gentler mode, halibut was topped with sweet-sour ribbons of pickled butternut squash and given a last-minute swirl of toasty brown-butter fumet.\n        \n\n         Piora is about to hire its first pastry chef. With luck, it will land one who has better ideas than squirting lychee foam next to a gooey chocolate tart, or doubling down on the perfumey taste of Earl Grey cake with a scoop of Earl Grey sorbet. Until a new regime enters, I\u2019ll content myself with a glass of 12-year-old\n         \n\n\n          Guyana\n         \n         rum filtered one drop at a time through sliced bananas. It sounds like what you would put in the bottle of a baby with a drinking problem, but it is an excellent and serious nightcap. The men in the white jackets know their booze, and Piora\u2019s cocktails are tautly balanced and ungimmicky.\n        \n\n         This restaurant and chef are so pleased to have found each other that at times they fall into the slightly stiff good manners of somebody trying to impress future in-laws. The servers, in slate-colored striped aprons, are attentive, numerous and rather serious about this whole business of dinner. Ours can\u2019t be blamed for our fight over the carrots, having solemnly informed us when we sat down that Mr. Cipollone\u2019s food isn\u2019t meant to be eaten family-style but should be consumed in separate courses, one dish to each diner. You don\u2019t say. Now could someone please tell me what I\u2019m supposed to do with these shiny pieces of metal next to my plate?\n        \n\n         This style might play better in a grand restaurant like Per Se or\n         \n\n\n          Jean Georges\n         \n         than it does in this cozy back room on Hudson Street. Once Piora moves beyond its self-imposed formality, it and Mr. Cipollone can start to settle in and get comfortable. This time, it looks like things may last.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 4, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-piora-in-the-west-village.html", "google_mag": 25.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n         A few minutes into my first dinner at\n         \n\n\n          B\u00e2tard\n         \n         , it became obvious that the chef, Markus Glocker, has a sniper\u2019s accuracy at the stove. Nothing on his gracefully composed plates was chewier or crunchier or softer or saltier than it wanted to be. Mr. Glocker\u2019s kitchen chops were not exactly a surprise, given that he worked in\n         \n\n\n          Vienna\n         \n         for Heinz Reitbauer, in\n         \n\n\n          Chicago\n         \n         for\n         \n          Charlie Trotter\n         \n         and in\n         \n\n\n          London\n         \n         and New York for\n         \n          Gordon Ramsay\n         \n         , none of them ever known to have smiled indulgently at a young cook and said: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about burning those onions, kid. The customers won\u2019t notice.\u201d\n        \n\n         Technical prowess is a fine thing for a chef to have, but it\u2019s no guarantee of memorable, expressive cooking, just as a big vocabulary doesn\u2019t necessarily mean an author will write books worth reading. In both cases, you need to have something to say.\n        \n\n         Mr. Glocker has many things to say, and he says them clearly and with charm, as I learned over three excellent meals since\n         \n          B\u00e2tard\n         \n         opened in May. Some dishes were so successful they seemed destined never to leave the menu. One was the springtime-sweet bowl of minted pea soup with fried sweetbreads that seemed more flavorful than anybody else\u2019s sweetbreads. Another was a kind of bouillabaisse in which rabbit (a roasted loin, a perfectly cooked kidney and saffron ravioli with a light and delicately herbed rabbit filling) splashed around in the tomato-fennel-saffron broth. A month later, both dishes had been retired, and in their place was something new and just as wonderful.\n        \n\n         A fried zucchini flower, filled with bits of poached prawns and served with lightly candied lemon zest and whole pieces of poached lobster, was a full immersion in summer, a swim in a clear pond in the pines. A slab of octopus terrine, small circles of leg pressed together with smoky pastrami spices and dabbed with whole-grain mustard, evoked an entirely different terrain, nodding to the delicatessen, though the nuggets of braised ham hock, as rich and seductive as tuna belly, won\u2019t be found at Katz\u2019s.\n        \n\n         The complexity of Mr. Glocker\u2019s plates never blurs the focus of his flavors. Every drop of sauce and pinch of seasoning extracts some new pleasure out of the main ingredient. There is joy in his cooking.\n        \n\n         There are high spirits in B\u00e2tard\u2019s dining room, too, which hums and at times roars with the sound of people having a fine night on the town. This was not frequently heard during this restaurant\u2019s\n         \n          last incarnation\n         \n         ,\n         \n          Corton\n         \n         . Everyone whispered as if a baby were sleeping in the next room. Even\n         \n\n\n          Drew Nieporent\n         \n         , the avuncular saloonkeeper who has held the lease on this address since he opened it as\n         \n          Montrachet\n         \n         in 1985, seemed to tread across Corton\u2019s carpet on tiptoes.\n        \n\n         The carpet is gone. Mr. Nieporent and his partners in B\u00e2tard, Mr. Glocker and John Winterman, last seen as ma\u00eetre d\u2019h\u00f4tel at\n         \n          Daniel\n         \n         , had it replaced with herringbone floorboards. The white tablecloths have been whisked away, too.\n        \n\n         The architect\n         \n          Glen Coben\n         \n         gently raised the temperature on the interior that\n         \n          Stephanie Goto\n         \n         designed for Corton, which was elegant but aloof, more like a modern-art gallery than a restaurant. The walls that lean in and their twirling vines in bas-relief are flush with a tobacco-resin hue borrowed from Keith McNally\u2019s crayon box. Banquettes that had been covered with scallion-green fabric are now dark leather and mohair.\n        \n\n         If the bare tables and floors weren\u2019t enough to raise the decibel level, the amount of drinking going on would. Mr. Glocker\u2019s cooking plays well with others, and his flexible \u00e0 la carte menu, with a choice of two courses ($55), three ($65) or four ($75), encourages you to get to know a bottle or two. For some drinkers, it will be impossible not to order\n         \n\n\n          Burgundy\n         \n         at a restaurant called B\u00e2tard, and Jason Jacobeit, the head sommelier, is happy to oblige. Swimming alongside the white whales, the La T\u00e2che and Roman\u00e9e-Conti grand crus, are some lesser-known Burgundies at what are, by the region\u2019s standards at least, reasonable prices. (The list, however, needs more bottles under $60, no matter where they come from.) Nonconformists will find blue-chip\n         \n\n\n          Napa Valley\n         \n         wines and a deep pocket of whites from Alsace,\n         \n\n\n          Germany\n         \n         and\n         \n\n\n          Austria\n         \n         , where Mr. Glocker was born.\n        \n\n         B\u00e2tard is hardly a cruise down the beautiful blue Danube, but the kitchen can give you an excellent Viennese dinner in the form of the Poussin schnitzel, a special in perpetuity, and the Sacher torte, a special on occasion. Both are classical, the chef\u2019s fingerprints visible only in details like the mouthwatering sea buckthorn jam and unaccountably exciting potato salad with the schnitzel. When B\u00e2tard begins serving food at the bar, I suspect that every stool will be taken by a schnitzel-eater.\n        \n\n         Full of ideas, Mr. Glocker comes up with the desserts, too. His caramelized milk bread with berries and brown-butter ice cream is already a certified hit, the song of the summer that radio failed to provide this year. A slice of white bread, rich like brioche, has been glazed on both sides with a shatteringly thin shell of melted sugar. It looks like the simplest thing in the world, but if it\u2019s so simple, why isn\u2019t everyone making it? Other desserts are good, but not so good that the restaurant can do without a full-time pastry chef forever. The flat-footed key lime pie should be repaired or replaced, and the poached fruit in a moat of sparkling wine was a little too Ladies Who Lunch for me.\n        \n\n         Mr. Winterman, the general manager, has put together a lovely little cheese cart, although he hasn\u2019t figured out how to show it off. \u201cWe have several goat cheeses,\u201d my server said one night. \u201cSome cheese from\n         \n\n\n          France\n         \n         , of course. Some cheese from\n         \n\n\n          Vermont\n         \n         .\u201d Finding this picture a little vague, I asked to see them. This seemed to catch him off guard. \u201cI could bring the cart over,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it would be a little tight with these tables.\u201d\n        \n\n         The cheeses are much too good to be stranded on a landlocked cart. For now, you have to rely on Mr. Winterman to choose, and hope you\u2019ve come on a night when he has the honey made by downtown bees who do their buzzing above a Shoegasm store.\n        \n\n         There is another dance routine that needs practice. Maybe somebody imagined it would be fun for customers who get the vast, pink, terrific lamb chop to serve themselves lamb confit out of flame-colored Le Creuset pots. It\u2019s an awkward fishing party. The confit is some kind of new achievement in flavor and tenderness, but to get it out of the pot, you have to lift your butt off the seat.\n        \n\n         A few cards have yet to fall into place, but Mr. Glocker and Mr. Winterman are reshuffling the deck to get a fresh combination of refined and relaxed dining, a game Mr. Nieporent has played for years. One night, Mr. Winterman showed me a cross-section of a tree trunk. (Neither he nor Mr. Nieporent pretended not to recognize me.) He thinks it would be fun to drag it out to the dining room and let customers test their skill at Hammerschlagen, a game Germans play with a hammer and nails.\n        \n\n         If the baby isn\u2019t awake yet, that should do the trick.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 5, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/dining/restaurant-review-batard-in-tribeca.html", "google_mag": 31.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n         After a long and grueling winter, nothing lifts the spirits in springtime quite like an old-fashioned fish fight.\n        \n\n\n          Limani\n         \n         opened in November around the corner from the Rockefeller Center skating rink. Its menu is Greek, and its strength is formidably expensive seafood, which up until the moment it is laid on the grill can be found spread out on a small mountain of ice at the edge of the open kitchen. The modern dining room subliminally evokes the Aegean and has space for nearly 200 people at tables draped with white cloths.\n        \n\n         It all sounds peaceful enough. But four blocks away is\n         \n          Estiatorio Milos\n         \n         , which has operated on West 55th Street since 1997. It serves Greek food with a strong emphasis on formidably expensive seafood, which is displayed on a bed of ice near the open kitchen. The d\u00e9cor is modern and suggests the Aegean, the tablecloths are white, and there are easily enough chairs for 150.\n        \n\n         You might write this off to an uncanny coincidence if you didn\u2019t know that this Milos is a branch of one in\n         \n\n\n          Montreal\n         \n         and that this\n         \n\n\n          Limani\n         \n         is a branch of one in Roslyn, N.Y., whose founding manager worked in the Milos company for 16 years. The first chef in Roslyn was the original chef at Milos in New York. The owners have kept up traditions in\n         \n\n\n          Manhattan\n         \n         . Their kitchen is in the hands of M. J. Alam, who used to be the executive chef at Milos. Release the spiny lobsters: We have a fish fight.\n        \n\n         By longstanding tradition, a fish fight needs a referee. So, to begin with the most crucial item: As a rule, the array and quality of seafood at both establishments can give a seafood lover a happy case of\n         \n\n\n          vertigo\n         \n         . American standards like red snapper, bigeye tuna and black sea bass can be had, but there are far cheaper places to eat the standards. You go to Limani or Milos for creatures that circulate in the Mediterranean and the eastern Atlantic and generally migrate to New York only when somebody buys them a plane ticket.\n        \n\n         Among other species, both restaurants recently had the firm-fleshed John Dory, with its false eye staring out from its flank; rascasse, or\n         \n\n\n          scorpion fish\n         \n         , mild tasting and a traditional component of bouillabaisse; lavraki, or branzino, long and silvery and delicately sweet; and barbouni, or red mullet, a small fish whose full flavor is out of proportion to its size.\n        \n\n         Even more luxurious are the shellfish: firm and exquisitely flavored langoustines; spiny lobsters the size of a leg of lamb, with an intense taste that suggests a wild-game cousin of langoustines; live scallops, presented on the half shell with the slightly chewy, frilly band of mantle; and the heart-stoppingly sweet and supple red shrimp called carabineiros. Both restaurants serve red shrimp with a glass of sherry for the heads, although Milos suggests dunking the heads before sucking out the fat, while Limani advocates pouring the wine into the head and knocking it back, fat and all, like a J\u00e4germeister shot.\n        \n\n         In a perfect world, I would eat like this three times a week, with no regrets and no plaque in my arteries. In Midtown, which is still striving for perfection, a life like that would cost buckets of money.\n        \n\n         Limani is the cheaper restaurant, both in the menu prices and in the fish, which is sold by weight before cleaning. It charged me $85 a pound for those red shrimp, or about $17.50 each. Milos gave them to me for $95 a pound. Barbouni was $43 a pound at Limani and $61.50 at Milos.\n        \n\n         Limani is nobody\u2019s idea of a cheap night out, but the somewhat less fearsome seafood prices are a firm point in its favor. And it was only at Milos that I was served a fish that had stayed slightly too long on the flames, a whole fagri costing just over $80. It was also Milos that let scorched oil from the grill mar the lush taste of a $270 spiny lobster.\n        \n\n         On the rest of the menu, Limani\u2019s prices are merely expensive, while the ones at Milos read like a long series of typographical errors. The French fries are certainly worth $8, and by Manhattan standards $49 isn\u2019t out of line for three meaty, tender, very good double-cut lamb chops. But why $32 for a Greek salad, even if it had enough juicy, red, almost-summery tomatoes and creamy feta for four? And while the signature appetizer, a stack of fried zucchini and eggplant over a mound of tzatziki, was far lighter and more delicate than Limani\u2019s copycat version, paying $33 sucked the fun out of it. Prices seem to have doubled at least since 1997, when\n         \n          Ruth Reichl gave Milos two stars\n         \n         in its last\n         \n\n\n          New York Times\n         \n         review. Today, considering what happened to the fagri and spiny lobster, one star is more appropriate.\n        \n\n         But here things get complicated. Limani doesn\u2019t always duplicate its finesse at the grill throughout the kitchen. Gigante beans there were stewed in a tomato sauce that might have passed for canned soup. Desserts, except for a thick slab of yogurt with excellent honey or the fried dough balls rolled in cinnamon and honey syrup, called loukoumades, were not hard to pass up. At lunch, a tuna burger seemed determined to leave no impression at all, and a chicken kebab had me looking out the windows for the nearest halal cart. The afternoon was saved by an ideally cooked dorade royale.\n        \n\n         If money is not at the top of your pile of worries, or if you\u2019ll move it to the bottom of the pile for red shrimp and John Dory on the grill, then the choice between Limani and Milos may come down to style.\n        \n\n         Milos\u2019s d\u00e9cor is a one-of-a-kind blend of exposed structural columns in bare concrete and weathered Greek artifacts, including amphorae big enough to hide a pair of rodeo clowns. The split-level dining room is loud, lively and full of people who act like regulars. Service is practiced, and can be charming. A few years ago, when I was seated between a pillar and a low concrete wall, a server popped up on the other side of the wall and said with a winning smile, \u201cYou have my favorite table!\u201d\n        \n\n         Limani, which in nearly every other respect swims in Milos\u2019s wake, darts off on its own in the interior-design department. The floor of the dining room is done in blinding white marble, and the leather seats are a softer white. In the center is an infinity pool that keeps changing from blue to violet, the colors glinting off the small metal fish on a mobile that hangs in a double helix from the ceiling overhead. Some people will look at it and see a Greek fishing town taken over by millionaires. I saw South Beach.\n        \n\n         By now, though, readers who give any thought to their dinner budgets have no doubt decided to run screaming from Midtown and head straight for Astoria,\n         \n\n\n          Queens\n         \n         . For starters, let me suggest Astoria Seafood, which is like Limani or Milos but with no luxuries, fewer kinds of fish and check totals that don\u2019t rival the round-trip fare to\n         \n\n\n          Athens\n         \n         .\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 7, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/dining/restaurant-reviews-limani-and-estiatorio-milos-in-midtown.html", "google_mag": 25.700000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n            By the early 1980s, New Yorkers knew that something major was happening in the kitchens of California. They had heard about the revolution, but most of them hadn\u2019t tasted it until Jonathan Waxman opened Jams in 1984. Here was a report from the West Coast front lines brought by a chef fresh from Michael\u2019s in Santa Monica and, before that, Chez Panisse in Berkeley.\n           \n\n            To put it in terms readers born after 1980 will understand, this was a bit like being the first person in town to have cooked at both\n            \n             Noma\n            \n            and\n            \n             Relae\n            \n            , but bigger. Styles in food didn\u2019t get around as fast in those days.\n           \n\n            Jams had an open kitchen. Mesquite flared under the grill. Vegetables, in their prime, were barely cooked. Salsa, citrus and cilantro breezed in. Low-fat sauces sat beneath the meat and fish, not smothering them on top. Small portions (critics called them \u201cstingy\u201d and \u201cskimpy\u201d) were ringed by arctic expanses of white china.\n           \n\n            Mr. Waxman brought a loose, unbuttoned American spirit to nouvelle cuisine, still nouvelle at the time, and the city loved it. Andy Warhol went to the Upper East Side to eat at Jams once or twice a week, Factory apparatchiks in tow.\n           \n\n            Then came overexpansion and the 1987 stock market crash. As the decade ended, one of its most influential restaurants went down with it. I can\u2019t blame Mr. Waxman for dreaming he would bring Jams back from the grave one day.\n           \n\n            But after a few meals at the\n            \n             Jams\n            \n            that returned to Manhattan in August, I also can\u2019t help wishing it had stayed there. This zombie Jams, at the corner of 58th Street and Avenue of the Americas, inside the 1 Hotel Central Park, trudges ahead steadily, but it\u2019s stiff in the joints and short on joie de vivre.\n           \n\n            Some writers have seen the return of Jams as a sign that \u201980s cuisine is coming back. But anyone who shows up with a\n            \n             Flock of Seagulls haircut\n            \n            expecting to see customers exclaiming over kiwis and Jay McInerney doing lines of Bolivian marching powder in the men\u2019s room will be disappointed.\n           \n\n            The first sign that this revival will not set any new paradigms is the design of the dining room, which looks like a reclaimed factory. You\u2019ve been in this room before, downtown or in Williamsburg. White pipes and ducts creep along a soaring ceiling, and the walls are scraped down to the bricks and structural terra cotta. The wood tables are bare, the chairs midcentury in style.\n           \n\n            There are some flashbacks to the original, like visible flames in the open kitchen, and a handful of items branded as Jams classics on the menu. The Jams chicken, half a bird grilled over wood, is charred on the skin and juicy inside, dressed with a little tarragon butter. It won\u2019t eclipse the roast chicken with a crackling skin that has made Mr. Waxman\u2019s downtown restaurant,\n            \n             Barbuto\n            \n            , a landmark, but it could be the centerpiece of a fine relaxed dinner if you are in the neighborhood.\n           \n\n            Mr. Waxman does not lay the pieces of bird in a nest of skinny, golden fries the way he did in the \u201980s, which is just as well because the Jams fries are soggy with oil and can be limp, too. They arrive with the Jams burger, a juiceless, saltless, flavorless flap of overcooked meat that could have come from the most influential Greek diner of the \u201980s. It would have been a complete loss without the help of bacon, cheese and aioli.\n           \n\n            The Jams pancakes, pink with sweet red peppers, were starting to curl at the edges when they appeared and weren\u2019t quite tender. They weren\u2019t cooked four decades ago, but apparently they weren\u2019t cooked four minutes ago, either. There were three, each topped with a twirl of bagel-shop-grade smoked salmon and just enough caviar to cover my thumbnail in a single layer. Only the summery creamed corn with flecks of red pepper spread out under the pancakes had any real flavor.\n           \n\n            A restaurant that trips over its signature dishes is as hard to trust as a person who misspells his own name. (Good thing there are only four letters in Jams.) The chicken aside, I tended to have better luck when I treated the Jams name as a warning label and ordered things without it.\n           \n\n            Toasted fregola sarda under a big heap of plump mussels in a tomato broth warmly spiced with chorizo, for instance. Or the seared gnocchi with lots of corn, a little lobster and some cherry tomatoes. Or the hunk of swordfish, gently cooked so the interior still had a tinge of pink, with a smooth and mild romesco.\n           \n\n            Desserts can be likably retro, such as the simple and very fresh apple turnover made with puff pastry, or the more complicated charlotte with toasted ladyfingers forming a soft fence around a filling of moist, fruity fig jam. Recently the menu promised a \u201cGerman chocolate angel food cake\u201d; while it was nowhere near as angelically light as the name implied, it still had its appeal.\n           \n\n            But the non-branded items can also be tricky. Rigatoni with crab in a spicy sauce was fine up to a point, that point being the rigatoni itself. Some tubes were floppily overcooked, others leathery and half-raw at the ends.\n           \n\n            The ingredients, which do a lot of the work at Barbuto, sometimes seem unwilling to lend a hand at Jams. The cooked fresh tuna tossed with aioli and piled on a bun (a sandwich sold, misleadingly, as pan bagnat) had almost no presence. A raw fluke appetizer with cubes of flavorless, brown-spotted avocado tasted like nothing except salt.\n           \n\n            Servers do their best to cope with delays between courses that can stretch up to 20 minutes even when the dining room isn\u2019t full. They seem well trained, delivering smart wine recommendations with confidence. But some of the lines they\u2019ve been given are odd. Mine volunteered the information that the aioli on the burger \u201cis a garlic mayonnaise.\u201d For a minute, it really did seem like 1984 again.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 9, "rating": "Satisfactory", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/dining/jams-jonathan-waxman-review.html", "google_mag": 26.600000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n         Just after I accepted the fact that I was in love with a dish called vegan chicharrones locos, a phrase from Freud ran through my head. The phrase was \u201cthe return of the repressed,\u201d and it seemed relevant, somehow, to these fried squares of puffed wheat at\n         \n          El Rey Coffee Bar & Luncheonette\n         \n         on the Lower East Side.\n        \n\n         Porkless chicharrones would have struck me as sacrilegious a few years ago. At the time, I was busily cheering on the new cult of animal-flesh worship that was burying the joyless orthodoxy of the low-fat diet beneath slabs of pork belly. White meat, steamed vegetables and olive oil were elbowed aside to make room for chicken liver toasts, marrow bones and whipped lard. Chefs and avid eaters scorned anything that might qualify as health food, which by the standards of the time included any vegetable cooked without bacon.\n        \n\n         But as Freud knew, repressed urges find ways of bobbing to the surface again.\n        \n\n         Last decade, the return of the repressed looked like an entire pork shoulder torn apart by people who would leave the table with the glazed look of an anaconda that happened across a slow-moving deer. In this decade, it looks like puffed brown rice with raw cauliflower pebbles and kale at\n         \n          Sqirl\n         \n         in Los Angeles. It looks like an Allen Street marquee of Times Square dimensions screaming\n         \n          DIRT CANDY\n         \n         above Amanda Cohen\u2019s vegetable circus-slash-restaurant. It looks like chia pudding with hemp at\n         \n          Dimes\n         \n         on Canal Street, where they put wheat grass in their margaritas.\n        \n\n         And it looks like vegan chicharrones locos at El Rey. The dish turns a Mexican street snack, chicharrones de harina, into a salad, and turns salad into an event. These mock pork skins are tossed with mint and sticks of raw jicama in a bowl, the vessel of choice for return-of-the-repressed dishes across the country. They are dusted with smoldering Aleppo pepper and lemony ground sumac, strafed by a terrific hot sauce of chiles and pickled pineapple and mellowed with a nondairy cashew cream.\n        \n\n         Nicholas Morgenstern, the proprietor of GG\u2019s and\n         \n          Morgenstern\u2019s Finest Ice Cream\n         \n         , opened El Rey in 2013 with little more than an espresso machine and some shelves of pastries baked by Gerardo Gonzalez. Luncheonette was appended to the name when Mr. Gonzalez was promoted to chef a few months later. When El Rey was reviewed by Ligaya Mishan in a\n         \n          Hungry City column\n         \n         the following year, it served breakfast and lunch.\n        \n\n         Friends I trusted kept telling me that I needed to check it out. They said things like \u201cthe food is exactly what I feel like eating.\u201d They renewed their calls after February, when the dinner menu sprouted up. All these friends were women, and when I finally took their advice, I noticed that in the dining room, men were always outnumbered by women (they had yoga stomachs, quick eyes and nails as colorful and glossy as a Mini Cooper on the dealer\u2019s lot). I wouldn\u2019t read too much into this observation, but it seems worth mentioning because the voices that brayed most loudly about the virtues of animal fat tended to be male.\n        \n\n         The pieces of this tiny restaurant fit together like an empty wallet and a new $20 bill. Two high tables are each surrounded by four metal stools. A few more seats crouch beneath a counter that looks onto Stanton Street, and three more face an area the size of a bathtub with a single induction burner. This passes for the kitchen.\n        \n\n         Neon script on the back wall spells the restaurant\u2019s name in swimming-pool blue. The service is California chill. Ordering is uncomplicated. El Rey has few of the comforts of a larger, more elaborate restaurant, but none of the discomforts, either.\n        \n\n         Mr. Gonzalez is a native of San Diego. In his short time at El Rey, he has worked out a point of view in the kitchen that is distinctly his own, a blend of California-Mexican cuisine with some of the less punitive flavors from the health-food and vegan disciplines.\n        \n\n         In these tight quarters, his menu necessarily favors assemblage over cooking, by which I mean dinner will probably feature at least one salad. There is chopped kale that tastes brighter and more refreshing than the routine version. The shaved cauliflower number sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds has more surprises; it softens and picks up flavor as it soaks up the chickpea-tahini vinaigrette and the yolk of a poached egg.\n        \n\n         Other dishes have more ballast, but nothing will make you feel like an anaconda. Warm, marinated chorizo is essentially a tapas portion with something extra: chopped hazelnuts and threads of orange zest. Octopus, sliced dime-thin and marinated, Cuban style, is mixed with chopped hominy and tomatillo; it sits on white beans that have been pur\u00e9ed with squid ink, garlic oil and black garlic. I was still wondering if I\u2019d ever tasted white beans put to such interesting use as I scraped the last smudges from the plate.\n        \n\n         Mr. Gonzalez has devised a winning, original tostada: shaved carrots and smoked sardines on a crackerlike corn tortilla on which whipped butter and thick yogurt are spread. Butter and sardines are longtime dance partners, but what sends them trotting off in new directions is the salsa verde of carrot greens.\n        \n\n         The kitchen has limitations, and not all of them can be blamed on lack of space. The brief menu reaches for the crunch factor of nuts a little too often. Should you eat the papas bravas the same night as the chicharrones locos, you may wish they did not both depend on the pineapple hot sauce and the cashew cream. But if you have them on their own, the crisp skins of little blue potatoes knocking up against pickled chunks of pineapple, you\u2019ll simply wish you had more.\n        \n\n         To drink, you may have a good oddball wine, or a twist on the michelada rimmed with Aleppo pepper, or white sangria turned green by shiso and cucumber, which gives you the pleasant illusion that you are fortifying your body with nutritious juices and not just knocking back one glass of wine after another.\n        \n\n         At the end of dinner, there is usually a single dessert in addition to whatever pastries the daytime crowd didn\u2019t make off with. One sultry May night, Mr. Gonzalez had carved up buttery lobes of Champagne mango, spooned mango pickle sauce on top and scooped some mango-passion fruit sorbet on the side. It was exactly what I felt like eating.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 10, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/dining/restaurant-review-el-rey-coffee-bar-luncheonette-on-the-lower-east-side.html", "google_mag": 24.200000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n            Little Pepper began life a dozen years ago in the competitive Chinese nucleus of downtown Flushing, Queens. Five years ago, Cheng Ying Wu and her husband, Gui Ping Huang, the owners, moved it northwest to College Point, where its nearest rival is a graffiti-scrawled storefront across the street selling takeout chop suey and chow mein. Little Pepper is not entirely free of American Chinese food, but its pork lo mein is not one of its chief attractions.\n           \n\n            The reason to drive to College Point Boulevard (by far the easiest way to get to Little Pepper, about a 20-minute bus ride from the nearest subway stop) is to eat undiluted Sichuan cooking, like silken tofu with scallions. Little chilled blocks of tofu will be covered with scallions and chopped peanuts turned the color of bricks by chile oil. Woven through the burning heat of the oil will be the unmistakable, medicinal hum of Sichuan peppercorns. The crunch and burn and throb of the sauce crashes against the soft and passive tofu; the contrast enhances both.\n           \n\n            Or the kitchen may take another slab of silken tofu and do something else. This time it will be warm, in bigger chunks that cleave into two pieces at the touch of a spoon. The dressing will be tangy bits of ground pork in black vinegar and a shimmering gloss of chile oil. The dish, of course, is ma-po tofu. At Little Pepper, it combines power and nuance to make other renditions around the city seem heavy-handed.\n           \n\n            Some New Yorkers grade Sichuan food by its firepower. When their tongues have been reduced to smoldering ruins, they declare themselves (through sign language) to be in a great restaurant. Little Pepper is capable of inflicting great pain when needed. Its Chong Qing chicken, which weaponizes capsaicin in just about every known form and should not be faced without a full glass of water or beer at hand, is proof of that. But what sets Little Pepper apart from the many other good Sichuan restaurants in the city is its skill at bringing spicy forces into tense alignment with sweet, sour and salty ones.\n           \n\n            It\u2019s possible that the chefs at Little Pepper cook with extra precision because real estate is cheaper in College Point than in Flushing, allowing the owners to spring for the roomy, shipshape kitchen in the back. This at least is what I tell myself as I\u2019m driving past the exit for Flushing and Little Pepper is still another 15 minutes away.\n           \n\n            I\u2019ve always found a parking space within sight of the front door, which doesn\u2019t often happen in downtown Flushing. Inside, there is art everywhere: a mural of oversize peonies in red and pink; small canvases of an empty, wrinkled red plastic bag and a still life with Spam; a larger painting of a crushed Coke can over the round table where in quiet moments the employees top and tail a heap of beans for the excellent dry-saut\u00e9ed string beans.\n           \n\n            English is not one of the restaurant\u2019s core competencies. In the middle of my last lunch there, a waiter handed the phone to one of my guests. What did he want? It was unclear at first. Eventually an odd relay game began; my guest talked to a customer who was trying to place a takeout order, then looked for each dish on the menu and pointed. Finally the waiter wrote it down. It took about five minutes. When the customer walked in to get his food, it was like seeing a minor celebrity.\n           \n\n            I don\u2019t recall what he ate, but everything I had is bright in my memory. First, super-crisp scallion pancake wedges dunked in a black, tangy, syrup-thick sauce. Then thin, chewy slices of beef tendon in chile oil, classic and great. Thin-skinned dumplings of juicy, sweet pork followed, resting in a pool of vinegar and chile oil. Saut\u00e9ed snow pea leaves were next, and too salty.\n           \n\n            At last a big main course: \u201clamb with hot and spicy sauce,\u201d also known as cumin lamb because that spice dominated the intensely fragrant dry rub clinging to the tender strips of meat. (There was no sauce to speak of, just stir-fried onions and green chiles.) And a whole fish hidden below fiery ground pork sauce, lip-smacking and deeply flavorful, like a Bolognese by way of Chengdu.\n           \n\n            The fish at Little Pepper often tastes muddy. The sauces, though, are so transporting that it doesn\u2019t matter very much. And while not every dish on the menu is the best in town \u2014 the shredded potatoes with green peppers are pretty bland \u2014 the overall energy and variety of the cooking more than makes up for it.\n           \n\n            With so many peppers whiplashing around, the mouth needs something mild for balance. Tea-smoked duck dripping with warm fat is a fine and soothing appetizer. Cold smashed cucumbers with garlic are turning up in non-Chinese restaurants now, but few improve on the ones at Little Pepper. Corn kernels stir-fried with pine nuts are strangely easy to get along with. Fried rice, cooked with so much finely minced scallion that it turns the color of a Shamrock Shake, is a superb mop for fiery sauces.\n           \n\n            On some days, I have gone giddy for the eggplant, as soft as pudding and slick with garlic sauce. On others, I\u2019ve been sweetly captivated by the riddle of preserved eggs with green peppers. The riddle is not how the egg whites turn dark brown and transparent, while the yolks go creamily soft and ash-colored; that\u2019s explained by the chemistry of a pH shift. What I can\u2019t figure out is why the eggs\u2019 mild whiff of sulfur is so appealing when they are eaten together with chopped mild green chiles and decidedly unmild red chile oil.\n           \n\n            But this is nothing compared with the enigma of Little Pepper\u2019s \u201cfried potato in hot sauce.\u201d These are crinkle-cut French fries that, as far as I can tell, come out of a bag stored in the freezer. They are dark and ragged with a dry spice mix of coarsely ground cumin, roasted dried chiles, Sichuan peppercorns, salt and maybe MSG.\n           \n\n            The questions torture me. How did crinkle-cut fries get into a Sichuan restaurant? How can I be so helplessly, irretrievably crazy about them? Why, when they cool and lose their allure, do I want to ask the waiter to drop them back into the fryer again? Is something wrong with me? What is this wild desire? And where is the hot sauce?\n           \n\n\n\n              Read This Review in Chinese\n             \n\n\n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 11, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/dining/little-pepper-review.html", "google_mag": 24.5}, {"review_text": "\n            WASHINGTON \u2014 I have now spent roughly twice as many hours standing on the sidewalk outside\n            \n             Bad Saint\n            \n            as I have spent inside eating its Filipino food.\n           \n\n            This is not an ideal ratio, but at least I had company. Bad Saint, in this city\u2019s Columbia Heights neighborhood, has never taken reservations since it began operating in 2015. The line that begins forming on 11th Street at least two hours before the doors open at 5:30 p.m. is by now as much a part of the experience of having dinner at Bad Saint as hanging out in the stadium parking lot is a part of the experience of seeing a Phish concert.\n           \n\n            Repeat customers are common and easy to spot. They\u2019re the ones who have brought folding chairs, bottles of water, boxes of wine, volumes of Murakami and Ferrante, and bug spray to keep away the mosquitoes who also like dining at Bad Saint. Blankets appear as the weather gets chilly; in scheduling my meals for this review, I watched the approach of winter as anxiously as covered-wagon pioneers eyed the clouds over the Donner Pass.\n           \n\n            To pass the time before I was allowed to eat Bad Saint\u2019s extraordinary Filipino food, I chatted with\n            \n             Blelvis\n            \n            , the Black Elvis, who challenged me to name a song of Mr. Presley\u2019s he did not know, and felt mildly ashamed of myself when I stumped him with\n            \n             \u201cFroggy Went a-Courtin\u2019.\u201d\n            \n\n\n            I tried not to eavesdrop as a woman gave her friend a year-by-year account of her decades-long marriage and the affair that took it down. I met a paid line-stander who said that waiting outside a restaurant for three to four hours paled beside his greatest achievement: camping out in front of the Supreme Court for more than a week on behalf of a client who wanted to hear the oral arguments in the same-sex marriage case.\n           \n\n            Absorbing as these intervals were, I felt relief and joy each time the four bamboo blinds would be raised in unison at 5:30 by four servers, one of whom would then unlock the door and start filling the 24 seats.\n           \n\n            Genevieve Villamora, the partner who most often handles this task, has compared it to a game of Tetris. The largest tables hold just four people, as some parties of five or six have learned to their regret. All the other seats are jimmied into blind alleys and passageways around the open kitchen. Once they are all taken, Ms. Villamora takes names and numbers for openings later in the night.\n           \n\n            With a woven Filipino mat on the wall and light filtering down from geometric slashes in a ceiling of oxidized-steel tiles, the restaurant has a certain compulsory intimacy. It\u2019s easy to strike up a conversation with somebody, although it won\u2019t necessarily be the somebody you arrived with. Seated at a shallow ledge in the back one night, I stood up to talk to one of my dining partners, who was three seats away. The arrangement had a cocktail-party charm until I was asked to return to my seat; I was blocking the path to the restroom.\n           \n\n            Clearly, Bad Saint was built to make the best of its scarce square footage, not to handle the pressure of being one of Washington\u2019s most sought-after restaurants. Now it has to do both, because the food that Tom Cunanan and his cooks prepare under columns of wok smoke is richly compelling no matter how many prior run-ins you\u2019ve had with Filipino food.\n           \n\n            Most people with a glancing knowledge of the cuisine have tried an adobo, a garlic-laden stew braised in soy sauce that\u2019s been soured with vinegar. But Bad Saint\u2019s adobo of tender squid is still astonishing, its sauce deepened and darkened by squid ink and given a slow, lingering burn by long peppers.\n           \n\n            The oxtails and bok choi stewed in peanut sauce with an intense undercurrent of shrimp and anchovies is amazing whether this is your first encounter with kare-kare or your hundredth.\n           \n\n            I love bitter melon, but even the skeptics I\u2019d brought with me were won over by Bad Saint\u2019s stir-fry, in which the vegetable\u2019s aggressive tendencies are offset by fermented black beans, softened by eggs and sweetened by a topcoat of fried shallots. My guests were even more dubious about pancit canton, a Filipino lo mein that can be reassuringly bland. As interpreted by Mr. Cunanan, with lots of royal trumpet mushrooms and a steady thrum of Calabrian chiles, it is startlingly good.\n           \n\n            Ms. Villamora and her partner in the restaurant, Nick Pimentel, have Filipino heritage but were born and raised in the United States. (The restaurant\u2019s name is derived from St. Malo, La., the first Filipino settlement in this country.) Mr. Cunanan was born in the Philippines and has called his mother his main inspiration in the kitchen. Some of the cooking has a homey simplicity, like the arroz caldo, chicken in a ginger-laced rice porridge that can be cranked up with a dab of red chile paste or left to its own, soothing charms.\n           \n\n            In other dishes, Mr. Cunanan stretches tradition to wrap it around local ingredients. In the Philippines, laing would be made by stewing dried taro leaves in coconut milk. At Bad Saint, the leaves are kale, braised to a velvety tenderness and swaddled in Chesapeake crab meat. This laing is so luxuriously flavorful, I can\u2019t get it out of my head, and I don\u2019t want to.\n           \n\n            If you don\u2019t get into the first seating, you might spend the cocktail hour checking the screen on your phone while you wait a few doors down at\n            \n             Room 11\n            \n            , also owned in part by Mr. Pimentel. Once you gain entry, you can have one of the Filipino-influenced mixed drinks like the Chili Manilli (spicier than I wanted with this food) or a home-brewed green mango soda (lovely).\n           \n\n            Bad Saint carried about three wines when it opened. Now the selection is almost long enough to be called a list, and is wisely centered on lively, aromatic bottles like a red grenache from Tarragona or a still white from Catalonia that is a blend of xarello and riesling. The beers are even more esoteric and reflect this restaurant\u2019s easy assurance that people come here to be turned on to something new.\n           \n\n            I especially admire Bad Saint\u2019s refusal to translate Filipino food into the European-derived idioms of fine dining. When the servers say the dishes are served family style, they mean it. There\u2019s no artfully blank space on the plates, no Abstract Expressionist smears of sauce. The food goes from the wok to the plate, and it is relentlessly delicious.\n           \n\n            Because the cuisine of the Philippines is so closely tied to home cooking, it\u2019s been hard to imagine what a three-star Filipino restaurant would look like. Now I know that it looks like Bad Saint.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 12, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/dining/bad-saint-dc-review.html", "google_mag": 28.0}, {"review_text": "\n            Restaurants have made bar food their own. In fancy kitchens serving fancy dining rooms, chefs have found almost inconceivably fancy ways to make pub and roadhouse food. The burgers are ground to order and slapped on rolls fresh out of the oven; the hot dogs are squirted with proprietary condiments; the Tater Tots are enrolled in elite private day care.\n           \n\n            Bars have to fight back somehow. Some of the smartest ones are taking the high road. They\u2019re serving what would have been considered\n            \n             fairly ambitious restaurant food\n            \n            back when categories like that still made sense.\n           \n\n            To get to\n            \n             Karasu\n            \n            , you enter a small and well-populated corner tavern called Walter\u2019s, across from Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn. You walk past the bar, past the kitchen, past the restrooms, and stop when you get to the midnight-blue wall in the back. At this point, some people decide they\u2019re in the wrong place and walk out. Don\u2019t. Locate the handle, push gently on the door and step inside.\n           \n\n            These speakeasy shenanigans may annoy you, particularly when the speakeasy in question is advertised on a chalkboard out on the sidewalk, but it\u2019s hard to hold a grudge once you\u2019re inside. Dark and tranquil, its only window so near the ceiling that the room is effectively cloistered from the street, Karasu is a refuge from noise and crowds.\n           \n\n            The first surprising thing about the food is that there is any. The second is that it\u2019s so polished and considered.\n           \n\n            The kitchen is a box at the end of the bar so cramped that most D.J.\u2019s would refuse to work in it. A space this size usually calls for reduced expectations. Yael Peet and Elena Yamamoto, the chefs, have other ideas. Their menu can read like an izakaya\u2019s, but the plates have all sorts of subtle flourishes that most izakayas wouldn\u2019t bother with.\n           \n\n            Sashimi could be a matter of shopping and slicing. At Karasu, it\u2019s more than that. On a recent night, bonito was marinated in soy and sake, then gently smoked over smoldering mesquite. Finally, it was rolled in ground sesame and seared. A lot had happened to this tuna, but the flavors were restrained, and very agreeable.\n           \n\n            The wonderful Japanese sweet potatoes, just coming into season, had been deep-fried with kabocha squash and set in a soy-enhanced syrup. Steamed hard-shell clams were excellent in ponzu sauce, and thin slices of octopus made a welcome appearance with crunchy marinated cucumbers.\n           \n\n            Some things, like the terrific assortment of pickled daikon, work best as punctuation marks between sips of cocktails. When you start thinking about dinner, there is pasta with mentaiko sauce; the spicy red dots of cod roe are embellished with uni, and the thin noodles were rolled and cut on the premises, somewhere. One night they were slightly limp, always a risk with fresh pasta, but on another they were ideally firm and bouncy.\n           \n\n            If more serious hunger calls, there is a generous tonkatsu, left fairly thick and fried on the bone. Still more impressive is the koji-rubbed rib-eye, forcefully blackened on both sides and served sliced in a skillet, basted in its own fat. In the heat of the moment, I declared that it was better than the steak at Peter Luger. I am pretty sure I meant it.\n           \n\n            The first few times I walked through the black door, what I had in mind was a mixed drink or two. Overseen by Thomas Waugh, formerly the chief barman at\n            \n             ZZ\u2019s Clam Bar\n            \n            in Manhattan, they reflect the punctilious Japanese approach to cocktail culture. (The heavy brass mold behind the bar that will melt the corners off a large ice cube and turn it into a large ice ball comes from Japan.) Some of the drinks, like a refocused mai tai called the Nettai, paddle through the lagoons of Polynesia with restraint and elegance, an unusual sight in those lagoons.\n           \n\n\n\n            Wine is in the genetic makeup of\n            \n             Zadie\u2019s Oyster Room\n            \n            , in the East Village. It replaces a wine bar called Fifty Paces, which replaced a wine bar called Terroir. The common thread linking all three is the chef\n            \n             Marco Canora\n            \n            . Mr. Canora converted Terroir to Fifty Paces soon after splitting with his business partner Paul Grieco, and the place had the provisional quality often found in the apartments of freshly divorced men. With Zadie\u2019s, he seems to have regained his footing.\n           \n\n            Zadie\u2019s chef, Devin Dearden, devotes his menu to the oyster in all its edible forms. Oysters are of course served raw on ice, with a good mignonette and an irrelevant cocktail sauce. But they are also broiled under minced seaweed and Parmigiano-Reggiano in a nervy, compelling take on oysters Rockefeller; poached in sherry and cream along with late-summer succotash for a soup that is halfway between oyster stew and chowder; and steamed with garlic, vermouth and butter, a suave oyster-dunking sauce that becomes a soup once you add oyster crackers.\n           \n\n            The only dud method is pickling, and the problem there may have been that the oysters were lost amid a heap of bitter greens and pur\u00e9ed seaweed.\n           \n\n            Mr. Canora seems to have realized that the huge growth in cultivating oysters hasn\u2019t been matched by similar progress in cooking them. New York restaurants serve them raw, almost invariably. If Zadie\u2019s can nudge a few chefs into rethinking this, it could signify the start of a new chapter in the city\u2019s long relationship with oysters.\n           \n\n            And if not, I\u2019ll still drop by when I\u2019 m craving smoked bluefish spread, a New England treat that almost never turns up this far south. And I\u2019ve never craved a tuna melt in my life, but that may only be because I\u2019d never tasted the one at Zadie\u2019s.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 13, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/19/dining/karasu-zadies-oyster-room-review.html", "google_mag": 22.399999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n            Anybody who tries to tell you that the place to go for Indian food is Jackson Heights, Queens, hasn\u2019t been there in a long time. Beyond question, Jackson Heights is the first stop for anyone seeking an education in the Tibetan syllabus: momos filled with brothy beef under their bellybutton pleats; laphing, noodles neatly rolled and sliced like strudel and set loose in a puddle of chile oil; steaming, salty, bracing cups of yak butter tea. Most of the neighborhood\u2019s places for samosas and naan, though, either are gone or have faded into insignificance.\n           \n\n            You less often meet somebody who sends you to Curry Hill for the cooking of India. But it\u2019s the correct answer. Once known mainly for cheap buffet lunches (Haandi, long the reigning champion of the steam table, is still one of Manhattan\u2019s unnatural wonders), Lexington Avenue in the upper 20s has over the past few years become home to the most diverse and concentrated hub of Indian restaurants in New York City.\n           \n\n            A disproportionate amount of this diversity is the work of two veteran chefs and restaurateurs. Shiva Natarajan opened one Curry Hill restaurant that\n            \n             paid tribute to Kolkata\n            \n            , particularly its Jewish cuisine; another that showcased food from India\u2019s southwest coast; a third that brought together dishes from the cities of Lucknow and Hyderabad; and a fourth that specialized in the Punjab.\n           \n\n            He sold all four to\n            \n             Hemant Mathur\n            \n            two years ago. Together they started working on a fifth, Sahib. It opened in the fall.\n           \n\n            More than those other restaurants, one of which has closed, Sahib darts around India. Mr. Natarajan, who worked as the consulting chef, organized the menu around dishes he has been gathering in India while researching a cookbook. He isn\u2019t trying to be encyclopedic, and the menu reflects that; it pays a little bit of attention to several regions and ignores others entirely. This makes it hard to get a firm sense of any one regional style, but easy to enjoy several dishes you may have never seen before.\n           \n\n            This may even be true for Indians. Goans might not recognize Sahib\u2019s wonderful blend of fried eggplant stirred into a smoky mash of eggplant that has been softened in a tandoor; the dish, only casually spiced, comes from the northern city of Varanasi, on the Ganges.\n           \n\n            Potatoes are stewed all over India, but Sahib\u2019s dum olav may be new to those who aren\u2019t from Kashmir. Little round potatoes are stabbed with a toothpick first so they will pick up more of the sauce they\u2019re cooked in: yogurt seasoned with tamarind, cardamom and Kashmiri chiles. The sauce wins its arguments through persuasion rather than force, in part because it has no tomatoes or onions.\n           \n\n            To see what a difference leaving them out can make, try the rogan josh. If you\u2019ve had this Kashmiri lamb dish at other local Indian restaurants, you probably think of rogan josh as a bulldozer of a dish, more powerful than graceful. Chances are onions and tomatoes were the ground floor on which the thick brown gravy was built. At Sahib, the sauce is creamier and gentle enough that the taste of saffron doesn\u2019t get lost, and I found myself really paying attention to the flavors \u2014 a new experience when it comes to rogan josh.\n           \n\n            If the lamb in both that dish and another I tried was very slightly more chewy than my ideal, it\u2019s also true that the goat never let me down. In the marchwagan korma, a curry from Kashmir, goat was cooked on the bones in a rich and intensely aromatic yogurt sauce. Nothing I had at Sahib was noisily spicy, but the Kashmiri chiles in this korma made themselves heard.\n           \n\n            From the city of Mangalore on the Arabian Sea comes kori gassi, a very mild and irresistible chicken stew; coriander, asafetida and curry leaves season the coconut milk.\n           \n\n            The recipe for Mr. Natarajan\u2019s chicken biryani comes from Lucknow. Made with both yogurt and milk, cooked in a pot sealed with a leaf of pastry, it\u2019s his favorite version of this rice dish, he says. It may be mine, too.\n           \n\n            Kolkata is the source of the batter-fried cauliflower coated in red chile sauce, called lasoni gobi. An example of what happened to Chinese food after it spent a few years in India, lasoni gobi is fun when it\u2019s spicy, and dreary when it\u2019s not. I\u2019ve had it both ways at Sahib. The \u201cchicken 65,\u201d a dish that is much loved on the streets of Chennai, was a little dull here, too.\n           \n\n            Basic staples, though, were unusually good: fragrant lemon rice; thair pachadi, a South Indian raita with mustard seeds and okra; and the dal of black lentils with an uncommonly fresh taste (from ginger, green chiles and cilantro) under the cream and butter.\n           \n\n            Mr. Mathur is both the chef and the owner. He is probably best known\n            \n             for Tulsi\n            \n            , in Midtown, although some New Yorkers still fall into twitchy daydreams at the memory of his menu\n            \n             at Devi\n            \n            . Like those places, and like the restaurants Mr. Natarajan sold to Mr. Mathur, Sahib walks a middle ground between high-gloss operations like\n            \n             Junoon\n            \n            or\n            \n             Indian Accent\n            \n            and the places in the East Village that spent their entire decorating budget on Christmas lights.\n           \n\n            Sahib\u2019s appearance is restrained, with a lot of whitewashed and weathered planks of wood; it looks like some of the nicer beach rentals on VRBO. Service, while overeager at times, avoids both the harried anxiety of cheaper Indian restaurants and the ceremonious pretension of more expensive ones. There is no wine or beer yet, but the waiters always offered to open any bottles we had brought. I stuck with tea or the fine mango lassi, a little tart and very slightly salty.\n           \n\n            More than once when I tried to skip dessert, the servers talked me into gulab jamun, warm globes of cheese and milk dripping with a rose-scented syrup.

As a critic confronted with shiny new restaurants in changing neighborhoods, though, I have to admit that I often end up liking the shiny new places more than what came before.\n           \n\n            So I didn\u2019t waste time worrying about the other Italian restaurants on the south end of Mulberry Street when\n            \n             Pasquale Jones\n            \n            took up residence there in February. Those indistinguishable Little Italy flytraps with their sidewalk hawkers, their holy-communion-ready wines, their lifeless linguine facedown in a shallow pool of clam sauce: They could stand some competition. And the wandering hordes now stand a better chance of tasting New York-style Italian food.\n           \n\n            Pasquale Jones is the second restaurant from the\n            \n             Charlie Bird\n            \n            team, led by the chef Ryan Hardy and two wine scholars, Robert Bohr and Grant Reynolds. The three of them squeeze so many of the prevailing casual New York-Italian tropes into this glass-walled dining room on the corner of Kenmare and Mulberry Streets that it\u2019s virtually a showroom of the genre, circa 2016.\n           \n\n            There is the menu that flits from pasta to pizza to small plates to the inevitable rib-eye for two. (It\u2019s $125. If you try it, tell me how it is.) There is the wine list that roams outside Italy and tries harder than it needs to. And there are wood-burning ovens where most of the food is cooked, which you can see from the tightly organized tables or from a perch at the kitchen counter.\n           \n\n            At Pasquale Jones (as at the French-Italian\n            \n             L\u2019Amico\n            \n            and the California-Italian\n            \n             Upland\n            \n            , among others), pizza is not a single-minded pursuit but a menu category. The crust is crisp and airy, speckled black around the rim. The kitchen didn\u2019t get much mileage out of squash flowers by wilting a few on a bed of mozzarella, with some cherry tomatoes and dribbles of pesto. It sounds like a straight shot of summer breeze, but the flavors didn\u2019t ride along.\n           \n\n            I did have fun with the pizza that had four big white clumps of burrata, one for each tomato-slathered and oregano-seasoned slice. I\u2019d like to thank the server who suggested folding the triangle like a taco, which kept the soft cheese from cascading into my lap.\n           \n\n            One pizza that rises above toppings-on-dough status to cohere into a memorable whole is the clam pie. A little cream extends the flavor of juicy chopped littlenecks marinated in garlic. That could get Pasquale Jones run out of New Haven, but on Mulberry Street, it\u2019s a great idea.\n           \n\n            The pastas are also more sideline than specialty, with just three on the menu most nights. The fresh noodles are particularly good. They keep their firm, egg-dense snap, like the strands of tagliatelle in a soft-spoken rabbit rag\u00f9 or the thin tajarin with corn, cream and a cotton-candy puff of shaved summer truffle.\n           \n\n            Dried spaghetti from\n            \n             the Martelli family\n            \n            \u2019s tiny factory in Tuscany is a constant, too. One night it was dressed with very fine bits of blue crab in a sauce that was so full of vitality I wanted to shoot it into a vein. I could have done it, too, with what was left at the bottom the bowl.\n           \n\n            The inevitable small-plates section is a catchall category for vegetables, seafood and the odd detour into offal (stewed tripe that still has a pleasant, octopus-like bounce in its chile-enhanced tomato sauce, or a breaded and fried ball of head cheese, gooey and alluring). Charcoal-grilled curls of cuttlefish with green tomatoes and mint were impressively meaty and sweet. On another night, squid had stayed on the coals too long, although I enjoyed the wild chickpeas that came with it. They were yellow and flattened, as if somebody had pinched them one at a time.\n           \n\n            A main-course portion of striped bass, though, left the oven at precisely the right time, with all the juicy mild sweetness still under the skin. The plate was minimally adorned with wilted escarole, a few crisp green olives and dabs of olive sauce: a textbook case of knowing when to leave a good piece of fish alone.\n           \n\n            If you\u2019ve heard anything about Pasquale Jones, you have probably been told to order the pork shank for two. That advice is solid. So is the shank itself, a golden knot of meat that shines with melted lardo.\n           \n\n            One dessert a night is the rule. Usually it is fruit that\u2019s been slipped into the wood oven and arranged around a simple ice cream, although one night I happily ate uncooked strawberries and whipped cream. Tiny elderflowers had been strewn on top, and while they didn\u2019t add much flavor, they did provide the momentary suspicion that the kitchen had been taken over by fairies.\n           \n\n            This long and restless menu gives Pasquale Jones a master-of-none quality. Several pizzerias have more finely tuned doughs or dynamic toppings; other kitchens reach much deeper into the pasta canon. There are a lot of little reasons to eat at Pasquale Jones. For big reasons, you have the clam pizza and pork shank, maybe, and the wine. No maybe about the wine.\n           \n\n            Like\n            \n             Charlie Bird\n            \n            , the restaurant has a wine list that is longer than\n            \n             Donald Trump\u2019s speech\n            \n            last week. It starts with a \u201cseasonal short list\u201d of, at last count, about 65 bottles. Then it really gets going. France and Italy dominate, with a few passing glances at other countries. Under the major regions are entire subsections of bottles from producers whose names make wine freaks and big spenders get sweaty and bug-eyed: Raveneau, Tenuta San Guido, Conterno, Coche-Dury, Chave and a little upstart Champagne maker by the name of Dom P\u00e9rignon.\n           \n\n            Who is buying these bottles? At least their prices have the effect of making everything else on the list seem incredibly cheap. I ordered a bottle of what Mr. Reynolds called \u201cthe house Champagne,\u201d a nonvintage brut reserve from B\u00e9r\u00eache et Fils that he recommended with pizza. It costs as much as four pizzas. O.K., not cheap, but reasonable as restaurant Champagne prices go, especially for one this layered and energetic.\n           \n\n            Pasquale Jones is right that bubbles go well with pizza, but it doesn\u2019t have as many affordable options as it could. (The award for best inexpensive sparkling wine selection in a New York pizzeria goes to\n            \n             Marta\n            \n            .) Reds, whites and ros\u00e9s under $65 are easier to find on the short list.\n           \n\n            Whatever you spend, your wine is poured into a crystal glass with a stem as thin as a lollipop stick. They weigh almost nothing, these glasses. Lifting one takes so little effort that the wine arrives at your mouth before you\u2019ve had a chance to think about it. The first time this happens, it\u2019s startling. Then you never want to drink from any other glass.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 15, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/dining/pasquale-jones-review-little-italy.html", "google_mag": 28.899999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n            Medium-rare is how I ordered my tagliata, a grilled sirloin that is, like almost everything else at\n            \n             I Sodi\n            \n            , prepared the way it would be in Tuscany. Right away I changed my mind and asked for it rare. I wanted the sliding smoothness of nearly raw beef.\n           \n\n            The server thought I had it right the first time. \u201cWe cook the steak on the lighter side,\u201d he said. \u201cMedium-rare here is like rare in the rest of America.\u201d\n           \n\n            Although it has been in business on one of Christopher Street\u2019s less rollicking blocks for eight years now, I Sodi seems not to have fully assimilated into the United States. It exists in its own extraterritorial jurisdiction, like the headquarters of the United Nations. To eat there is to abide by the laws of eating that Rita Sodi, the chef and owner, brought with her from the farm north of Florence where she was raised.\n           \n\n            These private laws dictate a menu that is rigidly Tuscan. In\n            \n             its only previous review in The New York Times\n            \n            , an unstarred notice in 2008, Julia Moskin reported that I Sodi offered one risotto, two pastas, three main courses and \u201ca couple of salads.\u201d The menu has grown since then, but it has not wandered into other regions of Italy. And if you are inclined to pop your head into the kitchen to ask for fettuccine Alfredo topped with grilled shrimp, you may want to make sure that Ms. Sodi does not have a knife in her hand.\n           \n\n            The laws also require cooking that is mercilessly yoked to the season. When artichokes are good, they will appear on the menu under antipasti (sliced into a clean and guileless salad of pale, papery shavings that squeak between your teeth, dressed with shards of Parmigiano-Reggiano and a peppery young olive oil); contorni (fried until their young leaves are curled, crisp and bronze); and primi (layered with b\u00e9chamel into a green lasagna, as plump and yielding as a featherbed, with so many thin and tender pasta sheets that I have never been able count them all, though I should say that I am usually preoccupied with eating them).\n           \n\n            Above all, the laws demand that Ms. Sodi dedicate herself so thoroughly to the Tuscan ways of stewing meat sauce, crimping ravioli or squashing Cornish game hens under an iron weight that her own ideas almost completely disappear. She does have ideas, of course. But they do not scream for attention, and neither does she. In her cooking, her ego disappears into her pride in where she comes from.\n           \n\n            This, along with the slightness of her opening menu and some early trial and error, may be why Ms. Sodi waited so long for recognition. A small\n            \n             squall\n            \n            of\n            \n             publicity\n            \n            finally\n            \n             rained\n            \n            down on her in 2014, when she opened\n            \n             Via Carota\n            \n            with the chef Jody Williams. (The two were married last year.) But I Sodi is still known, by the New Yorkers who know it at all, more as a neighborhood beacon than as a chef\u2019s turn in the spotlight.\n           \n\n            The current food scene rewards egotistic gestures of novel techniques or ingredient pairings above rigorous devotion to tradition like Ms. Sodi\u2019s. But there can\u2019t be any doubt that she is one of the city\u2019s great pasta practitioners when you eat I Sodi\u2019s square little chestnut-filled chestnut-flour tortelli in a sauce of butter and grated cheese, or butter-slicked ravioli stuffed with ricotta and spinach under fried sage leaves, or spaghetti cacio e pepe, noodles that twirl up into your mouth with a wiggle, carrying a black-pepper bite that lingers on and on.\n           \n\n            In I Sodi\u2019s kitchen, main ingredients are prohibited from hiding. Chicken is fried inside the thinnest shroud of crust imaginable, one that fuses with the skin into crunch without substance. The baked branzino is sweet, dense, naked except for olive oil; it doesn\u2019t need even a drop of lemon juice. I used to believe that beef tartare needed to be blasted with lightning bolts of salt, mustard and other seasonings until I heaped some of I Sodi\u2019s on a long slice of grilled bread. It tasted like raw beef \u2014 filet mignon in firm pieces the size of a blueberry \u2014 and extra-virgin olive oil. It did not taste salty, although it must contain salt. Salt is allowed to hide.\n           \n\n            Sugar is, too. This makes some desserts more implacable than they should be, like the crostata spread with a layer of orange marmalade so thin that viewed from the side it would disappear. But it\u2019s nice to have the natural sweetness of cream and milk in the panna cotta left mostly alone.\n           \n\n            As for the laws governing customers at I Sodi, they are lenient.\n           \n\n            If you want to eat at one of the eight or so tables that are draped in white cloths, make a reservation. If you want to eat on one of the 16 backless leather seats at the bar, show up early. The dining room is spartan, tight, untheatrical and almost always packed.\n           \n\n            According to some stalkers of Italian flavor, you should stay away from I Sodi\u2019s risotto, for which other regions are better known than Tuscany. Certainly the underseasoned and gummy mushroom risotto I left on my plate recently couldn\u2019t compete with any of Ms. Sodi\u2019s pastas.\n           \n\n            There is no penalty if you don\u2019t drink one of the seven Negroni variations, only rewards if you do. Drinking two, at $13 to $15 each, will be cheaper than a bottle of wine. There are some real treats on the list, many from exactly the region you\u2019d expect, but very few cost less than $70. It is the only aspect of the restaurant that makes me wish Ms. Sodi were more willing to compromise.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 16, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/dining/i-sodi-restaurant-review.html", "google_mag": 15.5}, {"review_text": "\n            The emails from New Delhi began last spring.\n           \n\n            A new one arrived every few months, informing me that a branch of a restaurant in that city named\n            \n             Indian Accent\n            \n            was about to open in Midtown, and urging me to check it out.\n           \n\n            \u201cDear and Most Revered Mr. Pete,\u201d one began. \u201cJust wanted to let you know about the greatest Indian restaurant in the World.\u201d\n           \n\n            Another praised\n            \n             the original location\n            \n            \u2019s kulchas, or stuffed flatbreads, particularly one filled with duck and hoisin. \u201cIt\u2019s as Indian as\n            \n             Padma Lakshmi\n            \n            ,\u201d my correspondent wrote. \u201cBut definitely more delicious.\u201d\n           \n\n            These notes were my first exposure to the cult inspired by\n            \n             Manish Mehrotra\n            \n            . Since opening Indian Accent in a small hotel on the outskirts of New Delhi in 2009, he has become one of the most admired chefs in India. Mr. Mehrotra\u2019s style is lightened by modern influences from abroad (he has trained in other Asian countries and worked in London) but anchored by the culture he grew up in; at his New Delhi restaurant, a scoop of kulfi may be served in a toy pressure cooker, an appliance roughly as common in Indian homes as microwaves are in American ones.\n           \n\n            In India, Mr. Mehrotra\u2019s cooking feeds a desire to see traditional food bent, twisted and played with until it tastes new again. New York could use more of that, too.\n            \n             Junoon\n            \n            and\n            \n             Tamarind Tribeca\n            \n            are on the short list of comfortable, modern Indian restaurants where you can get dressed up for food that looks pretty on the plate. But surprises, ladled out by an active imagination working in an Indian mode, have been scarce since\n            \n             Tabla closed\n            \n            in 2010.\n           \n\n            Indian Accent, which finally opened in February at the foot of\n            \n             Le Parker Meridien Hotel\n            \n            , has surprises. It also has all the comforts of a restaurant where the prix fixe menu offers three courses at $75 (or $90 for four). Except for one gold wall at the far end of the restaurant, the interior stays away from anything that may play into preconceptions of how Indian restaurants are supposed to look.\n           \n\n            At the sharp-edged marble bar, cocktails are infused with tea and spices and made with a care that overcomes goofy names like Transcendental Medication. Tables are set with stiffly pressed napkins and thin-stemmed wineglasses \u2014 a cue to pay attention to Daniel Beedle\u2019s list, which is well stocked with aromatic whites and savory reds that know how to get along with layered spices.\n           \n\n            Mr. Mehrotra shares the title of chef with Vivek Rana, who will eventually take charge of the kitchen. Duck kulcha isn\u2019t on their menu, but the kulcha stuffed with pastrami and mustard helped me see why my New Delhi informants had been so excited.\n           \n\n            \u201cThe chef got the idea for this dish from Peking duck,\u201d our server said as he set down a long wooden tray with a copper pan of shredded lamb at one end, a stack of thin griddled flatbreads called rumali roti in the other, with cucumber spears and four kinds of chutney in the middle. One of those was hoisin sauce subcontinentalized with tamarind, which did bring Peking within shouting distance. But as I folded a roti around some soft spiced lamb and spooned on one chutney or all four \u2014 they were great separately and great together \u2014 I kept thinking about tacos.\n           \n\n            Letting China, Mexico and the Carnegie Deli barge into an Indian restaurant without having the dinner turn into a chaotic grab bag is an impressive feat. And fried squid sprinkled with puffed rice and chickpea-flour threads to turn up the crunch factor? Well, why not, especially when the squid is dusted with a spice blend that could make a tongue depressor taste good.\n           \n\n            I don\u2019t know how to categorize the \u201csweet pickle ribs.\u201d They are not, in fact, pickled, but, in their tart mango sauce with strips of dried mango on top, these tender baby backs are so good I\u2019d eat them under any name.\n           \n\n            The soy keema is a marvelous thing, too. This version is less like the original keema, a stew of ground lamb and peas, than it is like an energetically spiced filling for a vegetarian sloppy Joe. I\u2019m seeing a takeout window with lines outside on 57th Street. It\u2019s possible I got the whole idea from the delicious tiny rolls, perfumed with lime leaves, that accompany the keema on a skewer, looking like marshmallows ready for a campfire.\n           \n\n            Mixed in with the outstanding dishes are some that won\u2019t inspire many international emails. Kolhapuri chicken, a chile-fueled curry from western India, appears as an appetizer of cold chicken salad that you could feed to the least adventurous eater you know. Fried shiso leaves looked impressive standing upright in a pile of potatoes and water chestnuts drizzled with chutney, but the batter was too thick for the herb to have much impact.\n           \n\n            Indian Accent is a young restaurant, still learning to transplant an approach that worked in New Delhi to Manhattan. It can take time for chefs to sort out their suppliers in a new region. Fillets of sea bass glazed with tamarind had a muddy, bottom-feeder taste that we don\u2019t usually seek in wild saltwater fish.\n           \n\n            The menu is less confusing than it was at first, although the crossbreeding of a prix fixe setup with \u00e0 la carte supplements can still be awkward. The lamb, for instance, costs an extra $38. The price is fair enough for a platter that is bigger than many main courses around town, but I wish it didn\u2019t have to be stapled to the already considerable cost of a meal.\n           \n\n            The complexity of deciding what or how to order is one reason servers are prone to waitsplaining. Dinner requires a lot of patient listening and smiling in these early months. True, the menu is paved with terms some New Yorkers will trip over. I was happy to learn that the sweet potato shakarkandi are tender cubes stacked over shaved kohlrabi in one of the best small starters.\n           \n\n            But I\u2019m always impatient to start eating, especially if what\u2019s on the way is a dessert as wonderful as the makhan malai. Traditionally a street snack, here it is a fluffy mound of aerated saffron milk sprinkled with rose petals, almonds and palm sugar.\n           \n\n            The fun of the dessert is in the way these crystallized toppings transform the unsweetened saffron milk once everything meets inside your mouth. It\u2019s the kind of happy collision that few restaurants in town can deliver as well as Indian Accent.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 17, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/25/dining/indian-accent-restaurant-review.html", "google_mag": 25.200000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n            The premodern look in restaurants and bars that has prevailed for the last decade or so is marked by salvaged wood; fireplaces that may or may not function; bare electric bulbs dimmed to mimic gaslight; warrens of small rooms hung with framed lithographs and, sometimes, taxidermy; servers in humorless aprons or lumberjack shirts or both; wine drunk from pickle jars; and short, historically minded cocktails stirred by men who trim their facial hair into antiquated contours.\n           \n\n            The style is distinct from the current Scandinavian aesthetic of twigs and fronds and rocks, but overlaps with it.

Together with Carlos Quirarte, owner of the artfully rustic cafe\n            \n             the Smile\n            \n            , he opened what they call a \u201cFrench new wave\u201d restaurant on the corner of Chrystie and Rivington Streets in December. It goes by the gloriously fake-Gallic name\n            \n             Le Turtle\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            Replacing the artificially genuine with genuine artifice, Le Turtle\u2019s dining room mixes building materials that have nothing in common but their shiny new surfaces.\n           \n\n            Glossy, unchipped marble sits next to raw concrete. Metallic vertical blinds of a kind last seen in \u201cMiami Vice\u201d hang in the front window. Mylar that looks as if it had been taped up five minutes before the doors were unlocked covers one wall. Another is sheeted with unfinished plywood with circles cut out by a jigsaw.\n           \n\n            A third wall is a two-way mirror. Stand behind it, near the restrooms, and you can spy invisibly on the dining room like a security guard at Studio 54. It\u2019s like a private joke that\u2019s funny even though I suspected I didn\u2019t quite entirely get it. I felt the same way about the small table set in a half-hidden nook a few steps above the bar; I couldn\u2019t imagine eating dinner with another adult up there in Rapunzel\u2019s tower.\n           \n\n            I have no idea why the servers wear gray jumpsuits that make them look as if they could change your oil after they refill your water glass. At least I knew that no matter how fashionable the other diners looked, I would never be the worst-dressed person at Le Turtle.\n           \n\n            \u201cWho designed your jumpsuit?\u201d a woman at my table asked our server.\n           \n\n            \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t sound happy. \u201cThey\u2019re very hot now that it\u2019s spring. I hope they give us something else to wear in the summer.\u201d\n           \n\n            \u201cLike rompers?\u201d I asked. He seemed to flinch.\n           \n\n            Sit inside Le Turtle, and you can almost hear a new page in Manhattan dining turning over. \u201cAlmost\u201d because you can\u2019t hear much of anything above the Eurodisco and the\n            \n             Francophone covers of Nancy Sinatra\n            \n            and the Beach Boys.\n           \n\n            The chef, Greg Proechel, who comes to Le Turtle from\n            \n             Blanca\n            \n            and Mr. Nilsson, a short-lived tasting-menu experiment in Long Island City, Queens, seems to have no idea how to translate the French new wave into edible form. Intelligently, he stays away from Godard references; there is no \u00c0 Bout de Souffl\u00e9 au Chocolat. But he also stays away from anything you could really call French cooking.\n           \n\n            He does have an excellent contender in the city\u2019s roast-chicken sweepstakes, a bird that once pecked and strutted in Pennsylvania. To show off its barnyard bona fides, it is initially presented in its entirety, head tucked in and feet stretched out on top of a smoldering nest of hay. The first time one of these platters went by, one of my guests looked up and said, \u201cDo you smell pot?\u201d\n           \n\n            I didn\u2019t taste any smoke in the meat, though I did taste some sugar from the brine. Other than that, Le Turtle\u2019s chicken is great. The skin has the lacquered crackle of Peking duck, and once the bird has been carved, it comes back with all the parts, so you can gnaw on the feet if you wish, though there\u2019s more satisfaction to be had in burrowing into the fatty heart-shaped nugget where the tail feathers were once plugged in.\n           \n\n            Servers will tell you that quantities of this chicken are limited when they recommend it, which they invariably do. This is one restaurant where the dishes suggested by the house tend to be the best things on the menu.\n           \n\n            The poached lobster, for instance, is juicy and well flavored. It was slightly chewy when I had it, but I still liked experimentally pairing it with the mix-and-match accompaniments on the plate, the crunchy tarragon dust, cubes of Asian pear and spicy strips of pickled aj\u00ed amarillo.\n           \n\n            The impressively smooth chicken liver mousse is as good as the servers promise it will be. So is the kohlrabi soup, unlikely as that sounds, served with wonderful cubes of browned lamb bacon. They\u2019re also right about the assortment of mushrooms on a spookily good sauce of brie and oysters; the mushrooms are splattered with black truffle shavings that taste wonderful, even if they do make the dish look like a bowl of potting soil.\n           \n\n            Stray too far from the recommended dishes, though, and you could end up with the peculiarly unappealing seared foie gras with a fluffy, cloying lemon sauce and something that looks and tastes like cornflake crumbs. Leathery rectangles of squid had very little to say to oroblanco, a cousin of grapefruit. And while Mr. Proechel gets some deep flavors out of his braised oxtail, he\u2019s had the meat trimmed into long sections that are interwoven with equally long sections of connective tissue; after awhile, it starts to feel more like dissection than eating.\n           \n\n            The best of the abbreviated dessert menu is the hazelnut financier, busted up into chunks and surrounded with spicy pear pur\u00e9e and yogurt sorbet, among other treats.\n           \n\n            You can drink wine from Burgundy and Bordeaux or from more obscure regions like C\u00f4tes Catalanes on the handy, affordable, single-sheet list. You can\u2019t get a cocktail right now. This will change later this week when the hard-liquor license comes through. At the moment, though, the absence of bitters and the men who obsess over them is another way in which Le Turtle can give you a one-night vacation from all the aspects of New York dining you\u2019re just starting to realize are getting old.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 18, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/dining/le-turtle-restaurant-review.html", "google_mag": 27.0}, {"review_text": "\n            Over the 11 or so weeks\n            \n             Caf\u00e9 Altro Paradiso\n            \n            has been open, I\u2019ve taken some photographs that are as awful as the food is good.\n           \n\n            The restaurant\u2019s carpaccio is simple and marvelous, a single piece of raw bison pounded so thin that when it is laid over small, newly fried potato chips and a mound of arugula salad, it drapes like purple silk. My picture, though, could be a close-up of a skinned knee, or an aerial shot of a dormant volcano made out of flesh.\n           \n\n            One night, a whole turbot was roasted on the bone until its skin neared blackness. Its upturned mouth and fan-shaped tail hung over the edges of a plain white plate. On the side was an off-white gob of mayonnaise in a small white dish, which did nothing to improve my picture but did taste very good on the edge of a forkful of sweet, slightly sticky fish.\n           \n\n            If you added a sprig of curly parsley, the restaurant\u2019s lamb chop could come from a 1950s supper club. A meat with two sides, it\u2019s barely photographable, and I\u2019d eat it again in a minute. First, I\u2019d go after the white shell beans cooked to the brink of collapse. Then I\u2019d take a strip of Calabrian chile with a forkful of the chop. I might skip the slices of roasted shoulder on the side of the plate \u2014 a little tough \u2014 but not the thin curve of meat and fat that, left on the outside edge of the bone, crisped up like bacon. I\u2019d save it for last, like an after-dinner chocolate.\n           \n\n            This can\u2019t be an accident, the inverse relation between prettiness and deliciousness at Caf\u00e9 Altro Paradiso. The kitchen \u2014 Aidan O\u2019Neal is the chef de cuisine under the direction of Ignacio Mattos, the chef and an owner \u2014 seems to be trying to strip food down to the bare elements of flavor. Dressing it up again would be like tacking vinyl siding to the concrete front of\n            \n             the Met Breuer\n            \n            , where Mr. Mattos plans to open a restaurant this year.\n           \n\n            Refusing to decorate its plates doesn\u2019t seem to have hurt business. There\u2019s been a steady flow of curious diners who know or know of Mr. Mattos\u2019s first restaurant,\n            \n             Estela\n            \n            . His partner in both is Thomas Carter, a front-of-house specialist with a concentration in wine.\n           \n\n            Neither man was especially well known when\n            \n             Estela opened\n            \n            in a low-ceilinged and stubbornly noisy space a few steps above Houston Street, but Mr. Mattos had an instinct for cooking that was direct and idiosyncratic without seeming forced, and Mr. Carter put together a list so full of accessible discoveries that Estela could be seen as an unofficial wine bar.\n           \n\n            The place quickly achieved cult status. (After President Obama\n            \n             took his wife there for a dinner date\n            \n            in 2014, the cult went global.)\n           \n\n            For\n            \n             their second act\n            \n            , Mr. Mattos and Mr. Carter seem to have fantasized on the theme of a simple Italian cafe. Servers at Caf\u00e9 Altro Paradiso wear proletarian button-up jackets of navy blue cotton as they carry amaro and tiramis\u00f9 on silver trays to the bare wood tables.\n           \n\n            The high ceilings and the vast windows facing the peeling trunks of plane trees in a cobblestoned SoHo park suggest that eventually the dining room will be a fine place to enjoy a tranquil and possibly solitary breakfast or lunch. Only dinner is served now, and it\u2019s far from tranquil, although the partners have clearly learned a thing or two about acoustic panels since they opened Estela.\n           \n\n            The greater comfort of this casual spinoff is a paradox, though not one anybody is going to complain about. A second paradox deserves a moment\u2019s pause, though. In keeping with the small-plates regimen followed at Estela, most of the portions at Caf\u00e9 Altro Paradiso are deliberately small. Servers make a point of telling you that the pasta is not the size of a main course.\n           \n\n            This could be a problem for people who walk in under the impression that they are in a normal Italian cafe. Say you were in the mood to sit at the bar with a glass of Lugana from\n            \n             C\u00e1 Lojera\n            \n            , a Lombardian white with fresh tropical-fruit overtones, eating ramp pesto over very flavorful whole-grain spaghetti for dinner. Would you be delighted to find that you could transfer all the spaghetti in your bowl into one cupped hand?\n           \n\n            But for now, just play the kitchen\u2019s game and schedule pasta as a midmeal diversion. Eat the slow-cooked chicken rag\u00f9 brightened with briny green olives and tossed with skinny, chewy tubes of garganelli and you should be happy. Have the near-transparent sheets of cannelloni rolled up around a light, unsoggy filling of ricotta flecked with greens, and you should be even happier.\n           \n\n            Before pasta, there is grilled bread with cut-up anchovies, chile oil and parsley on a bed of butter; or pale fennel shavings with orange zest and soft curls of good provolone; or a pink and juicy Italian sausage with fruity mustard and chopped broccoli rabe; or the carpaccio. All of it sounds ordinary but is far from it.\n           \n\n            After pasta, you might investigate that supper-club lamb chop, or the polenta and stewed onions under a lobe of calf\u2019s liver, so creamy inside it\u2019s like a pink organ-meat custard.\n           \n\n            I\u2019d sidestep the thickish pork Milanese, no thrill especially when served with unsalted peas and favas. Sometimes Mr. O\u2019Neal and Mr. Mattos manage to push simplicity in directions that seem novel. Other times, they don\u2019t push quite hard enough, and it\u2019s hard to tell Caf\u00e9 Altro Paradiso apart from the hordes of other restaurants where you can have cheese and salami followed by a so-so pork cutlet.\n           \n\n            Like the portion sizes, the interestingness quotient may need fine-tuning as the restaurant grows up. This seems well within the grasp of Mr. O\u2019Neal, who in his last job, running the kitchen at\n            \n             M. Wells Dinette\n            \n            , helped bundles of spaghetti transition into sandwich form, among other exercises in the art of channeling chaos. And it should be old hat for Mr. Mattos, whose cooking at\n            \n             Isa\n            \n            a few years back was at times interesting to a fault.\n           \n\n            One very encouraging sign is how perceptively the pastry kitchen has located the sensuous side in some traditional Italian-cafe sweets. The dark and bittersweet chocolate-walnut torta is intense without congealing into fudge, and the rhubarb crostata has a crust that\u2019s a pleasure on its own.\n           \n\n            Even the gelato is a nice surprise. There\u2019s a rich and unusual one with honey and chestnuts, and another with dried figs and vin santo. It reminds me of the classic French ice cream made from prunes and Armagnac, but without the booze on its breath.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 19, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/dining/cafe-altro-paradiso-review.html", "google_mag": 28.5}, {"review_text": "\n            When all of the little plates of pickles and vegetables and whatnot land on the table at the start of a Korean meal, it\u2019s like winning a game show. They are called banchan, and they shower down out of nowhere, like balloons. Fermented daikon and wavy cabbage leaves, pink with chile paste. Pinwheels of soy-stained lotus root. Silvery, crunchy stir-fried anchovies no bigger than paper matches.\n           \n\n            If I\u2019m in a restaurant, I pay close attention to these dishes. The better they are, the higher my hopes for the rest of the meal. They serve as a quick reminder from the outset of how varied Korean cuisine can be, how it can pack both nuance and power. And, of course, I like them because at most Korean restaurants they\u2019re free.\n           \n\n            It was my strong feelings about banchan that made me suspicious when I first heard that a new restaurant called\n            \n             Atoboy\n            \n            had made them the foundation of its menu. What could this be but another ploy to charge us for something that used to come with the cost of the meal? We\u2019ve lost the battle over bread. I was ready to draw a line in the sand over banchan.\n           \n\n            After three dinners at Atoboy (ah-TOE-boy) since last fall and one quick snack at the bar, I\u2019m happy to admit that I was wrong. This is no scam. Junghyun Park, the chef, uses banchan as a starting point, then goes on to build smart, surprising dishes around it.\n           \n\n            Look at what he does with those pinwheels of lotus root, laying them over a bed of tofu in soft, tiny curds like ricotta. It\u2019s a great dish, half crunchy and half creamy, both halves humming along under a dressing of chile oil and sesame oil.\n           \n\n            Fans of the barbecue at\n            \n             Kang Ho Dang Baekjeong\n            \n            will remember the pan of corn in melted cheese that sits at the edge of the domed grill and is basted by the hot drippings that slide down from the sizzling meat. Mr. Park has a wonderful take on this, using bacon for its fat and taleggio for its tang, mixing in the fermented soybean paste called doenjang to make everything more intense. When a bowl of it showed up, it got side-eyes at my table. Corn out of season? Nobody who tasted it stayed skeptical.\n           \n\n            Mr. Park, 32, was raised in Seoul. Bypassing culinary school, he went on a grand tour and learned to cook at restaurants in England and Australia. At the end, he returned to his hometown to work in the kitchen at Jungsik, a westernized Korean restaurant with global aspirations. When\n            \n             Jungsik\n            \n            set up an outpost in Lower Manhattan, Mr. Park was dispatched to serve as its chef de cuisine.\n           \n\n            Finally ready to go out on his own, he opened Atoboy on East 28th Street last summer with his wife, Ellia, a veteran of the dining rooms at\n            \n             Noreetuh\n            \n            and\n            \n             Maialino\n            \n            . She manages the restaurant.\n           \n\n            Like Jungsik, Atoboy favors the subtler end of the Korean flavor spectrum, but it avoids fussing and tweezing. Mr. Park\u2019s novel and lovely sea bass tartare, under a shimmering pale-green layer of chopped kiwi, mint and fermented spring garlic, could easily slide onto the menu at Jungsik if he decked out the plate with some foofaraw. (I\u2019m glad he doesn\u2019t.)\n           \n\n            The low-key atmosphere that the Parks have set down, though, has little in common with the carpeted environs of Jungsik, which affects a formality so stiff around the spine that the servers might be wearing back braces. Atoboy is also a deliberate step away from the controlled chaos of the Korean restaurants a few blocks north on 32nd Street. Between its patched walls of raw concrete, simple wooden tables are arranged in two symmetrical rows with a narrow path to the kitchen down the middle.\n           \n\n            It looks like a downtown wine bar, and in fact wine is one of the chief attractions. The list is brief but manages to take you to places you wouldn\u2019t expect to visit in a Korean restaurant. There\u2019s a concentration of bottles from Nikolaihof, Gut Oggau and other fine Austrian producers; a small flock of Loire winemakers such as Olga Raffault; Champagnes from Charles Ellner and other independent labels; and some respected West Coast names like Pedroncelli and Dirty & Rowdy. Everything I\u2019ve tried has cohabited amicably with Mr. Park\u2019s food.\n           \n\n            Although all 18 dishes on the menu can be ordered on their own, servers suggest a $36 meal made of one from each of three categories \u2014 roughly, cold salads, warm appetizers and plates where seafood or meat do most of the work. They\u2019re served more or less in that order but without pauses between the courses, and the plates pile up in the middle of the table.\n           \n\n            This makes it too easy for nuanced dishes, like fried and braised sunchokes with oyster mushrooms and oranges dressed in a creamy truffle emulsion, to get lost. The servers insist that everything is meant for sharing. Heard that one before? But some dishes, like the delicate egg custard in a smoky dashi with morels and soybeans, were worse for wear and tear after they were doled out to individual plates.\n           \n\n            It\u2019s almost impossible to get worked up about any of this, though, because the $36 menu is such a fair deal, and because so many of the dishes work so well and do things you didn\u2019t know Korean food could do.\n           \n\n            Mr. Park\u2019s take on yuk hwe is memorable, the beef tartare cut into long skinny threads that are tossed with soy sauce, dotted with nettle cream and topped with what seem to be julienne potato chips. Braised mackerel, usually cooked in soy sauce, is simmered in a complex green-chile broth. Little drums of octopus leg, a dot of parsley oil in the center of each one, are ringed around a kind of hash of kimchi and chorizo \u2014 two things that were meant to be together, though I never would have guessed.\n           \n\n            After these shifting, swirling flavors, the desserts have a clarifying effect. The ginger panna cotta with pink grapefruit is just as refreshing as it sounds.

Before that happens, you choose one of the eight or so main courses pictured on the wall, give your order to an extroverted host who taps it into a hand-held screen, and mill around the silverware and condiment station until you hear your name and are handed your meal on a charcoal-colored tray that doubles as a place mat.\n           \n\n            This routine may sound familiar and indeed it is, being the basic model of fast-casual restaurants from\n            \n             Shake Shack\n            \n            on down. Made Nice has nipped and tucked the formula all around, but the biggest difference is what\u2019s on the tray. It\u2019s not a burger or a grain bowl but a multicolored, photogenic and meticulously arranged plate that bears at least a familial resemblance to the cooking at\n            \n             Eleven Madison Park\n            \n            and\n            \n             the NoMad\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            Like those two restaurants, Made Nice is under the ownership and direction of the chef Daniel Humm and his collaborator, Will Guidara. To bring some of their usual meticulous care and a few glimmers of their artistry to a high-speed operation is the trick Made Nice is trying to pull off. To do so, the two owners have requisitioned a sous-chef from Eleven Madison Park, Danny DiStefano, to run the enormous kitchen, while Mr. Humm waves his magic wand somewhere offstage.\n           \n\n            As trays loaded with salad-like dishes leave the counter, you can glimpse bits and pieces of the two more formal restaurants flying by, like the scraps of Kansas that Dorothy sees caught in the twister. Look \u2014 it\u2019s the NoMad chicken! And isn\u2019t that the pork confit from Eleven Madison Park?\n           \n\n            Well, no, not really, as you will discover when you sit down and eat. The Made Nice confit doesn\u2019t have the creaminess or the concentrated delicacy that suckling pig gives the original, or the golden roof of crisp skin. It\u2019s a dark brick of shredded pork, a heavy-tasting and oddly inert centerpiece for a summer salad of shaved corn, watercress and wheat berries.\n           \n\n            Served at night and on Saturdays, the chicken is the only major dish at Made Nice that could not even by the most elastic definition be called a salad. With a bread stuffing under its browned skin, it does resemble the NoMad chicken from a distance.\n           \n\n            But\n            \n             the one at NoMad\n            \n            tastes as if it comes from some lost island where the gene that controls delicious chicken flavor has been passed down intact for centuries. The Made Nice chicken, by contrast, is ordinary \u2014 moist without being juicy, as if all its flavor had leaked out of the meat in order to make the stuffing as gummy as possible. The price is $22 for half a chicken and skinny fries. The fries are very good.\n           \n\n            Nobody should be surprised when a stripped-down dish that can be ready in five minutes and costs, on average, about $14 isn\u2019t as wonderful as one that was fluffed to greatness for its role in a $295 tasting menu. It\u2019s not a fair fight, yet it\u2019s one that Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidara have invited by trying to link their fast-casual business with their other restaurants.\n           \n\n            But some of the food at Made Nice doesn\u2019t just suffer by comparison; it can also suffer all on its own.\n           \n\n            The curried cauliflower is said to be a callout to another standby at the NoMad. I don\u2019t remember trying it there, so I can\u2019t say whether it\u2019s so unevenly cooked that some pieces are brown and collapsed while others are white, crunchy and barely cooked. That\u2019s how the cauliflower at Made Nice was, though. It tasted nothing like a real curry, and only a little bit like curry powder.\n           \n\n            Another dish is called chicken rice. The rice tastes like tomatoes and needs salt. The chicken seems exhausted. Imagine a chain of Cuban restaurants started by retired employees of the Olive Garden. This could be their arroz con pollo.\n           \n\n            Of the nine major dishes on the current menu, there are three I would be happy to eat again. One is a salad of watermelon and quinoa that has just enough twists and turns to stand out, like crisp pistachios and soft, creamy feta. Another, seared hanger steak slices over roasted broccoli that is chopped and seasoned with lime, may not sound like a winning combination, but it is. A third is smoked salmon salad whose croutons are, in fact, little fried cubes of shredded potato.\n           \n\n            Actually, there is a fourth dish worth revisiting, though I wouldn\u2019t try to make a meal of it: the milk and honey sundae. The ice cream is soft serve \u2014 milk, uncontaminated by vanilla \u2014 strewn with a variety of fun, crunchy bits made from milk or honey. It\u2019s $6.\n           \n\n            The sundae combines sophistication and pleasure better than anything else on the menu. It is also the only item you can\u2019t get delivered. I suspect these things may be related.\n           \n\n            That enormous kitchen wasn\u2019t built solely to feed the 30 or so people who can be seated in the restaurant. It was designed to handle a tall pile of takeout and delivery orders. So, in fact, were the recipes. Aside from the sundae, everything is engineered to look and taste almost as good after being sealed with a plastic lid, packed into a bag and carted 10 blocks.\n           \n\n            The explosion of delivery services has entranced chefs of all sorts. New York restaurants that would have hung up on you 10 years ago if you\u2019d called for a delivery order \u2014\n            \n             Mission Chinese Food\n            \n            ,\n            \n             Hearth\n            \n            ,\n            \n             DB Bistro Moderne\n            \n            ,\n            \n             Santina\n            \n            , most of the\n            \n             Momofukus\n            \n            \u2014 are now, like Made Nice, signed up with\n            \n             Caviar\n            \n            .

Meanwhile, restaurants across the country are anxiously watching as foot traffic falls at lunch and dinner.\n           \n\n            These twin trends have created a new and nearly invisible kind of restaurant with no dining room, just a commissary kitchen that fulfills orders to go. They\u2019re called ghost restaurants. Made Nice seems to be something different. Its small dining room is merely the tip of a much bigger operation lurking below the surface. It\u2019s an iceberg restaurant.\n           \n\n            To test it out, I ate one of my three Made Nice meals at The New York Times Building. My order showed up about a minute late, which counts as early given Midtown rush-hour traffic, and was pretty much as advertised. The fried chicken skins that are supposed to be scattered over the gravy-like chicken velout\u00e9 didn\u2019t show up, and a caper-dill relish that the menu said came with the tuna ni\u00e7oise was smeared on the pork confit and the cod Proven\u00e7al as well.\n           \n\n            Nothing was hot after about 30 minutes in transit. But the cooked items were still warm, the lettuce and other raw ingredients hadn\u2019t wilted, and all the plates looked as if they had been primped by a food stylist for an overhead shot. Eating food like this at your desk would not feel like a complete surrender.\n           \n\n            Eating it in a restaurant is another story. Whether the same recipes can suit both experiences is the question Made Nice asks. Your own answer will depend on whether you are hoping for food that is quick, inexpensive and as delicious as you would expect from one of the city\u2019s best-known chefs, or are willing to settle for two out of three.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 21, "rating": "Satisfactory", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/dining/made-nice-restaurant-review.html", "google_mag": 37.29999923706055}, {"review_text": "\n\n          WE HAD BEEN DRIVING\n         \n         less than 10 minutes from the toll plaza on the Staten Island side of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge when we spotted the elephants.\n        \n\n         Draped with bright red and yellow carpets, their trunks raised importantly, the animals marched with a retinue of turbaned drummers and attendants across a nearly life-size mural that covered the first floor of a building.\n        \n\n         \u201cI think we\u2019ve found it,\u201d I said.\n        \n\n         Our destination was Lakruwana, one of about a half-dozen Sri Lankan restaurants on Staten Island. Some of these are a short walk from the ferry terminal in St. George, on a hilltop along Victory Boulevard where they are huddled with groceries selling banana blossoms, coconut vinegar, wood apple juice and ribbon cake.\n        \n\n         A mile or so south, about 10 minutes from the ferry by bus or Staten Island Railway, is Lakruwana. It stands alone, in more than one way. While the atmosphere of the island\u2019s other Sri Lankan restaurants ranges from serviceable to pleasant, Lakruwana\u2019s verges on spectacular.\n        \n\n         The elephants gave us a hint of what we were in for, but things didn\u2019t really get going until we stepped inside. The walls were covered with small, rough pink stones set in stucco framed by bamboo rods. There was a brightly painted wood door in one wall, flanked by matching wood shutters, and above them began the eaves of a tin roof. It was as if we had walked into a small house in the Sri Lankan countryside that had been turned inside out.\n        \n\n         All around the room were painted masks, sharp pairs of spears, statues of Buddha, and who knows what else. The backs of the chairs were metal rods that stretched about five feet into the air before tapering off into curlicues that looked like butterfly antennas drawn by Dr. Seuss.\n        \n\n         We\u2019d come on a Sunday, when a buffet is served all day. If we had expected a dour stainless-steel steam table, we had come to the wrong restaurant. All the curries, rice and other dishes were waiting for us inside 20 or so covered clay pots set over flames.\n        \n\n         Lifting the lids, I found deviled chicken in a chile sauce with a balance of sweetness and spice that grew more captivating the more I ate; sticks of pineapple in a lightly hot curry paste soured with tamarind; chopped kale mixed with coconut and stir fried just until the greens begin to relax, a wonderful thing to do to kale; fat yellow lentils stewed in coconut milk with the warming flavors of mustard seeds, curry leaves and cinnamon sticks.\n        \n\n         A mysterious shiny black tangle turned out to be eggplant that had been cooked and cooked, and cooked some more, until it was nearly marmalade. I kept returning for another taste. One or two dishes were easier to resist, like pork in a murky green-black sauce or hard-cooked eggs in an extremely mild coconut-milk curry. But there was always something else to discover, especially the condiments: a flaky pink coconut sambal; another sambal of marinated onions; and lunu miris, a chile-onion relish that I used to give a screaming heat to other things on the plate when I wasn\u2019t eating it straight up.\n        \n\n         It was Lakruwana\u2019s lunu miris that made me take up silverware again after trying to follow the advice painted on the mirror above a small sink by the kitchen door: \u201cSri Lankan Foods Would Be More Tastier If You Use Your Fingers Than The Forks.\u201d Though the curries did seem more flavorful when I ate them with my hands, I had trouble keeping a grip on the lentils.\n        \n\n         This is the cooking that Lakruwana\u2019s chef, Jayantha Wijesinghe, learned in her mother\u2019s kitchen in Sri Lanka. After moving to the United States, she married another Sri Lankan expatriate, Lakruwana Wijesinghe, and together they opened what was almost certainly New York\u2019s first Sri Lankan restaurant. It was unlicensed, and consisted of a picnic table under an umbrella behind a grocery shop in a sixth-floor walk-up above a pornographic movie theater in Times Square. In 1995, it moved to the\n         \n          street level\n         \n         and went legit.\n        \n\n         After a fire, Lakruwana relocated to Staten Island, where an estimated 5,000 Sri Lankans have settled over the past few decades. Before it moved into its current spot in Stapleton about two years ago, Mr. Wijesinghe went to Sri Lanka, designed the dining room, bought all the materials and decorations and sent them to New York City in a 40-foot shipping container. Lifting each of the bamboo-and-stone wall panels, he said, required six men.\n        \n\n         I know of no other place in town that goes quite so far to summon up the world where its owners were born. Lakruwana may be New York\u2019s most elaborate realization of the immigrant restaurateur\u2019s dream: a shrine to another culture that can soothe homesickness in some patrons and kindle a thrilling sense of discovery in others.\n        \n\n         For both kinds of customers, Ms. Wijesinghe\u2019s menu, executed by A. Wimalaratha, is a showcase of distinctively Sri Lankan dishes. Her excellent version of mulligatawny soup, green with cilantro and sour with lemon juice, tilts more toward Southeast Asia than India. Her kitchen also makes lampreis, a steamed packet of aromatic long-grained rice, curry, eggplant, onions, bananas, soft cashews and a fried egg wrapped in a banana leaf that is pinned shut with a paper umbrella.\n        \n\n         A batter of coconut and rice flour is fried into a wafer and shaped while still warm into crisp, edible bowls called hoppers. You eat them with one of the curries, like the nuanced, gingery Ceylon chicken, or the Wadiya squid seasoned with toasted coriander and cumin. (Both were better choices than the kingfish curry or tuna ambul thiyal, which suffered from lackluster seafood.)\n        \n\n         Threads of rice flour called string hoppers are sizzled with vegetables and curry and the result, a string hopper kottu, is something like a Southeast Asian stir-fried noodle. The kottu roti is a near cousin in which thin strands of sliced roti stand in for the rice-flour threads. Both are wonderful, particularly if you convince Mr. Wijesinghe, who waits tables in a sarong, that you can handle some spice. (This is crucial with the deviled dishes, which are otherwise dull.)\n        \n\n         After the savory courses, desserts offer a welcome simplicity. There is yogurt under a dark sea of honey, and there is a mango pudding that I look forward to tasting again.\n        \n\n         Strange as it sounds, I look forward to the water, too. It is served in clay cups with glazed lips, which somehow makes it taste cooler and smoother. I\u2019m sure the restaurant goes through a lot of these. But having imported enough Sri Lankan rocks to cover the walls, the Wijesinghes must view the cost of replacing a few broken cups as a trivial expense.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 22, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-lakruwana-on-staten-island.html", "google_mag": 19.899999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n            The Islands\n            \n             used to be a two-story restaurant\n            \n            on the Crown Heights side of Washington Avenue in Brooklyn, near the top of the hill, within sight of the Brooklyn Museum. Upstairs was a cramped, angular, shadowy dining room with a few tables under a ceiling so low it made tall people stoop. Downstairs was a cramped, angular, shadowy kitchen where oxtails, goat curry and other Jamaican dishes were cooked and sold.\n           \n\n            To the right of the door, behind a counter, was the restaurant\u2019s single stove. It had three burners that were almost always going. No matter when I went there it seemed that about a quarter of the things on the menu had not finished cooking, but complaining would have been cloddish, both because the limitations on capacity were obvious and because whatever was finished was bound to be both nuanced and powerful.\n           \n\n            The whole operation was one of those precarious marvels of adaptive survival, like a pine growing from a crack in the side of a cliff. So the outlook was grim when news came two summers ago that the structures housing the Islands and another business were being torn down so a new apartment building could be constructed. This neighborhood and the ones to the south between Flatbush and Ralph Avenues owe much of their character to black- and immigrant-owned businesses, including a large swath of Caribbean restaurants such as the Islands. With developers sniffing at this part of Brooklyn, many of them are at risk.\n           \n\n            Marilyn Reid, who owns the Islands with Shuon Letchford, had other ideas. She had had other ideas since 2001, when she opened the restaurant. \u201cWe were always looking because we had outgrown it by the second day,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cWe knew.\u201d\n           \n\n            Before closing the original space in March 2017, she and Ms. Letchford had found a much bigger one downhill on Washington Avenue. Preparing it took a few months more than she had hoped, but the second incarnation of the Islands has been up and running since January.\n           \n\n            The new kitchen has two stoves and 10 burners. Nevertheless, what\u2019s available when I\u2019ve gone has always been several dishes shy of the complete menu. The stewed okra with cod is especially hard to pin down. At the same time, the comfort of the bigger dining room and the table service, an impossibility in the first space, have encouraged me to branch out beyond my usual favorites.\n           \n\n            The Islands is best known for long-simmered stews but the kitchen also knows a thing or two about frying. The flattened fritters of salt cod seasoned with fresh hot chiles, known as stamp and go, were crunchy and golden. Some Caribbean cooks deep-fry fish escovitch to oblivion, on the theory that spicy vinegar heals all wounds. The escovitch I had at the Islands was a whole red snapper, obviously fresh and fried just until firm. The vinegar dressing, meanwhile, was seasoned with not just hot chiles but pickled bell peppers, carrots and cucumbers, making this escovitch more interesting than usual.\n           \n\n            From the old days, I knew the curried goat would be very tender and richly seasoned, although like most of the cooking at the Islands, it was never scalp-piercingly spicy. Now I\u2019ve found a new standby in the curried vegetables \u2014 a very different thing, of course, but the golden raisins, turmeric and allspice may do even more for cabbage and carrots than they do for goat meat.\n           \n\n            Barbecue chicken was ordered in a rush verging on panic because whatever I\u2019d first wanted wasn\u2019t ready yet. The sauce is nothing like the ketchup-based sludge I\u2019d imagined. Made with raisins and allspice, it tastes more like a glaze for a holiday ham, and it\u2019s lovely.\n           \n\n            I prefer it to the jerk chicken, which will sound like heresy to some customers. Like barbecue, jerk can describe either a sauce or a process, and the process needs to involve wood smoke. The Islands bakes its jerk chicken in the oven, and while I like its sauce, when I want jerk chicken I will cross Eastern Parkway and keep the windows down until I smell burning allspice logs.\n           \n\n            But I have no quarrel with the jerk shrimp or leg of lamb at the Islands \u2014 there\u2019s no place to get an allspice-smoked version of either, as far as I know. The lamb is especially alluring, stuffed with jerk spices and slowly roasted until its outer crust falls, upon slicing, into a dark rubble that in New Orleans would be called debris.\n           \n\n            Rice and peas, fried plantains and stewed cabbage, slippery with coconut oil, are all mandatory in my book. Others insist on baked macaroni and cheese, served in a brick the size of a pound of butter. When I taste the bread crumbs on top, and wonder if they\u2019ve been seasoned with dried onions, I think those people may have a point.\n           \n\n            All of this food is brought to the table on oval platters that could hold a small Thanksgiving turkey.\n           \n\n            Since opening in January, the new dining room has been embellished bit by bit. The walls are painted in watermelon and aquamarine. Small hurricane lamps decorate the tables. A couple of weeks ago, plaid cloth napkins made their debut in the middle of dinner service. Menus, which used to be kept inside a clear plastic sheath, are now presented inside folders made of textured handmade paper, held in place with stickers of bumblebees and butterflies.\n           \n\n            The bar, across the dining room from the kitchen, is still unoccupied while Ms. Reid waits for a liquor license to come through. A rumored roof deck has not materialized, either. In the meantime there is an excellent limeade sweetened with demerara sugar and a dark purple, fruity sorrel punch, which can give the impression it has been lightly spiked with rum.\n           \n\n            Credit for the food at the Islands is shared. There are two chefs, Delroy Henry and Ronald Porter. Most of the recipes, though, are Ms. Letchford\u2019s, and she does a lot of the cooking. Like Ms. Reid, all of them were raised in Jamaica before moving to New York, but only Ms. Letchford did any professional cooking there. Ms. Reid is often in the kitchen too. \u201cI do the light stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cI tend to stay with salads, seafood.\u201d\n           \n\n            Is the food as good as before? I used to be impressed that anything at all could be cooked at the old Islands. That so much of it was actively delicious seemed like a miracle. It\u2019s less astonishing now that the kitchen has 10 burners and room to turn around.\n           \n\n            But I suspect the only thing that\u2019s changed is me. And when I\u2019m in the mood for something miraculous, I\u2019ll just remind myself that the Islands is still in business. You can\u2019t stop gentrification, but sometimes you can fool it while it\u2019s looking the other way.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 25, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/dining/the-islands-review.html", "google_mag": 26.700000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n         Wylie Dufresne is probably called a mad scientist more often than any other American chef, but nobody ever says what kind of mad scientist he is.\n        \n\n         The obvious answer is that he\u2019s a mad chemist, weighing out colloids and starches and sugars by the gram. That\u2019s what has helped him win international acclaim at\n         \n          WD-50\n         \n         . And so far, that\u2019s how people have seen the menu at\n         \n          Alder\n         \n         , his new, more casual place in the East Village where you can build a meal out of three to five smallish plates, or just check into the bar with a slightly twisted Cheddar spread and a fully twisted mai tai.\n        \n\n         Of course, there\u2019s also a case that Mr. Dufresne is a mad zoologist. With an enzyme known in the trade as meat glue, he creates such unnatural species as the cylindrical quail. This boneless, beakless pink column of poultry doesn\u2019t cluck or walk. Its sole purpose is to be deep-fried in panko in Alder\u2019s kitchen and stretched out across ripe bananas and broccoli leaves in a sweet and easygoing curry. Sliced, it looks like a cross section of an unpeeled red banana, suggesting that maybe Mr. Dufresne is a mad botanist, too.\n        \n\n         Or a mad marine biologist. Alder\u2019s excellent fish and chips is made from spiny dogfish, which looks like a small, dimwitted shark who\u2019s lost his dentures. As any ocean scientist knows, though, it is one of the region\u2019s most abundant edible saltwater fish, with fine-grained and mild white flesh that fries up beautifully. As only a mad ocean scientist knows, fried dogfish is even better with powdered malt vinegar, which solves the problem of soggy fish and chips that plagues New Englanders and Britons.\n        \n\n         But if you ask me, these are all hobbies that Mr. Dufresne picked up while pursuing his true vocation as mad neurologist. He and his colleagues at Alder (Jon Bignelli is the executive chef, leading an intensely collaborative kitchen with heavy input from Mr. Dufresne) get into your brain and rewire its pathways until you find yourself looking at one thing and tasting something else. They are like\n         \n          Oliver Sacks\n         \n         in reverse.\n        \n\n         Some of the madness and a fair amount of the neurology can be traced back to Mr. Dufresne\u2019s early encounter with Ferran Adri\u00e0\u2019s mock olives and the like at\n         \n          El Bulli\n         \n         , in Spain. People tended to focus on the chemicals and laboratory equipment in Mr. Adri\u00e0\u2019s kitchen, a shame because he mainly used those things so that his cooking could make us see the world differently.\n        \n\n         At Alder, you will probably not mistake your wife for a hat, but you may mistake your rye pasta for a sandwich. This is a nice, normal plate of fettuccine, except that it tastes exactly like a Katz\u2019s pastrami on rye with mustard. They can\u2019t be right, these signals your neurons are firing off. But they are, and the noodle sandwich is a lot of fun to eat, right down to the shaved pastrami jerky, chopped pickled green tomatoes and mustard sauce.\n        \n\n         You won\u2019t mistake the clam chowder in a red enamel camping mug for anything but clam chowder. Very little about the soup of smoked bacon, cream and shellfish would be out of place in Hyannis or Kennebunkport, although this version is more seductively smooth than usual. The oyster crackers, though, may cause some cognitive dissonance. After the first crunch, they dissolve, leaving nothing but a ghostly flicker of oyster flavor on your tongue.\n        \n\n         Sometimes all the mad neurologists at Alder need to do is hit you with an ingredient you weren\u2019t expecting. The ricotta next to beets pickled in rice vinegar isn\u2019t ricotta at all but crumbled coconut milk gel. The flavor is wonderfully refreshing, especially when you eat it with the green shards that taste of tender, minty Thai basil.\n        \n\n         Did that bite of foie gras terrine, topped with a shiso leaf and a semicircle of yuzu-infused watermelon, really sit on a Ritz? Yes. Yes it did, and it was delightful beyond all reason.\n         \n          Good cracker\n         \n         . Great snack.\n        \n\n         True, there are moments when you wonder if your synapses are experiencing side effects. Slabs of raw yellowtail were overwhelmed by Parmesan-dressed leaves of romaine; the dish, called Caesar salad nigiri, seemed to call for an oilier, more forceful fish, like the mackerel that is sometimes on the menu. I was fascinated by the banana curry, but wished the quail had been juicier and the breading crisper. Fresh cherries in a disassembled cheesecake tasted like a manhattan, which was the intended effect, but the waxy lumps of cake brought to mind only cheese-scented candles.\n        \n\n         I\u2019ve had at least one dish I could not unravel each time I\u2019ve eaten at WD-50, but the next thing I tasted would bring redemptive manipulations of flavor, texture, temperature and shape. At Alder, redemption often takes a simpler form. After the nigiri, you can lean back and smile as you eat airy scrambled eggs with smoked trout and skinny twigs of grilled asparagus. You can have octopus that\u2019s just chewy enough with an unexpectedly charming pesto of watercress and cashews.\n        \n\n         Mr. Dufresne hasn\u2019t put this many relaxed and accessible dishes on a menu since he left\n         \n          71 Clinton Fresh Food\n         \n         in 2002. The dining room isn\u2019t intimidating, either. It even dabbles in a bit of downtown farm-to-table clich\u00e9, with slats of weathered wood salvaged from an old fence. Not everything is rustic, though: note the black rubber tops on the tables and the elastic bands stretched around the water carafes like dog collars. Green is for filtered, carbonated tap; white means straight from the faucet.\n        \n\n         The angle of those slats looks as if they would blunt noise. This is an illusion. The conversational racket is ferocious when Alder is full, which it almost always is these days. If you are losing both hearing and eyesight, the restaurant will be a double ordeal, because the type on the menu is pill-bottle tiny.\n        \n\n         Buy reading glasses if you need to, because Alder, even with a few misfires, is an exciting restaurant. Now that WD-50 serves only tasting menus, it belongs as much to the global foodie circuit as it does to the Lower East Side. Alder feels the way WD-50 used to. Some customers are there to write blog posts on the food, and some are just there to talk or flirt or drink one mai tai too many or look around and once in a while say, \u201cWow, that was cool.\u201d\n        \n\n         With such ordinary tactics as small plates and reasonable prices, Alder has done something out of the ordinary, planting avant-garde cooking in what\u2019s left of downtown alternative culture. It belongs to anybody who wants to see things differently.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 26, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-alder-in-the-east-village.html", "google_mag": 30.200000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n            Wheat noodles blur at the edges. At their core, they taste of cooked flour, or flour and egg, but toward the surface, they take on the flavor of their sauce. Think of pappardelle allied with a meaty rag\u00f9, or spools of ramen entwined with pork broth, throwing off starch, drinking in soup. Their boundaries dissolve.\n           \n\n            Rice noodles have very little flavor of their own and generally don\u2019t take on much, either. They tend to make a hard break with their surrounding flavors; the more intense those flavors, the more welcome the break. They are almost pure texture.\n           \n\n            The favorite noodle in the Yunnan Province of southwestern China is a long, round, spaghetti-like rice noodle called mixian. It is the specialty at\n            \n             Little Tong Noodle Shop\n            \n            , a small, new, inexpensive restaurant in the East Village. Little Tong\u2019s mixian seems to have a barely perceptible sour tang, but it is the very soft and elusively smooth texture that is most memorable. Just when your mouth is about to get some purchase on the noodles, away they slip.\n           \n\n            Little Tong Noodle Shop plunges mixian into soups and sauces that make a definite impression. Yunnan shares borders with Tibet, Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos; northern Thailand is not too far, either. The characteristic Southeast Asian tension of saltiness, sourness and chile heat creeps into these noodle bowls. They are buoyed by green herbs, too, by mint and cilantro, and by the tendency of the chef, Simone Tong, to twist contrasting strands of flavor together.\n           \n\n            Fundamentally, the banna shrimp mixian is a tomato soup, removed from Campbell\u2019s reach by a whiff of smoke and a slight taste of shrimp and crab shells. Wheels of pickled green chiles add not just heat but depth; there are fried shallots, too, and fresh mint, stirred in along with coconut.\n           \n\n            In the grandma chicken mixian, a dark and grainy oil slick \u2014 a distillation of garlic and black sesame \u2014 dyes and deepens a chicken broth that is already so full-bodied it\u2019s almost sticky. Resting on top of the rice noodles is chicken confit, which, in terms of moistness and flavor, is the exact opposite of the desiccated, used-up meat typically found in chicken soups. There are spicy red bits of fermented chile, some salty and sour pickles, an egg boiled in pu-erh tea, and long ivory chrysanthemum petals. It has to be the most interesting chicken noodle soup in the city right now.\n           \n\n            Another soup, the \u201clittle pot\u201d mixian, tastes something like a spicy miso ramen that has shed its excess weight and picked up extra flavors. Chopped shiitakes and pork belly sit on the surface of the salty, milky pork broth, along with garlic chives and minced stems of pickled mustard greens. If this had been ramen, I would have left some noodles behind, but I finished this bowl, all of it, in an astonished haze, and didn\u2019t regret it.\n           \n\n\n\n            Little Tong Noodle Shop is Ms. Tong\u2019s first restaurant as chef. She is also an owner. It is a modest place in many ways. The drinks list offers one red, one white, one ros\u00e9 and a handful of beers and sakes. (The best choice may be Yunnanese tea.)\n           \n\n            There are 28 indoor seats, some pale wood slats on one wall, and exposed brick on another. The Noodle Shop does not necessarily invite comparisons to a more famous Noodle Bar three doors south on First Avenue, but it does not exactly discourage comparisons to David Chang\u2019s restaurant, either.\n           \n\n            Like Mr. Chang, who cooked for\n            \n             Tom Colicchio\n            \n            before opening the first Momofuku, Ms. Tong threaded a path toward Asian noodles that ran through modern New York restaurant kitchens. Born in Chengdu, China, she went to culinary school in the United States. She worked as an intern for Masato Shimizu while he was still at 15 East, and cooked for Wylie Dufresne at\n            \n             WD-50\n            \n            and\n            \n             Alder\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            It\u2019s easier to see an American chef\u2019s sensibility in the section of the menu called \u201clittle eats,\u201d which are free of noodles and give Ms. Tong a chance to evoke Yunnan with East Coast ingredients. She coaxes impressive flavors from a small amount of cold Chinese broccoli dressed in citrus soy, with a salty, crunchy and smoky dusting of grated egg yolk. The \u201cmini stir fry,\u201d a seasonal improvisation, was made recently with fiddlehead ferns, pine nuts and tender, lime-green needles from the spring tips of spruce branches.\n           \n\n            They eat flowers in Yunnan, and Ms. Tong seems to recognize the value, in the age of Instagram, of a strategically deployed blossom or two. (They eat insects in Yunnan, too, but you don\u2019t see her garnishing plates with deep-fried bamboo grubs.) In the case of the excellent egg drop soup, the stray petals had less presence than the corn kernels and salmon roe and the rags of cooked egg whites in the translucent broth.\n           \n\n            But I liked the peppery bite that chrysanthemum brought to the grandma chicken mixian and found the rose petals on the Yunnan salad to be more than just decorative. You will think this salad belongs in a trattoria when I tell you that it is composed mainly of radicchio and prosciutto, but no Italian would then go on to add fresh pineapple and boiled beef tendon.\n           \n\n            One night I ate peanut butter cookies for dessert. I\u2019ve never seen them again. Where in Yunnan they came from, I don\u2019t know; where they\u2019ve gone, I can only guess. My latest meal there ended with six flavors of fruit sorbet in gumball-size scoops topped, of course, with edible flowers.\n           \n\n            The noodles cost either $14 or $15, except for one special, which is $16. Every appetizer is under $10 except the chopped raw beef, which is dressed with shallot oil and chile oil and can be spread on flaky, oily scallion bread with a daub of Sichuan-spiced beef fat or a swipe of smoked egg yolk. For this I paid $13 without griping. In fact, because Little Tong\u2019s prices include service, they all seemed too low to be real.\n           \n\n            I wouldn\u2019t mind if Ms. Tong asked $16 or $17 for noodles, rather than charging $1 each for chile oil, chile soy sauce and fermented chiles. People in Yunnan like to doctor their broth to taste from a whole range of condiments and spices; it\u2019s part of the experience. Ms. Tong has a precise palate, I think, but there were times when I wanted to recalibrate the broth.\n           \n\n            Little Tong Noodle Shop is strict about not seating incomplete parties, even when the place is empty. Once you have a table, though, the servers are quick and sympathetic.\n           \n\n            The dining room is overseen by Emmeline Zhao, who has the twin titles of general manager and panda caretaker. One of the sakes comes in a glass decorated with painted pandas, like an old Welch\u2019s jelly jar. Panda art hangs in the front window, and if you are ever called on to administer the Heimlich maneuver to a panda, the custom-drawn choking poster by the restroom door should provide all the information you need.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 27, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/dining/little-tong-noodle-shop-review-east-village.html", "google_mag": 29.299999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n            Warnings about the risks of eating raw shellfish and eggs are now fairly routine on menus. Somewhat less common are disclaimers like the one that appears next to an asterisk on the drinks menu of Jean-Georges Vongerichten\u2019s latest restaurant,\n            \n             ABCV\n            \n            :\n           \n\n            \u201cThese statements have not been evaluated by the FDA. These products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. If you are pregnant, nursing, have a medical condition or take medications, please consult with a healthcare professional before use.\u201d\n           \n\n            This note refers to a group of juice blends with ingredients from ayurvedic and other medical traditions, and what the Food and Drug Administration has not signed off on are not so much statements as nebulous targets that the juices may or may not hit. The first one I drank was tangerine and black currant juice dosed with rhodiola, St. John\u2019s wort and albizia, which some believe fight anxiety and depression. ABCV calls this beverage Joy.\n           \n\n            Those who follow Mr. Vongerichten know the chef to be a protean shape-shifter. Over the years, he has championed Asian fusion, luxe American comfort food and border-dissolving pan-Latinism, among other things, all while holding down the fort of modern haute cuisine at\n            \n             Jean-Georges\n            \n            . Still, it is a bit surprising to see him pop up as a pitchman for drinks that require cutting and pasting verbiage from\n            \n             section 101.93\n            \n            of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n           \n\n            The V in ABCV performs triple duty, standing for vegetables, vibrations and Vongerichten. It does not officially signify vegan, although many things on the menu are. Sustainable farming is favored. Ingredients whose genes have been monkeyed with are avoided. The aromas of cooking animal flesh do not pollute the atmosphere of the dining room, which is loftlike and white with a few brightly colored chairs, like the lounge in \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d ABCV sits on East 19th Street, inside ABC Carpet & Home and side by side with\n            \n             ABC Kitchen\n            \n            and\n            \n             ABC Cocina\n            \n            . Mr. Vongerichten owns and operates all three with Paulette Cole, the store\u2019s proprietor.\n           \n\n            Sustainability was a theme in the first two ABC restaurants, but ABCV extends the idea into a boutique wellness exercise. It is the sort of restaurant where the menu has a preface. ABCV, it explains, \u201cis here to serve, inform and inspire a cultural shift towards plant-based intelligence.\u201d The food is not simply vegetarian. It is \u201chigh vibration,\u201d and has the goal of nurturing \u201cour personal and planetary ecosystems.\u201d\n           \n\n            An insert within the menu, illustrated with pretty watercolor drawings, goes into detail on the health benefits of various plants you may encounter.\n           \n\n            I found the menu\u2019s prose mildly indigestible, but the food it describes is light, colorful, fresh and easy to like. Some of it is memorable, and none of it makes you feel as if you have asked your stomach to do things it wasn\u2019t meant to do. These are the two sides of ABCV: a missionary message combined with cooking that has a large measure of creativity and surprise. I guess that qualifies as \u201chigh vibration.\u201d\n           \n\n            Some of the most engaging courses at ABCV are dips. The gold medal in this event goes to the green hummus made with fresh chickpeas and Thai basil and served with substantial puffs of whole-grain pita. Good hummus has many fine qualities, but it is rarely exciting. This is. Running a close second is the labneh fortified with shallots, which give it some of the charm of an old-fashioned cocktail-party onion dip. It is great on purple potato chips or cucumbers (\u201ca warrior against hypertension and heart disease\u201d).\n           \n\n            Mr. Vongerichten and his chef de cuisine, Neal Harden, focus their salads in ways that turn them into precise statements. There\u2019s nothing random about the pairing of bitter radicchio with ripe strawberries, a few of which are crushed so they get smeared around the purple leaves and join forces with the saffron vinaigrette.\n           \n\n            Warm appetizers are built with a similar care. Grilled caps of donko shiitakes the size of muffin tops are spread with a green goddess dressing with a tingling charge of yuzukosho. The mushrooms (whose B vitamins help \u201cmanage physical and emotional stress\u201d) come with caramelized fennel, a more apt partner than you might guess.\n           \n\n            Roasted carrots (\u201ceat with oil or a fat to absorb the full benefit of her beta-carotene\u201d) are spritzed with lime and piled over an excellent and spicy butter, ground from toasted nuts and seeds.\n           \n\n            All of this is many miles away in flavor and charisma from the dour school of vegetable cookery that has been dished out recently by young, Nordic-influenced chefs I think of as the Brotherhood of the Charred Sunchoke. These chefs avoid the spices, citrus and chiles of warmer climates, presumably in tribute to their North Star, the Copenhagen restaurant\n            \n             Noma\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            Mr. Vongerichten and Mr. Harden aren\u2019t playing in that sandbox. They\u2019ve got their own toys. When a squirt of lime juice can help, squirt they will.\n           \n\n            One or two dishes struck this omnivore as not quite complete. A plate of crisp, salty, horseradish-spiked sauerkraut made from savoy cabbage was a little monotonous on its own. I\u2019ll bet it\u2019s fantastic on a hot dog.\n           \n\n            I also wanted more heft from the parts of the menu headed \u201cnoodles and rice\u201d and \u201clegumes and grains.\u201d In the wild rice with spring vegetables and fermented carrots, rice was an ensemble player, not the lead.\n           \n\n            And when my server recommended the spinach spaghetti by means of a story about cooking pasta at his mother\u2019s side, I was hoping for more than a sparrow\u2019s nest of green noodles under a mulch of kale and broccoli (\u201ca cruciferous that prevents premature aging\u201d). The flavors were very good, livened up with preserved lemons, but I had to manage my stomach\u2019s expectations.\n           \n\n            Desserts are unpredictable. You could get a grainy, thick, cakelike pudding trying to pass for chocolate mousse. Or you could have an exemplary pavlova outfitted with strawberries and rhubarb.\n           \n\n            And yet, I always got up from the table feeling pretty good. True, the health claims are not made in a style that appeals to everyone. ABCV goes in a little too much for\n            \n             the Goop style\n            \n            of transactional nutrition: If you eat X, then Y will (or won\u2019t) happen.\n           \n\n            But since I tend to treat nutritional advice the way the owner of a new Lamborghini treats speed-limit signs, I sent ABCV\u2019s menu to\n            \n             Jeffrey B. Blumberg\n            \n            , who researches antioxidants at Tufts University. For the most part, he approved. The specific claims looked largely accurate to him, and the more general ones struck him as vague enough to be harmless.\n           \n\n            \u201cI\u2019m not giving it a scientific endorsement for precision,\u201d Dr. Blumberg said. \u201cBut this kind of information, in a very subtle way, gives you the idea that each of these plant foods gives you different things. And if you put enough of them on your plate, you\u2019ll be eating according to the\n            \n             Dietary Guidelines for Americans\n            \n            , which very few people follow.\u201d\n           \n\n            Did I eat more vegetables than usual at ABCV? Yes. Will it stop me from aging? Time will tell. Did my Joy bring me joy? Maybe not, but it didn\u2019t make matters worse, either.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 28, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/03/dining/abcv-review-vegetables-restaurant-jean-georges-vongerichten.html", "google_mag": 33.900001525878906}, {"review_text": "\n            Jared Sippel might have had too much time to think before he opened\n            \n             Italienne\n            \n            . The restaurant, the chef\u2019s first in New York City, has been open since the fall and is on its way to being something well out of the ordinary. But Mr. Sippel is trying to do so many things at once that his point of view gets garbled. The potential for confusion is even embedded in the name, which means Italian in French.\n           \n\n            Two rooms, with different styles and food, are spread out across a deep, high-ceilinged spot just west of Madison Square Park. Up front is the Taverna, where you can study the generally Italian menu of snacks and more over a cocktail and some pink folds of San Daniele prosciutto, shaved on a fire-engine-red slicer that is on display at the end of the bar like\n            \n             Clark Gable\u2019s Harley at Kiehl\u2019s\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            Past the bar you enter the polished, expensive Dining Room, where the food is much more French, is arranged with an eye on negative space, and is available \u00e0 la carte or as a six-course, $140 tasting menu, wine pairing optional. On Monday nights, this half of the enterprise switches over to a four-course set menu devoted to the cooking of a single region, which could be French, or Italian.\n           \n\n            These party-in-the-front, business-in-the-back setups are complex propositions. They\u2019re not hot-dog stands. Mr. Sippel has made a tough job tougher by taking on two countries and more than one style of cooking, and layering the formal-casual split on top. At times, Italienne is like somebody who starts to tell you a joke about a priest, a rabbi and an imam in a rowboat and ends up talking about Maimonidean law.\n           \n\n            Mr. Sippel moved to New York four years ago after his cooking at Quince in San Francisco and Frasca Food and Wine in Boulder, Colo., put him in the national eye. He had been hired to be the chef of the Manhattan edition of\n            \n             Chef\u2019s Table at Brooklyn Fare\n            \n            , which was supposed to be imminent. It wasn\u2019t. Mr. Sippel finally dropped out to work on a place of his own, which beat the new Brooklyn Fare to opening by about a month.\n           \n\n            Along the way, he brought together a talented crew. Erica O\u2019Neal, who had been a sommelier at Frasca, stockpiled mostly French and Italian wines for a discovery-packed list that is full of twists and turns even at its cheap end. The desserts and pastries are under Rebecca Isbell, whose work made the end of a meal at Betony something to look forward to. His business partner and general manager is James King, a well-rounded pro who put in time at both Frasca and Brooklyn Fare.\n           \n\n            Everybody is out to make a good impression. One busy night in the Taverna, when my guests and I had to wait at the bar for about 20 minutes past our reservation time, we were handed glasses of prosecco before we had finished our cocktails. When we got to the table, two of the Italian snacks the menu calls stuzzichini were waiting for us: warm arancini with melted fior di latte at their core, and panzerotti, little turnovers filled with bits of warm salumi and scamorza.\n           \n\n            It was more of an apology than the situation called for. On the other hand, every apology should taste so good.\n           \n\n            On a quick read, the Taverna\u2019s menu is like the ones at many other casual Italian spots. A deeper look, though, reveals more originality than usual. Scattered among the Italian favorites are a few French ideas, like the subtly curried cauliflower gratin under a tan layer of Comt\u00e9. One of the snacks was a kind of sandwich filled with something like hash browns; crisp fried triangles of cheese take the place of bread. Eating it is like getting a tax refund you weren\u2019t expecting.\n           \n\n            Under pasta was another big surprise: delicate little cabbage-and-bread dumplings the size of Swedish meatballs. They\u2019re from far northern Italy, where they\u2019re known as canederli. Italienne gave them an Eastern European lilt by serving them with beets, horseradish and applesauce. Mr. Sippel seemed to reach beyond the borders again with the caraway seeds and excellent braised red cabbage he brought to a plate of pork \u2014 tender ribs and a juicy chop that got a little too much finishing salt but were still close to perfect.\n           \n\n            Ms. Isbell\u2019s desserts in the Taverna made some unexpected moves, too. Her lemon tart was wonderful and showed a sense of humor; with a cloak of white lemon icing outside and a soft filling of lemon-poppy seed cream inside, it looked just like a wedge of Camembert. But I don\u2019t know what to make of her baba au rhum, which tasted like a two-day-old coconut doughnut that had been accidentally splashed with liquor at the bar.\n           \n\n            My first meal in the Dining Room was on a Monday, when the four-course menu was supposedly inspired by the northern Rhone. I had trouble seeing the connection, but I enjoyed it all. There was an exceptional velout\u00e9 of squash and apples with a fat lobe of foie gras, and a little meditation on beef and spring onions, with a Syrah-glazed beef cheek and a slice of strip loin. Dessert was a tart of dense, rich chocolate layered over salted caramel. It was an ideal end for a dinner of refined bistro food.\n           \n\n            When I went back on another night, though, the plates were excessively fussed over, self-conscious and forced, with the form of haute cuisine but not the sense. It was like reading a French text that had been run through Google\u2019s translator and then back again.\n           \n\n            The frogs\u2019 legs hidden inside a frizz of kataifi were almost flavorless, and a white garlic sauce had a sharp, raw bite. Snails and strips of prosciutto strewn over buttered pappardelle never came together, and bull\u2019s-eyes of pasta called corzetti stampati were dotted with beet greens and a walnut pesto that was sweet when it should have been savory.\n           \n\n            Other dishes were better, but the only complete successes were the warm herb fougasse, served on a hook like a Bavarian pretzel, and Ms. Isbell\u2019s desserts \u2014 a rhubarb granita with salty candied pistachios, and a weird, inspired oat bavarois veined with chocolate ganache.\n           \n\n            Some of the food at Italienne made me want to dance on the table. Some of it made me want to hide under the table and wait for the lights to go out so I could leave without making eye contact. My three meals might have come from three different restaurants. I would settle for one where the ideas had been worked out. At the moment, that is the Taverna.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 29, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/dining/italienne-review-restaurant-jared-sippel.html", "google_mag": 24.0}, {"review_text": "\n         IF YOU HAVE a wide-ranging appetite and more time than money, there\u2019s never been a better time to eat in New York. Every corner of the city is churning out affordable hits of deliciousness, and a long wait is often the only obstacle between wanting some and getting some. Even acclaimed chefs are in this game now, making creative cooking more accessible than ever. And if the meal turns out to be less exciting than you had hoped, you\u2019ve lost only a few hours and a few dollars. The next day will bring some new taste, a Filipino tapas bar or an artisanal spaetzle truck.\n        \n\n         So while much of the nonconformist Mexican food at Mission Cantina is curiously unsatisfying, the disappointment does not sting the way it would if the prices were higher.\n        \n\n         The chef is Danny Bowien, who has a deep talent for short-order cooking that takes loopy twists and turns. His first New York restaurant,\n         \n          Mission Chinese Food\n         \n         , bent Sichuan cuisine into strange new shapes. Its kung pao pastrami, which sounds like a parody of modern food trends, is something I crave on a regular basis. (For now, I am out of luck. A family of mice believed it had squatter\u2019s rights on the address, and Mr. Bowien, following a Department of Health order, has closed the restaurant until he can evict the unwanted residents.)\n        \n\n         Starting with Mission Chinese, Mr. Bowien has been committed to keeping his restaurants within reach of the nonrich. This has become all the more admirable as\n         \n          awards\n         \n         and\n         \n          accolades\n         \n         have piled up around his limited-edition sneakers. Mission Cantina, which opened on the Lower East Side around Thanksgiving, charges less than $10 for almost everything on the menu and gives away sparkling water.\n        \n\n         For those prices, you don\u2019t grumble too loudly when a dish fizzles. And while some of the food can be remarkable and original, a surprising number of things do fizzle on this menu, a book of wet matches from a chef who can make sparks shoot from his fingertips.\n        \n\n         Like\n         \n          April Bloomfield\n         \n         ,\n         \n          Dan Kluger\n         \n         and\n         \n          Alex Stupak\n         \n         , Mr. Bowien brings the habits of a modern American chef to Mexican food. When making tacos, he sees the tortilla not as an edible utensil but as an edible plate.\n         \n\n\n          Chile\n         \n         vinegar is available if you ask, but otherwise there is no do-it-yourself taco doctoring. Each taco is a composed dish, garnished and sauced in its own way, theoretically complete.\n        \n\n         The theory was sometimes true in practice. I loved the mushrooms hiding under what looked like a mutant pepperoni wheel but was really a round of shredded Jack cheese browned on the griddle. A white mush of stewed zucchini with fresh oregano was much more appealing than it will ever sound, and a warm gust of Mediterranean ingredients like pine nuts and raisins did wonderful things for small, sweet eggplant.\n        \n\n         After the skin-rippling heat of Mission Chinese, the calmer spicing at Mission Cantina is a small surprise, though not necessarily a liability. I didn\u2019t taste much cumin in cumin lamb, but the meat got by on its own assertive flavor. A hunk of braised pork cheek was soothing and warm under shredded purple cabbage and pickled habaneros.\n        \n\n         In some tacos, though, the main ingredients faltered. Fermenting the pineapple in tacos al pastor gave it a tingly acidity, but the pork belly beneath it was flabby and flavorless. The shrimp in a mixed marriage with fried beef tripe tasted heavily of iodine. Carnitas had been disassembled into little fragments of cracklings folded into excessively mild pork shoulder. The parts didn\u2019t go back together again, like a clock taken apart by a 5-year-old.\n        \n\n         Underwhelming fillings like these rarely drew much energy from salsas, which tended to fade into the background. A cucumber salad was dressed by a peanut salsa that seemed to be just ground peanuts. It didn\u2019t do much for the cucumbers, which had been left in their thick, bitter skins.\n        \n\n         Some of the best things on the menu are not in taco form. I would run back for the fried chicken wings, dusted with a spice mix that\u2019s like a dehydrated\n         \n\n\n          mole\n         \n         poblano, down to the sesame seeds and chocolate. Mexican cousins of the magnificent ones from Mission Chinese Food, the wings are one of the few dishes in which Mission Cantina pushes so hard against the original cuisine that it breaks through to the other side. Crunchy, fiery and messy, they are both recognizable and new.\n        \n\n         There\u2019s almost nothing recognizably Mexican about the bowl of supple, tender collards braised in beer above fluffy, creamy masa treated like grits. With an angry orange sluice of hot sauce on top, this masa is Southern, if it\u2019s anything, and it\u2019s so good I ordered a second bowl while I was still spooning up the first, shaking my head over the profound corn flavor.\n        \n\n         Consistency was beside the point at Mission Chinese Food, which could have been subtitled Fast, Cheap and Out of Control. None of the dishes there tasted the same way twice, but they always tasted good. That\u2019s not the case at Mission Cantina, where little variations from night to night can mean trouble.\n        \n\n         Deep-fried chicken livers on a tostada spread with pur\u00e9ed white beans were as creamy and sweet as whipped butter one night. On another they were hard, dry, unlovable things, and the pickled chipotles that had made the tostada so exciting the first time were applied stingily. Maybe the kitchen was running low on supplies, because the tacos were missing the white onions that usually lent them a crisp, juicy lift. Later in the meal, a rotisserie chicken, good if not earth moving, came with rice so greasy I put down my fork.\n        \n\n         The tortillas varied, too, but they have been getting better. A little dense at first, they have started to bloom on the griddle into a low-rise fluffiness. But from the start they have had that deep, fragrant corn flavor that I had admired in the bowl of collards.\n        \n\n         Mission Cantina makes all its masa from excellent dried field corn kernels, which is not especially complicated but takes time and effort. The work is absolutely worth it, opening up flavors and aromas that are as alluring as they are short-lived.\n        \n\n         Making masa from scratch is not, to put it mildly, the easiest way to run a Mexican restaurant. If you are running an inexpensive Mexican restaurant on the Lower East Side, it\u2019s almost lunatic. And it\u2019s awesome. It tastes like a promise from Mr. Bowien that one day everything on the menu will soar to its level.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 30, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/dining/restaurant-review-mission-cantina-on-the-lower-east-side.html", "google_mag": 34.0}, {"review_text": "\n         We were halfway through appetizers at\n         \n\n\n          Cherche Midi\n         \n         , passing the steak tartare and spreading anchovy toasts with softly jiggly Parmesan custard, when one of my guests suddenly tilted his head and listened. He looked like the boy in a tornado movie who notices that the birds have stopped singing.\n        \n\n         \u201cThere\u2019s no music,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have speakers all over the dining room, but they\u2019re not using them.\u201d\n        \n\n         The restaurateur Keith McNally opened\n         \n          Cherche Midi\n         \n         in June on the corner of Houston Street and the Bowery, in a neighborhood where you don\u2019t go out to dinner unless you are prepared to shout over some Pavement song the chef loved in college. But we were talking, with no recorded soundtrack, as if we were in some Continental restaurant off Sutton Place in 1964 eating\n         \n          veal Orloff\n         \n         by candlelight.\n        \n\n         This is the paradox of Mr. McNally. Food writers who were still eating applesauce through a straw when he opened his first restaurant (\n         \n          the Odeon\n         \n         , 1980) write about him with the same reverence that music writers have for\n         \n\n\n          Leonard Cohen\n         \n         . He\u2019s\n         \n          \u201cthe king of cool,\u201d\n         \n         the restaurateur who\n         \n          \u201cowns NYC.\u201d\n         \n         Yet when it comes to current dining trends, particularly those in favor downtown, Mr. McNally shows a healthy disregard, verging at times on hostility.\n        \n\n         Of the six restaurants he operates between 14th Street and Canal Street, Cherche Midi may be his most thorough repudiation of the downtown scene. It isn\u2019t just music that\u2019s missing. There\u2019s almost no view of the street. Tapas, shared plates, tasting menus, wine pairings, \u201cChef recommends,\u201d two-hour waits for a table the size of a chessboard \u2014 no, none of that. Nor did Cherche Midi\u2019s servers try to tell me \u201chow the menu works,\u201d as if it were some complicated and expensive piece of machinery that I was likely to break.\n        \n\n         In Mr. McNally\u2019s restaurants, chefs are rarely treated like stars. At Cherche Midi, two men, Shane McBride and Daniel Parilla, share the work and the\n         \n\n\n          credit\n         \n         . As a result, perhaps, their cooking is almost egoless; it\u2019s not about what they want. It\u2019s about what you want, especially if that happens to be red meat and French wine.\n        \n\n         The prime rib may be the only dish at Cherche Midi that could be accused of trying to make an impression. The dark, roasted edges had the irresistible intensity of the bark on great barbecued brisket, even on the night they were aggressively salted. Lending this slab of dry-aged beef a bit of finesse is the side dish of pommes souffl\u00e9es, like inflatable potato chips or, as one guest said, \u201cgluten-free beignets.\u201d\n        \n\n         The menu gives three more main-course slots to beef. Steak frites does a fine impersonation of a Parisian bistro steak, the kind you don\u2019t mind chewing and chewing between glasses of the house Beaujolais Villages, served at Cherche Midi in an $18 carafe. Filet mignon au poivre is far more tender, of course, with less sacrifice in flavor than usual. The tall, compact, rather lean, drip-free and wholly excellent burger is made from dry-aged prime rib; if you put your nose close enough, you can smell the meat locker right through the aroma of onion-bacon jam. All three dishes come with dark, skinny fries.\n        \n\n         Cherche Midi is so good with beef that even the best of the other main courses may register as a half step down: a pot of fat, clean mussels with bits of preserved lemon clinging to them; a roast chicken done right; a salade ni\u00e7oise that pays attention to the last detail, including, in a wonderful departure from tradition, the pile of smashed potato salad at the bottom of the bowl.\n        \n\n         Here and there, the kitchen tends to overembellish. The decent roasted salmon comes with a lentil salad that tries to do too many things at once, and limp white stewed onions and fennel did not give skate Grenobloise (billed as meuni\u00e8re) anything that it really needed. It would be nice, too, to taste the meat under the aggressive seasoning in the steak tartare appetizer, given the chefs are clearly buying good beef. At least it made a strong impression, which is more than I can say for the $18 heirloom tomato salad. Heirlooms from where, exactly? Food Emporium?\n        \n\n         Still, unless you are coming to Cherche Midi to commune with the essence of summer, it is a good enough salad. The desserts are much better than that. The floating islands, the mocha pot de cr\u00e8me, the small pink raspberry souffl\u00e9 hovering above a bed of warm berries \u2014 the lineup is one argument after another for bringing back old-fashioned pleasures.\n        \n\n         After a recent tour of all his restaurants, I think Mr. McNally\u2019s great talent may be knowing which things are worth worrying about and which can get by with being just good enough. At\n         \n          Morandi\n         \n         , the main courses were almost impressive in their mediocrity, but the pasta was just swell, which may be all the place needs to keep its chairs full. The short-rib patty melt was the only good dish on a table full of disappointments at\n         \n          Schiller\u2019s Liquor Bar\n         \n         , but I enjoyed myself more than I have at far better restaurants.\n        \n\n         There is a limit, though, and\n         \n          Balthazar\n         \n         is approaching it. The cooking, under Mr. McBride, has become utterly mundane, a pretty but flavorless imitation of French food of the kind found at any generic fake bistro. Cherche Midi\u2019s salade ni\u00e7oise is delicious from start to finish; Balthazar\u2019s is a bowl of ingredients that can\u2019t remember what they\u2019re supposed to taste like. How can the same chef and the same restaurateur be responsible for both?\n        \n\n         Mr. McNally does worry about service, which at Cherche Midi manages to be everywhere without crossing the line to helicopter waitering. And, of course, he worries about the interiors. Cherche Midi\u2019s is lovely. Outside is a dystopian intersection. You\u2019d never know it in the dining room, which feels intimate, almost private, although of course every face is on display, bathed in light the color of apricot jam.\n        \n\n         For three decades, Mr. McNally has been rooting around in the same Lego kit: distressed mirrors, chipped subway tiles, bottles backlighted to look like stained glass. In his hands, these well-worn tricks give restaurants the battered nobility of a vintage Saab. When anyone else tries, they end up with a 1986\n         \n\n\n          Ford Escort\n         \n         . Sets and lighting will never be the whole show.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 31, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/dining/restaurant-review-keith-mcnallys-cherche-midi.html", "google_mag": 28.0}, {"review_text": "\n         \u201cThey say we\u2019re looking at two hours. They\u2019ll call us.\u201d\n        \n\n         This was the grim report from inside the latest East Village restaurant to have turned its no-reservations policy into a viral marketing campaign. A small, hungry mob was gathering on the sidewalk. Hoping to find a pleasant place to drink and snack until the phone rang, I herded my group to Huertas, a new Basque-leaning tapas place a few blocks away.\n        \n\n         The room smelled like garlic and smoke. A cured pig\u2019s leg sat at the end of the bar, its ankle held tightly in a clamp. A sharp knife had exposed its interior architecture of meat and fat and sinew. Later, we ordered a few slices of this Iberico ham, and as it melted on our tongues, warm and salty, we all traded looks. We did it again when we ate crumbly shards of aged manchego that tasted of brown butter and caramel. The looks meant: This kitchen knows where to get the good stuff.\n        \n\n         That applied to many things we ate that night. Jonah Miller, Huertas\u2019s chef, has written a concise menu of Basque-inspired tapas, not all of which could be called cooking and a fair amount of which is canned. I am not revealing any secrets here. Some food is still in its can when it comes to the table, like the dense mackerel in olive oil, which we ate, happily, on sliced baguettes with piment\u00f3n aioli.\n        \n\n         \u201cAll the best Basque seafood goes straight into cans,\u201d our server told us, and she was so convincing that we asked if she knew a store that sold these marvelous cans. She did. She also knew where we could buy the manchego, which she was as excited about as we were. From the front door to the table, our service had been proactively friendly and enthusiastic. In New York, servers who learn that night\u2019s menu are rare enough; here was one who seemed to know everything about every ingredient. She told us about a restaurant in\n         \n\n\n          San Sebasti\u00e1n\n         \n         , where the chef had come out of the kitchen to point out the most delicious parts of a turbot, showing her how to scoop out his favorite part, the cheeks. Then she took a deep breath and said: \u201c\n         \n\n\n          Spain\n         \n         , you guys.\u201d\n        \n\n         It wasn\u2019t all cans and hams in Mr. Miller\u2019s kitchen, not that I would have minded. We asked for something called Huertas rotos, which turned out to be the Basque dish huevos rotos interpreted as a kind of pasta dish. Skinny threads of potato were cooked al dente and tossed with chorizo and its oil, with a soft-cooked egg on top. It was gone in 30 seconds.\n        \n\n         We drank vermouth, made on site, while every few minutes somebody came around with a tray of small bites straight from the kitchen. There was egg salad on a slice of baguette, with a sweet red shrimp on top; a golden croqueta of rice with creamy mushrooms in the center; and sweet roasted piquillo peppers stuffed with a cheesy, porky froth of fresh sausage whipped into goat cheese. These came in single servings that you could take or decline, depending on how good they looked and how hungry you were. Each plate you took was marked down on a card, dim-sum style, by servers.\n        \n\n         Huertas calls these items pintxos, a Basque term for snacks smaller than tapas and pinned together with a toothpick. In Spain, pintxos do not circulate like dim sum. (Mr. Miller got the idea from\n         \n          State Bird Provisions\n         \n         in\n         \n\n\n          San Francisco\n         \n         .) Yet we felt much closer to the Spanish tapas-bar spirit than if we had ordered 10 or 15 \u201csmall plates meant for sharing\u201d at once, passed them around the table and called it dinner. This is rarely a satisfying way to eat, but it\u2019s how many Spanish restaurants in New York deal with tapas. The Huertas modified dim-sum approach was perfect for people like us, who want to start with drinks and see how the night goes without being forced to turn tapas into dinner.\n        \n\n         The way this night went was that by the time the other restaurant called, we didn\u2019t want to leave.\n        \n\n         I went back to Huertas a week or two later. I had made reservations for the small, square back dining room, where Mr. Miller serves a set menu for $55. In the front room, the plates are unconnected episodes, and you supply the narrative yourself. In the back, you settle in while Mr. Miller tells a story in five courses.\n        \n\n         He started with a nod to the front room, a plate of little bites. There were gildas, found in every tapas bar in San Sebasti\u00e1n, sharp, clean and salty skewers of white anchovy threaded with spicy green pepper and an olive. There was a blistered mound of Padr\u00f3n peppers and garlic shrimp on toothpicks, too, not the sweetest or firmest I\u2019d ever eaten. This was an anomaly; in general, the cooking at Huertas stands out for its pure, fresh flavors.\n        \n\n         Then a separated egg. The white, fried, lay under a jumble of corn and tomatoes cooked quickly with crisp-chewy piment\u00f3n-cured bacon. The yolk, raw, sat on top and served as sauce.\n        \n\n         Next was skate, sweet and still a little juicy inside, with roasted turnips and a pale-green, herbaceous sauce of pur\u00e9ed turnip greens and fennel. The seasonal Greenmarket aesthetic was familiar to me. Would any Basques recognize the dish? They would know the next course, wonderful garlic-and-piment\u00f3n-scented lamb hot dogs called chistorra, even though they would be used to seeing chistorras made with pork or beef. Alongside these house-made sausages, Mr. Miller had a wonderful succotash of late-summer beans.\n        \n\n         Dessert was a dream, a round and closely packed little goat-cheese cheesecake with a topping of candied almonds instead of a bottom crust. More tangy than sugary, the cake took beautifully to a sauce made from ripe nectarines.\n        \n\n         This night and a later one made it clear that dinner in Huertas\u2019s back room ranks among the best deals in town, up there with the how-do-they-do-it bargains at Contra and\n         \n\n\n          Delaware\n         \n         & Hudson. Mr. Miller shapes his menus so skillfully that it\u2019s hard to imagine wanting more. Still, once the familiar conventions of the modern tasting menu kicked in, I did steal a few looks at the front room, where a tray of hot croquetas always seemed to be going around. Maybe I wanted more spontaneity. Or maybe I just wanted a croqueta.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 32, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/08/dining/restaurant-review-huertas-in-the-east-village.html", "google_mag": 26.399999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n         If you wanted to take the measure of Ignacio Mattos\u2019s cooking at Estela, which opened on East Houston Street in June, you might look at the burrata on the menu and think: no, too easy. Anyone can slap burrata on a plate and wait for the moaning to start. But order it anyway, so you can see what happens when Mr. Mattos puts this louche, voluptuous cheese on a juice cleanse.\n        \n\n         The burrata sits like whipped cream on charred bread. Soaking into the bread and pooling around it is a brooding green liquid pressed from lovage, sorrel, celery and other foliage. It looks like something you would force yourself to drink after doing very bad things to your body. Ingesting it with burrata must be some kind of preventive medicine, the after-midnight ibuprofen with a bourbon chaser.\n        \n\n         That\u2019s not what it feels like, though. When this fatty sprawl of dairy is brought to heel with fresh and grassy vegetable juice, it becomes something you taste, not something that washes over you in a big creamy wave. It\u2019s strange but it\u2019s right.\n        \n\n         Strange food is often born from a need to kill boredom, ours or the cook\u2019s. It can keep kitchen and dining room awake through what would otherwise be another night of spaghetti and salad.\n        \n\n         Mr. Mattos\u2019s cooking at Estela has a mild case of weirdness. It is just unfamiliar enough that I had eaten about a meal and a half there before it dawned on me that nearly everything is Mediterranean, more or less. I should have seen that one coming, given that Mr. Mattos, who\n         \n          grew up in Uruguay\n         \n         , cooked at Chez Panisse for a year and\n         \n          Il Buco\n         \n         for five.\n        \n\n         The cooking is almost familiar, but not quite, and it\u2019s the little differences that get under your skin. The flatbread served with an excellent potato-thickened mash of salt cod is a rye matzo. And a whole squid and a spring onion, both griddled on a plancha and served with a reasonably traditional Romesco of red peppers and hazelnuts, look like a leathery, podlike alien creature alongside a blackened stem that snakes down the plate. The mild strangeness drew my attention to how deep and elemental the flavors of both dishes were.\n        \n\n         Mild strangeness hasn\u2019t always been Mr. Mattos\u2019s preferred line of attack. When he was the chef at\n         \n          Isa\n         \n         , in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, he reveled in deep, surrealist weirdness. His best-known dish there was fried sardine skeleton, which looked as if it belonged behind glass at a museum of natural oddities. I remember rattling my jaw on nearly raw grains and getting my first taste of sweet potato leaves, which until then I had thought were poisonous.\n        \n\n         Estela, which Mr. Mattos opened with two partners, Mark Connell and a wine-guy-slash-general-manager named Thomas Carter, is far less confrontational in ways that go beyond the kitchen. Within two seconds of climbing the steps to this spare and intimate little dining room, you know that there will be a speech on how the menu works, that most of the dishes will be small, that sharing will be encouraged, that the noise level will climb steeply, that the meal will cost more than the menu prices lead you to believe. (This is a particular danger if you aren\u2019t careful with wines, because Mr. Carter leads us into three-digit temptation much more often than you\u2019d expect from a list that\u2019s relatively compact.)\n        \n\n         The dishes aren\u2019t composed of pixel-size bits of food that have to be divided by laser surgery; they generally share well. This is a good start, but then Estela, like many small-plates restaurants, neglects the so-called share plates that you actually eat from if you treat each new creation from the kitchen as a serving platter. The share plates at Estela are no bigger than tea saucers, and are rarely swapped out. One night assorted juices and sauces from eight recipes swirled together before a fresh plate came along. It was like seeing eight movies projected on the same screen at once.\n        \n\n         New or bigger plates would help you to focus on the energetic crackle Mr. Mattos gives beef tartare by folding fried sunchoke chips into the raw meat, or the low growl of spice he lends to a fried egg and gigante beans by pairing them with bread cubes dunked in harissa.\n        \n\n         Ingredients that don\u2019t appear to have been tampered with often have a depth of flavor that takes you by surprise. There\u2019s the invisible pop of yuzu and grapefruit hiding inside wheels of uncooked summer squash arranged like scales over intensely sweet raw scallops and pur\u00e9ed avocado. There\u2019s the lemon that perks up white rounds of kohlrabi dressed, simply and wonderfully, with shards of fossa cheese, mint and crushed, toasted hazelnuts.\n        \n\n         There are usually only four large plates (what we once quaintly called main courses), but Mr. Mattos makes them count. Cod is briefly salt-cured and slowly pan-seared until it surrenders into soft, meaty flakes. Pork shoulder is as juicy and red as steak, and the steak is something else again. As he does in other dishes, Mr. Mattos uses flecks of char almost as a spice. With the pulse-quickening slices of beef, the blackened edges from charred eggplant get together with the oily intensity of anchovies for an irresistible roughness and force.\n        \n\n         Desserts look simple. O.K., they are simple (there is a panna cotta and three low-key sundaes based on grapefruit, chocolate or blueberry sorbet). But Estela\u2019s consulting pastry wizard, Alex Grunert, gives each one a little snap, crackle and pop, and they end up being more satisfying than some high-end sugar landscapes.\n        \n\n         Early on, it\u2019s true, there was a sardine dish that was like a public repudiation of the one at Isa, replacing weirdness with dullness. And the night I found that the matzo was being served with drably spiced egg salad instead of that great whipped cod, I felt as if I had traded a classic six for a studio.\n        \n\n         It doesn\u2019t matter. Mr. Mattos is not trying to shock us, but he is not trying to pacify us with the tried and true, either. It\u2019s a thin line he\u2019s walking, and if he didn\u2019t wobble occasionally, that would be truly strange.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 33, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/18/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-estela-in-nolita.html", "google_mag": 20.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n\n\n\n          Jean-Georges\n         \n         is still a four-star restaurant. That is all. Thank you for your time.\n        \n\n         On second thought, there may be a little more to say. Because great restaurants can fade fast, especially these days, and\n         \n\n\n          Jean-Georges Vongerichten\n         \n         \u2019s serene flagship serves a city vastly different from the one it set out to dazzle and seduce 17 years ago last month. Back then, Jean-Georges was a radical reimagining of the grand style of French dining, \u201can entirely new kind of four-star restaurant,\u201d as\n         \n          Ruth Reichl put it in her review\n         \n         for\n         \n\n\n          The New York Times\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         Jean-Georges didn\u2019t just blow the dust off the candelabra; it tossed them out. In a room that was all right angles and\n         \n\n\n          Manhattan\n         \n         energy, men and women servers (a rarity in formal restaurants then) circulated with unfussy, level, American poise. Most of all there was the brilliant cooking, which was lighter, brighter and more embracing of other cultures than French food had any right to be.\n        \n\n         What we want from restaurants is changing, though, along with our notions of luxury. The kind of comfort Jean-Georges excels at providing makes some diners distinctly uncomfortable. Chefs who couldn\u2019t peel a banana when Jean-Georges Vongerichten got his first four-star review (\n         \n          for Lafayette\n         \n         , in 1988) now run adventurous, unluxurious dining rooms where people come for the journey and where the thrill of the ride is more important than the condition of the shock absorbers.\n        \n\n         Jean-Georges glides like a Mercedes sedan, but Mr. Vongerichten takes the curves like a\n         \n\n\n          Formula One\n         \n         driver. Consider the squab dish that just popped up on the menu. It comes on like jerk chicken, coated in a blackened rub, and while the seasonings are Middle Eastern, the searing heat is almost Jamaican. And here comes the creative leap that separates Mr. Vongerichten from other spice-peddlers: a hot sauce has been splashed around this charred squab, and it is made from flowers. A bright-orange blend of lime, fresh red chiles and peppery nasturtium petals, it makes the already fiery squab into what may be the spiciest dish ever served in a French restaurant.\n        \n\n         Over and over, Mr. Vongerichten takes risks that are almost shocking. A little canal dredged into a pool of sweet parsnip pur\u00e9e is filled with a fruity riesling raisin vinegar, straight up. Taste it alone and you pucker, but swirl it into the parsnips with a forkful of meltingly soft\n         \n\n\n          Arctic\n         \n         char under an airy black-truffle crust, and it\u2019s spectacular. In the same vein, the buttermilk sauce under red sea bream sashimi or the unsweetened lemon mousse with raw sea trout and roe are almost acidic enough on their own to clean copper pots. Taste a little of everything, though, and the sourness takes its place and galvanizes the rest.\n        \n\n         There\u2019s not much sleight-of-hand in Mr. Vongerichten\u2019s cooking. Nearly everything is visible, and the effects can still take you by surprise. Won tons stuffed with grilled foie gras are squirted, somewhat randomly, with a spiced red-wine reduction, but what makes the dish take off are the tart, crunchy passion-fruit seeds and the raw papaya chunks livened up with a dab of lime gel.\n        \n\n         This skill for getting the greatest impact from just a few components is Mr. Vongerichten\u2019s foremost talent. Most of the time, you couldn\u2019t take something away from one of his dishes without hurting the whole. This is why so many of his classics still jump with energy; they\u2019re not dragged down by pointless ornamentation.\n        \n\n         Was the sweet sea urchin with slivers of green chile and drops of yuzu on a tongue of black bread invented last week, or last century? What about that intensely aromatic lobster sauce seasoned with fenugreek and lemon grass that surrounds lobster on toast? Or the chicken with the Parmesan crust that stays crunchy for an improbably long time, even after crumbs have fallen into the lemon-butter sauce that has more lemon and more balance than ought to be possible?\n        \n\n         If you are having your first $118 four-course dinner at Jean-Georges, you won\u2019t always know. Regulars will, though. And they may start to wonder, along with me, how many of Mr. Vongerichten\u2019s new dishes are as indelible as his greatest hits? I couldn\u2019t imagine improving on any of the six savory dishes I enjoyed on a $198 tasting menu of classics. They had all snapped into place for good. The only dish on a spring tasting (same night, same length, same price) that I could pay the same compliment to were the stout asparagus stalks under morels in hollandaise, and I recall people rhapsodizing about them in 1997.\n        \n\n         This could become a danger to Jean-Georges\u2019s pre-eminence. Mr. Vongerichten and his business partner, Phil Suarez, run\n         \n          a company\n         \n         that is responsible for 22 restaurants around the world. Diners tend to worry about this empire-building in terms of quality control: Does the food suffer when the head of state is traveling?\n        \n\n         It can, even at Jean-Georges. At a recent lunch while Mr. Vongerichten was in\n         \n\n\n          Japan\n         \n         , a salmon tartare spring roll, one of the three little bites that opened the meal, wasn\u2019t crisp enough to stand up to its lettuce wrap, and the fish was barely seasoned. Gulf shrimp in an appetizer were overpowered by the heavily toasted flavors of fried artichokes and mushrooms, and a lemon-fennel aioli lacked the verve to pull it all together.\n        \n\n         These were blips, though, well within the standard deviation for one of New York\u2019s most daring and high-performing kitchens. In the long run, the greater question is whether Mr. Vongerichten is channeling more of his creativity into building new restaurants than into building dishes that might run 10 years from now on the classics menu at Jean-Georges.\n        \n\n         Because each dessert is made of several mini-desserts that riff on a single theme, it\u2019s hard to tell whether any of them has the staying power of the molten chocolate cake. (It has a permanent spot on the chocolate-themed dessert, and remains better than its imitators.) But as constructed by the pastry chef,\n         \n          Joseph Murphy\n         \n         , almost all of them are deeply, instantly lovable. For anyone feeling left behind by the current fashion for scattershot, disputatious desserts, Mr. Murphy\u2019s citrus tasting \u2014 with its tiny, crisp strudel filled with candied kumquats and pistachios, and its plush, delicately floral citron snow and citrus sections over amber riesling jelly \u2014 is an answered prayer.\n        \n\n         The wine list is book-length. But it is unusually nimble, built for versatility. The chief sommelier,\n         \n          Laura Williamson\n         \n         , has a bottle up her sleeve for any trick the kitchen might pull. Listening to her or one of her colleagues suggest a wine can be a quick, thoughtful education in the principles of pairing.\n        \n\n         The rest of the dining room staff has the original poise and unfawning attentiveness, but servers can seem remote. Smiles bloom beside some tables, but not all. Lately some top-tier restaurants have invented a new style of service that is seamless, intuitive, guided by a species of emotional intelligence. Jean-Georges hasn\u2019t quite evolved. Examples are so minor that they may sound petty, but here\u2019s one.\n        \n\n         A guest of mine approached the reception desk, a sci-fi podium populated by a row of three or four humans with unnervingly perfect teeth, at the same time as two other diners. A host tried to pair them off: \u201cAre you two together?\u201d Um, no. Another attempt was made: \u201cAre\n         \n          you\n         \n         two together?\u201d Unless Mr. Vongerichten is trying to run a matchmaking service, there are smoother ways to begin.\n        \n\n         The game can always be played at a higher level. That is the challenge for any restaurant that wants to shine among the striving competition. And Jean-Georges does shine.

After a friend and I had finished a small opening snack, the server brought our appetizers and main courses.\n        \n\n         At the same time.\n        \n\n         It\u2019s impossible to imagine any kitchen, even the most tragically inept one, making the same mistake five years ago. This was a pure symptom of the current small-plates epidemic. The old two-course menu has broken down so badly that some restaurants feel no obligation to send dishes out in any particular sequence, even if diners clearly order appetizers and mains, as we did.\n        \n\n         Until we work out some protocols for small-plate dining, the way cultures like\n         \n\n\n          Spain\n         \n         \u2019s have done, we\u2019re going to be eating on a lawless, fast-changing frontier. Sometimes innovative restaurants like\n         \n          Recette\n         \n         or\n         \n          Pearl & Ash\n         \n         come swirling out of the chaos. At other times it coughs up half-formed and unconvincing places like Telepan Local.\n        \n\n         It\u2019s easy to imagine what Bill Telepan was thinking. Since 2005 he has done all his sensible, seasonal, ingredients-first cooking in one restaurant,\n         \n          Telepan\n         \n         , on West 69th Street. In a perfect city, Telepan\u2019s success would have lured more places of its caliber to the Upper West Side. Instead, the center of gravity of\n         \n\n\n          Manhattan\n         \n         \u2019s dining scene has migrated steadily downtown, while a looser style has swept in to make even relatively youthful places like Telepan look a bit antediluvian.\n        \n\n         A small-plates menu in TriBeCa must have seemed like a way for Mr. Telepan to reach diners who couldn\u2019t find Columbus Avenue without the aid of an Uber driver. In practice, Telepan Local, which Mr. Telepan opened on Greenwich Street in early January with Joel Javier as chef de cuisine, offers most of the drawbacks of small-plates eating and almost none of the advantages.\n        \n\n         As at so many of these restaurants, the dishes at Telepan come out whenever, they land wherever, and you have no idea if you\u2019re going to get too much food or too little. The meal unfolds, or unravels, on tables built in\n         \n\n\n          Nicaragua\n         \n         from dark and white slats of wood approximately cobbled together. They are the size of the ones in cocktail lounges where, in another era, people had manhattans and mixed nuts while waiting to be moved to the dining room. Now, this is dinner: glasses for water, wine and cocktails; blue carafes for carbonated water and clear ones for filtered tap; bottles of wine; plates for eating and plates for serving; and a votive candle, all vying for two or three square feet of real estate. Something\u2019s got to give, and it is the silverware, which falls to the floor with surprising frequency. Or maybe it jumps, through some instinct for self-preservation.\n        \n\n         \u201cWe\u2019re a farm-to-table American tapas restaurant,\u201d my server said one night. \u201cAll the food is small plates that you can share.\u201d In fact, many plates struck me as too small, even for one. The carrots, tiny and multicolored and al dente, tossed with oregano and bits of feta, come in a dish slightly bigger than a coffee lid. They cost $8, which in many restaurants would get you a side dish two or three times larger.\n        \n\n         A special of bay scallops with black-trumpet-mushroom pur\u00e9e was delicious, but there were six of them, and three of us. The price was $16. A $12 plate of eggs scrambled with smoked trout and fried bread worked out to about two forkfuls for each of us.\n        \n\n         These dishes were all sensitively made from great ingredients, but they were all a bit well-mannered for this style of dining. The best small plates cause a clamor. Sharing them provokes tension: Who\u2019s getting the last bite? That question came up with the wonderful little grilled cheese panini topped with a Spanish tomato-garlic-olive oil spread. And I could imagine arguing over the sea scallops and diced fried potatoes bathed in warm olive oil and spicy Aleppo pepper.\n        \n\n         But far more often, after a bite of, say, soft cauliflower in Cheddar sauce, or a mini-pizza with fried calamari over tomato sauce, or corned tongue with charred cabbage (really good) and Russian dressing (not quite as good), I would nod happily, and move on to the next thing.\n        \n\n         A single taste of some plates was too much. With its shrimp poppers \u2014 peculiarly bland fried shrimp stuffed with peculiarly bland crab and fish mousse \u2014 Telepan Local seemed to be trying to imitate Red Lobster and not quite succeeding. Fried watercress with cashews and chile sauce was an obvious homage to a Thai dish, yet it lacked the rippling energy of lime juice and fish sauce that any number of restaurants in\n         \n\n\n          Queens\n         \n         would have given it. Telepan Local\u2019s pigs in blankets, however, perfectly mimicked everybody else\u2019s pigs in blankets.\n        \n\n         Some of the best small-plates restaurants are glorified bars; picture tapas joints in\n         \n\n\n          Barcelona\n         \n         or\n         \n          izakayas in Tokyo\n         \n         or wine bars in\n         \n\n\n          Paris\n         \n         . Telepan Local looks at first as if it might fit the bill, with its long line of white barstools in an aggressively mirrored corridor up front. And the wine list is intriguing and affordable. But I had a hard time finding anybody who knew the bottles; one night my server couldn\u2019t tell me about any of the three Greek whites except the one poured by the glass.\n        \n\n         The cocktail list comes on strong, too. Most of the spirits are distilled locally; bitters are made on site. And I was surprised by the low-key sophistication of the Mai O Mai, a pineapple juice and rum concoction. The rest were too sweet, except for a gin and tonic that was too flat and a martini variant, the Jabberwocky, that was too warm.\n        \n\n         I had one of the worst desserts of the year at Telepan Local, a galette of underripe, undercooked pears on a gummy, doughy crust. I also had one of the best. Larissa Raphael, who pulls double duty as pastry chef here and at Telepan, has come up with a champion recipe for coconut cake that is rich like poundcake but lighter \u2014 poundcake that could fly.\n        \n\n         Maybe it can fly right out of this small-plates version of Telepan Local and into one that makes sense, not an American tapas restaurant but simply an American neighborhood restaurant. Some of the understated cooking that gets lost when it\u2019s shared by the whole table might, in more generous portions, make lovely appetizers or main courses for one.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 35, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/dining/restaurant-review-telepan-local-in-tribeca.html", "google_mag": 26.5}, {"review_text": "\n         Morten Sohlberg designed the tables for Blenheim, the West Village restaurant he and his wife opened in May. The concrete tops are polished smooth with beeswax, and the sides are edged with copper. The shapes look irregular, but the sides are slightly bowed so that a pair of two-tops can spoon against each other and become a four-top.\n        \n\n         \u201cThat\u2019s the idea, anyway,\u201d our server said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t all fit together.\u201d\n        \n\n         Blenheim is like that, too. A tremendous amount of thought and effort has gone into the food, drinks and design, but they don\u2019t always connect.\n        \n\n         This seems to have been an issue since the beginning. The first chef left about three weeks in because of what the owners called \u201cirreconcilable differences.\u201d In July, they hired Ryan Tate, who had been the chef at Le Restaurant in TriBeCa until it suddenly closed. I admired the $100 set menus he served there enough that I happily gave the place two stars\n         \n          in a review\n         \n         last year.\n        \n\n         Mr. Tate has set his ambitions even higher this time. Besides a sizable \u00e0 la carte menu, he offers a $115, nine-course tasting loaded with extra dishes. At times, his cooking is as thoughtful and transporting as it was at Le Restaurant, but with a higher degree of intricacy. At other times, the kitchen is obviously struggling to keep up. Meanwhile, the service runs the gamut from charming and slightly lost to nonexistent. On my first night there, the disparity between the two was the widest I had ever seen in any restaurant.\n        \n\n         That is not the only disconnect. When tables are set up outside next to the cobblestone streets, Blenheim looks as if its only desire is to be your drop-in-and-hang-out corner tavern. The dining room, with an antique tree saw, a wooden yoke and a whole array of carpentry tools on the walls, looks like the historical society of some upstate village, where it would be the only tourist attraction. Underlining the point, servers tell you right away that this is a farm-to-table restaurant, that ingredients are trucked in from\n         \n          Blenheim Hill Farm\n         \n         in Schoharie County, southwest of\n         \n\n\n          Albany\n         \n         , owned by Mr. Sohlberg and his wife, Min Ye. You might reasonably expect pork cutlets, creamed corn, maybe pie.\n        \n\n         Mr. Tate has other ideas. Terrific ideas, often, even if they have as much business in a rusticated farm-to-table tavern as white tie and spats.\n        \n\n         The stream in Schoharie County where tilefish and sea urchin splash around together hasn\u2019t been discovered yet, but at Blenheim they swim happily side by side on one plate. The tilefish falls into big, sweet white flakes that taste of shrimp. The urchin is whipped into a creamy, slightly briny sabayon that is like a richer, more luxurious taramosalata. Also on the plate are fat blueberries and carrots roasted in coffee bean oil. I can\u2019t explain why blueberries taste so good with sea urchin sabayon, but they do.\n        \n\n         Alaskan king crab meat had been made almost as sweet and tender as some tropical fruit, but the midnight funk of squid ink sauce brought it back to the sea. With dense roasted chanterelles and wands of naturally pickled sea bean scattered around the plate, this was an appetizer you could go quietly crazy over.\n        \n\n         And it would take a crazy person to complain that Alaskan crab and sea urchin are insufficiently farm-to-table when they\u2019re cooked this skillfully. Not that Mr. Tate turns his back on the owners\u2019 land entirely. The carrots and the chanterelles come from Blenheim Hill Farm. So does the pork loin, which is slowly roasted until it drips with juices and then sent to the table with a cast of cool Southern characters: pickled peaches, okra charred to a crisp husk, and sorghum syrup, like molasses cut with espresso.\n        \n\n         Those are Blenheim lettuces and crunchy chips of smoked Blenheim ham in the gloriously crisp and fresh salad, and that\u2019s creamy Blenheim pork fat spackling the side of the bowl. The lemon balm, thyme and pineapple sage in a sensational group of herb sorbets: Blenheim-grown.\n        \n\n         The gap between the farm-to-table ethos and Mr. Tate\u2019s style is minor compared with the gulf between the restaurant Blenheim could be and the restaurant that currently sits at 283 West 12th Street.\n        \n\n         The same dish can be stunning one night and a contorted mess on another.\n        \n\n         The first time I had the roasted king mushrooms with spaetzle and sauerkraut, the mushroom stems had something like the flavor and texture of weisswurst. A German-inspired vegetarian main course with mushrooms standing in for sausages is a fantastic notion, and I couldn\u2019t wait to taste it again when I returned. But when I did, the stems were watery inside and rubbery outside, like a steamed hot dog wrapped in a balloon. An unusual dessert soup of cooked barley and Champagne grapes in a chilled barley-jasmine tea went out of whack between visits, going from fascinating to weird. And there were glitches that were surprising in such a technique-focused kitchen. The grapefruit pearls with cured Tasmanian sea trout were meant to burst with juice, but they had solidified. Eating them was like chewing on the drippings of a grapefruit-scented candle.\n        \n\n         On Blenheim\u2019s better nights, I might have ranked the food among the most exciting and interesting I\u2019ve eaten in the last year. But it came to the table so very, very slowly that it was hard to stay excited or interested. It took more than three hours one night to order and eat appetizers, main courses and desserts. I wondered if the kitchen was overwhelmed. I was sure our server was.\n        \n\n         We had to flag him down to ask for more of the soft, warm and yeasty rolls made with Cheddar and Marmite. They never came. It took two tries and about 20 minutes to get a second glass of wine. We were left alone with menus for three-quarters of an hour before we waved like drowning sailors and begged him to take our order.\n        \n\n         \u201cThere are some additions to the menu tonight,\u201d he began.\n        \n\n         Additions? When the kitchen can\u2019t send out more than one course an hour, the menu needs subtractions. And Blenheim has no business offering nine-course tastings unless it is ready to provide pajamas and sleeping bags. Maybe its pieces would fit together better if there weren\u2019t so many of them. I hope so, because I\u2019d like to see it transform itself from a puzzle to a restaurant.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 36, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/22/dining/restaurant-review-blenheim-in-the-west-village.html", "google_mag": 21.600000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n         Years from now, when\n         \n\n\n          PBS\n         \n         runs its six-part documentary about\n         \n\n\n          David Chang\n         \n         , Roy Choi and the other American chefs who over the last decade have cracked open Asian cooking traditions and hosed down the pieces with pork fat, I hope an episode will be devoted to the triple pork triple garlic mazemen at Ivan Ramen.\n        \n\n         The camera will pan majestically across \u201cThe Art of the Slurp,\u201d Nathan Fox\u2019s manga-style strip that hangs over the counter and starts with a fat boy in a Batman mask snapping his chopsticks apart, as a narrator intones: \u201cIn 2014, Ivan Orkin, a\n         \n\n\n          Long Island\n         \n         native who grew famous cooking ramen in\n         \n\n\n          Tokyo\n         \n         , opened his flagship restaurant on the Lower East Side.\u201d\n        \n\n         The plucking of a samisen fades out; punk guitar chords clang; the screen is filled with a close-up of a noodle bowl. \u201cDeveloped in\n         \n\n\n          Japan\n         \n         around the turn of the 21st century, mazemen is a drier variation on ramen, more like pasta than soup. Mr. Orkin dressed fresh whole-wheat noodles with a slab of simmered pork belly, chopped bacon and enough pork-bone stock to moisten the noodles. Then came the garlic: raw, pickled and roasted.\u201d\n        \n\n         Cut to a heavyset, white-haired, unshaven, downtrodden man in pajamas, identified as a former restaurant critic for\n         \n\n\n          The New York Times\n         \n         . \u201cActually, there was a fourth pork and a fourth garlic in there,\u201d he says. \u201cGarlic oil and pork fat. Maybe Orkin thought \u2018quadruple pork\u2019 sounded too much like \u2018quadruple bypass.\u2019 Those ingredients could have gotten into a shouting match, but they were harmonious. It was like a summation of all the lard-wallowing and umami-slinging that had rippled through American food since the first drop of grease ran down the chin of the first customer who tried a Momofuku pork bun. I could eat a bowl of that mazemen right now, if they would let me have anything besides kale pellets.\u201d\n        \n\n         Get that old guy off the screen. He\u2019s bringing me down, though he\u2019s right about the triple pork triple garlic mazemen. It\u2019s an undeniably intense dish that shows how energetically and skillfully Mr. Orkin colors outside the lines of Japanese cuisine.\n        \n\n         Since Ivan Ramen opened in May, there is usually a line for the single restroom but rarely one to get in the door. Some of the pent-up steam in the ramen community may have escaped late last year, when Mr. Orkin opened Slurp Shop, in Gotham West Market. A quick-service counter with a noodle-dominated menu, Slurp Shop is a fine introduction to Mr. Orkin\u2019s ramen philosophy (essentially, make everything \u2014 noodles, broth, droplets of fat on the surface of the soup \u2014 better), but not to his full breadth as a chef. For that, you need to go to Ivan Ramen, where he invests in creativity well outside the scope of standard ramenyas. Mr. Orkin supplements the noodles with dishes that cover many bases, though not the sweet one just yet. Desserts are promised down the line.\n        \n\n         As suggested by a dining-room collage made of hundreds of pictures of Asian and Western pop icons and foodstuffs, Mr. Orkin\u2019s cultural allusions are quick and funny, and come from several directions at once. He makes a whacked-out vegetarian chili dog with fried tofu in place of the frank, a rich and intense stew of mushrooms and miso as the chili, and a squiggly line of American yellow mustard. (There\u2019s no substitute for yellow mustard.) Called a Tofu Coney Island, it\u2019s a joke that tastes great. That was true for the JFC, too: deep-fried chicken hearts and livers with a honey-mustard sauce that tasted similar enough to the traditional McNugget garnish to make me laugh, and different enough (sharper, stronger and enriched with ponzu) to make me want more.\n        \n\n         The Japanese borrowed ramen from\n         \n\n\n          China\n         \n         , and Mr. Orkin keeps up the custom. There is steamed Chinese broccoli with soy-pickled garlic, as well as a salad of crunchy daikon threads topped with spicy, funky XO sauce. On tables that could become laden with pork very quickly, each was a cool, welcome oasis.\n        \n\n         The pork tended to disappear as quickly as it arrived. True, the scrapple waffle, a takeoff on Japanese okonomiyaki, hadn\u2019t moved beyond the gimmick stage; it was all crisp, bland surface without the peculiar bits of fat and face that excite scrapple fans and terrify everybody else.\n        \n\n         But the improbably fluffy tofu-pork meatballs catapulted themselves into my mouth at the slightest encouragement, and little do-it-yourself handrolls of nori spread with sushi rice and pulled roast pork, as slick and rich as carnitas, were gone almost before I noticed the bright, sweet-sour relief they got from roasted tomatoes.\n        \n\n         As our server promised, roasted tomato performed the same favor for a cheese mazemen, a kind of Japanese alfredo. Servers at Ivan Ramen are always pushing add-on garnishes for the noodles for an extra $2 or $3. \u201cAll our ramens are improved by an egg,\u201d we were told one night. If Mr. Orkin thinks his ramen is better with an egg, he should put an egg on it, and charge accordingly.\n        \n\n         Value is a sticky issue with ramen. Because it is served in a minute and eaten almost as quickly, it seems to call for fast-\n         \n\n\n          food prices\n         \n         . It takes more than a minute to prepare, though, particularly at Ivan Ramen, where the noodles are made in the kitchen from rye or whole-wheat flour. Springy and hearty, they are exceptional. The broths are painstakingly simmered until their flavors are deep and focused, particularly in the vegetarian ramen\u2019s soy-mushroom stock and the shio ramen\u2019s base of dashi stirred into a golden chicken soup that a grandmother might want to steal\n         \n\n\n          credit\n         \n         for.\n        \n\n         The most expensive ramen is $15, or $17 with the suggested egg. The mazemens, a form Mr. Orkin has mastered more fully than anyone in the city, justify the price. (The red-hot cold mazemen, dressed with salty, spicy sesame and accessorized with two prawns, should settle any doubts.)\n        \n\n         The soup ramens do not, at least not yet. Several times, the broth arrived well below the scalding heat that gives ramen its temporal dimension, as you race to eat the noodles before they go from slightly undercooked to al dente to overdone. The soups at Ivan Ramen barely changed, so there was no rush, no need to illustrate the art of the slurp. Maybe mine sat too long in the kitchen. The ramens shouldn\u2019t stop just short of the finish line when so many other items on the menu sail right over it.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 37, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/dining/restaurant-review-ivan-ramen.html", "google_mag": 19.600000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n         \u201cYou like spicy?\u201d Jimmy Lau asked from behind the counter at\n         \n          Shuko\n         \n         , the new restaurant just below Union Square where he and his partner, Nick Kim, prepare an elevated and memorable species of Japanese food. Before I could answer, he handed me a spicy tuna roll that would casually knock over my ideas about spicy tuna rolls, and spice, and tuna.\n        \n\n         Pickled red Thai chiles sat on top of the roll, chopped to bits and ready for action. The tuna underneath was soft sinew cut from the belly of a bluefin.

The heat comes in gusts that keep getting stronger until you can\u2019t do anything but hold on. The chiles scour your tongue, cauterizing it. The melting oils from the tuna belly blanket your entire mouth, trying to restore the peace.

Neta, though excellent, had a well-defined comfort zone right from the start. Compared with Shuko it looks like a restaurant on training wheels. Meanwhile, Mr. Takayama\u2019s operations, particularly now that the\n         \n          overpriced and underperforming Kappo Masa\n         \n         has been added to the fold, have begun to look like assembly lines where golden hooks are baited with two- and three-figure delicacies to dangle before whales. (Would you like the truffle maki roll topped with caviar or the caviar roll topped with truffles?)\n        \n\n         Those and other guaranteed bell-ringers do put in appearances at Shuko. Fat-streaked tuna belly, prone on a bed of rice, was one in a long volley of sushi pieces chosen by the chefs, at a cost of $135. Toro appeared again in the $175 kaiseki meal, a string of mesmerizing little plates followed by a shorter sushi recital. This time it took the shape of a homage to Mr. Takayama, a pure and tightly chilled tartare under a green-gray hump of Osetra caviar. During the five minutes or so it took to smear this on toasted milk bread and eat it, no force on earth could have stopped me short of hot lava flowing under the front door, and even then I would have made a guess at its speed before deciding to get up from the counter.\n        \n\n         What\u2019s impressive about Shuko, though, is how many times the chefs ring the bells without resorting to clich\u00e9d indulgences. One of the most memorable pieces of nigiri in my sushi omakase was an intense, livery, chewy bite of squab cartilage with sansho pepper. Another was a slab of Mediterranean dorade so rich and fatty it reminded me of shrimp. Another was simply a grilled shiitake cap folded around a pinch of warm rice.\n        \n\n         On the kaiseki menu another night, finely shredded Japanese mountain yam, burdock and carrot had been flattened with slivers of scallop beard to make a crisp, airy, hand-held latke.\n        \n\n         Toward the middle of both meals, a chef began to lay down pickle slices, silently, one after another, like a blackjack dealer. Shuko had piled these carrots, radishes and so forth into wood barrels to ferment when they were still in season, not just to save their flavor but to expand it.\n        \n\n\n\n\n          New York State\n         \n         produce preserved by traditional Japanese methods makes a fine emblem for Shuko\u2019s blending of cultures. Another may be the facade on East 12th Street, where the windowless wall is finished with sand and particles of hay, and the door is marked only by a handful of dried flowers tied with a string. It could be an ancient house in\n         \n\n\n          Tokyo\n         \n         , if not for the classic New York cast-iron column running right down the middle.\n        \n\n         Open the door and you enter what could be downtown\u2019s latest version of cocktail hide-outs like Angel\u2019s Share or Milk & Honey. And in fact, once you sit down at the long and carefully buffed ash bar, a bartender in a beard and necktie will offer to stir up a drink for you. This is an offer worth accepting. Another server, in ripped bluejeans, pours house-made sparkling water. The music is very slightly louder than in most sushi bars and spans the decades from\n         \n\n\n          Debbie Harry\n         \n         to Sky Ferreira. Ice Cube is having a good day, but Lorde is over getting told to throw her hands up in the air.\n        \n\n         Some purists may feel that all this desecrates the temple of sushi. They can go eat in a temple. Mr. Lau and Mr. Kim, both young and fluent in several cultures at once, have taken all the preciousness out of omakase and kaiseki dining and replaced it with a relaxed, sophisticated cool. They were already moving in this direction at Neta, but with Shuko they\u2019ve arrived. Everybody seems to feel comfortable here. (Some feel a little too comfortable; one night, a couple who seemed to have been married for several centuries carried on a long and inscrutable argument, while a young tycoon at the opposite end of the bar rattled off his company\u2019s revenue figures for the last five years.)\n        \n\n         Both menus offer an in-depth look at how good these two chefs are at bringing out flavors without appearing to be doing much to them. My sushi omakase, but not my kaiseki meals, included a flight of sea urchin, starting with pale, creamy blobs from\n         \n\n\n          Santa Barbara\n         \n         , Calif., then moving to\n         \n\n\n          Monterey\n         \n         , where the lobes were more compact and had a cleaner sweetness, and ending with uni topped with a lacy swirl of shirako tempura, the hot and buttery seminal fluid of a cod.\n        \n\n         The kaiseki doesn\u2019t delve as intimately into marine biology, but in recompense it offers a slightly wider variety of surprises. One of them is an ending too good to give away, a dessert that is so unluxurious and un-Japanese and wonderful that the chefs seem to be smiling to themselves every time it\u2019s served.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 39, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/dining/restaurant-review-shuko-in-the-east-village.html", "google_mag": 26.399999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n         It is as colorful and otherworldly as a coral reef, this row of fried cauliflower knobs in purple, ivory and marigold yellow. Wrapping each floret is a pale-gold skin of batter. It\u2019s almost invisible, but you feel it as you bite, its soft snap reinforced by the full-on crunch of chopped almonds. Poached before it is fried, the cauliflower is nicely salted all the way down to its tender core, but it is still cauliflower, so it needs a little support. This is supplied by a lush green tomatillo, pistachio and fresh herb sauce that gets in a quick, peppery jab before it signs off.\n        \n\n         Where does this dish come from? In the proximate sense, it is from Andrew Carmellini\u2019s latest restaurant,\n         \n          Little Park\n         \n         , inside the Smyth hotel in TriBeCa. The ultimate inspiration, though \u2014 where is that from? The batter is related to tempura, and I think I might have caught the rustle of\n         \n\n\n          Mexico\n         \n         in the sauce. Beyond that, it is hard to say. The fried cauliflower seems to be one of those dishes that happen when a chef\u2019s imagination is allowed to roam.\n        \n\n         Mr. Carmellini once dreamed of owning an Italian, a French and an American restaurant. In less than four years, starting with\n         \n          Locanda Verde\n         \n         in 2009, he and his partners built all three. Then, after\n         \n          the Dutch\n         \n         and\n         \n          Lafayette\n         \n         , he knocked out a fourth, a drop-in pasta place called\n         \n          Bar Primi\n         \n         that seemed to come together in less time than it takes the rest of us to watch a cat video on\n         \n\n\n          Facebook\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         Since becoming his own boss, in other words, Mr. Carmellini has cooked in and around the traditions of one country or another. At\n         \n\n\n          Little Park\n         \n         , he and his chef de cuisine, Min Kong, the executive sous chef at Carbone until last year, are working out their ideas from scratch. This may be why the best dishes there seem more fresh, natural and intuitive than what\u2019s on his other menus and why Little Park has less in common with Locanda Verde than it does with forward-leaning places like\n         \n          Estela\n         \n         or even the modern-Mexican\n         \n          Cosme\n         \n         . It is Mr. Carmellini\u2019s most contemporary restaurant. In a sense, it\u2019s his first.\n        \n\n         In the modern fashion, most dishes are of roughly the same size and complexity. There are no second-class ingredients and almost no side dishes. The vegetables are as intriguing as the animals on plates, like steamed black bass with bracingly vinegared lentils or the intensely beefy hanger steak under broccoli whose thin stems had been judiciously charred.\n        \n\n         Beets are, insistently, the point of the earthy and velvety risotto made from them, although cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and goat cheese do put extra wiggle in its walk. Flowers and shaved bull\u2019s-eyes of Chioggia beets on top keep the shockingly red plate from looking like a crime scene.\n        \n\n         It\u2019s a lucky carrot that ends up in Ms. Kong\u2019s kitchen; rarely is the vegetable lavished with so much attention. Some are roasted to a smoky sweetness, some are juiced and whipped into an airy orange custard, and still more are slivered into ribbons. All are flattered by the molasses notes in sticky black garlic and by a patch of cocoa nibs and toasted crumbs.\n        \n\n         At lunch, Mr. Carmellini and Ms. Kong send a stunning little sandwich down the runway, a celery root schnitzel with creamy, incisive mustard and apple-brussels sprout slaw on a sesame-seed bun. The celery root is not the most flavorful I\u2019ve had, but it is soft in all the right ways, augmented by generous bookends of golden breading. I ate one and wanted another.\n        \n\n         Another small marvel: the first worthwhile spaghetti squash I\u2019ve ever met. It was baked with garlic and a stealthy dose of lobster butter and upstaged the protein it was meant to support, half of a tiny lobster tail that wasn\u2019t warm enough to melt the herb butter slapped on top.\n        \n\n         There was other evidence of inattentiveness, like the oily mop of oversauced whole-wheat spaghetti with cabbage and red wattle pork. (The menu calls the poor hog \u201cred waddle.\u201d No doubt it was a large animal, but why add insult to injury?)\n        \n\n         Little Park\u2019s servers also push the popular contemporary con that small plates are meant for sharing. As one of my dinner guests remarked, \u201cThat\u2019s like saying: \u2018This is a studio apartment. It\u2019s perfect for a family.\u2019\u00a0\u201d I know I wanted more than one of the frilly kale-filled ravioli sitting on a sauce of sweet roasted winter squash.\n        \n\n         In most other ways, though, servers are poised and helpful. They are quick to demystify the peculiar cocktails, like the gin sour dusted with beet powder, and the even more peculiar wine list. Josh Nadel, the beverage director for Mr. Carmellini\u2019s restaurant group, has divided bottles by topography (\u201criver valleys,\u201d \u201clakes and slopes,\u201d \u201cmountains and terraces\u201d). This is an illuminating way to learn about viticulture, but it\u2019s a confusing way to find a red that goes with duck. Additional subdivisions into light-, medium- and full-bodied are easier to grasp.\n        \n\n         A bit of explanation may also be required with some of Jennifer Luk\u2019s desserts. What is frozen lemon fluff? It\u2019s a delicious white block of dense citrus meringue around which orange sections and candied ginger can happily revolve. How about cinnamon toast ice cream? It\u2019s something like crushed Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal sprinkled over ice cream that tastes like sweet bread, and it\u2019s as charming as it sounds. As for the \u201cwinter sundae\u201d of apple and beer, it\u2019s slightly more charming than it sounds, but maybe not quite enough more.\n        \n\n         When you think of Mr. Carmellini\u2019s restaurants, quiet and civility are not the first qualities that come to mind. Little Park has them. Desert-toned fabrics seem to soak up excess noise in a dining room designed by\n         \n          Gachot Studios\n         \n         that walks the line between midcentury chic and expense-account bland. Anyone who has faced down the unwelcoming committee at the door of Locanda Verde, or showed up on time at Lafayette only to be sent to the bar, or waited on the Bowery to get into Bar Primi, will appreciate the more hospitable greeting at Little Park. Some of my guests, arriving early for a 9 p.m. table, were already seated when I showed up. The calm atmosphere may be the least fashionable thing about Little Park.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 40, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/25/dining/restaurant-review-little-park-in-tribeca.html", "google_mag": 28.399999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n         Can a restaurant still succeed when it fails at what it says it wants to do?\n        \n\n         This is not a question critics ask every day. But then the place in question,\n         \n          Eleven Madison Park\n         \n         , is not a restaurant where most of us would or could eat every day.\n        \n\n         This, in fact, is one of the sticky issues raised by the drastic changes its two driving spirits, Daniel Humm and Will Guidara, have made since its last review in\n         \n\n\n          The New York Times\n         \n         , in 2009. Back then, when Frank Bruni\n         \n          promoted it to four stars\n         \n         from three, most customers still selected three courses from Mr. Humm\u2019s menu at a cost of $88. Today, lunch or dinner is $225 for more than a dozen courses. All but two are typically chosen by the kitchen. A few days in advance of a recent reservation, the head ma\u00eetre d\u2019hotel, Justin Roller, sent an email warning, \u201cOur tasting menu lasts approximately three and a half hours, so please plan your day accordingly.\u201d The last time I got a message like that, it was from my doctor, shortly before my\n         \n\n\n          colonoscopy\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         Meals at Eleven Madison now cost more, take longer and offer less variety from one week to the next. As might have been predicted, this took the restaurant out of regular rotation for many locals. Perhaps to make up for the loss of actual New Yorkers in the dining room, Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidara turned the restaurant into a\n         \n          theme park about the city\n         \n         . In its very early days in 2012, the result was the most ridiculous meal I\u2019ve ever had.\n        \n\n         Nearly every course began with a clunky, humorless history lesson about steakhouses, appetizing stores, clambakes, cheesecakes and even Times Square scam artists. The patter overshadowed and undermined the food. Notably, it had no voice, in a city full of them. \u201cThree-card monte is now illegal, but along the same lines, we had a deck of cards made for us,\u201d my server recited, before doing a magic trick. I never figured out how it was done, but the greater mystery was just why a restaurant charging hundreds of dollars for such kitsch would want to lecture diners about \u201chustlers and scammers.\u201d\n        \n\n         Some of this gab has been dropped, but not all. Even now, when any ingredient is grown in\n         \n\n\n          New York State\n         \n         , someone is sure to point it out. Hang on, New York has farms? And chefs can cook their stuff just like the ingredients I get at the supermarket? Wait, I need to write this down. Constantly mentioning the region only underlines the shallowness of Eleven Madison Park\u2019s approach to it. (A server announced that the oysters grew \u201cupstate\u201d in Greenport, N.Y., which will be news to Long Islanders.) Mr. Humm doesn\u2019t dig down into the natural and cultivated landscape of his region the way, say, Christopher Kostow, Sean Brock and Dan Barber do. He practices entry-level locavorism.\n        \n\n         Objections like this buzzed before my eyes so insistently that at times they blinded me to what was going on in the soaring Art Deco space across from Madison Square Park. Which was: a roomful of people almost goofy with happiness. The woman dining alone with her camera shyly accepting an invitation into the vast and gleaming kitchen for a special course prepared a few inches in front of her; the couple watching, as if seeing their first sunrise, a sommelier who removed a cork by melting the bottle\u2019s neck with red-hot tongs; the guests at my table going limp as they tasted a crazily good braised pork collar and cheek in a dark sauce that was like pig marmalade; and finally even me, the overthinking picker of\n         \n\n\n          nits\n         \n         and finder of faults. Under the restaurant\u2019s relentless, skillful campaign to spread joy, I gave in.\n        \n\n         What Eleven Madison feeds your intellect can have the value of junk food, but what it feeds your mouth, stomach and spirit is something else. The restaurant tries as hard as any I know to bring delight to the table with every course. It succeeds so often that only the most determinedly grumpy souls could resist. Even the spoken intros have a role. They serve to tee up the surprises that emerge from the kitchen, which reliably turn skeptics into swooners, especially as Mr. Humm has axed some of his sillier gimmicks. (Back to Times Square with you, three-card monte.)\n        \n\n         More crucially to this restaurant\u2019s intent, the patter opens a window between customers and staff. The dopey speeches work like pickup lines; you may smirk, but at least you respond, and once you\u2019ve done that, a conversation can start.\n        \n\n         Mr. Guidara, a front-of-house man who rose to become Mr. Humm\u2019s business partner in the restaurant when it broke off from the Union Square Hospitality Group, is a creative partner, too, working to establish a loose, entertaining tone in the dining room that sets Eleven Madison Park apart from its competitors. The servers are deeply attentive to details. As a manager told\n         \n          New York magazine\n         \n         , \u201cIt takes 10 months to learn how to pour water.\u201d\n        \n\n         The remote formality that typically comes with punctilious service has been banished. Servers want to make you an active collaborator in the fun. As Bacall said to Bogart, it\u2019s even better when you help.\n        \n\n         At the center of the collaboration is, of course, Mr. Humm\u2019s cooking. He is, at heart, a neo-classicist, a master of pruning the old-fashioned curlicues from the traditional haute cuisine of his training to make the pleasures more modern and direct. This isn\u2019t always clear when he is trying to keep up with path-blazing chefs like\n         \n          Grant Achatz\n         \n         and\n         \n          Ren\u00e9 Redzepi\n         \n         . But it\u2019s the force that drives his best innovations, like globes of celery root braised in a pig\u2019s bladder, inspired by the classic French dish poulet en vessie.\n        \n\n         The white globes will be bathed in a truffled chicken reduction and set beside a circle of celery root pur\u00e9e that has been spooned over, guess what, more truffles. And Mr. Humm, always alert to opportunities for spectacle, knows that beyond forming an airtight vessel for steam, an inflated pig\u2019s bladder shimmying around a copper saut\u00e9 pan makes a great conversation piece in the dining room.\n        \n\n         Recently, the cheese course packed into a picnic basket was retired. A fondue has taken its place, and it is both homey and spectacular. The serving bowl is a baked carnival squash and the utensil a hot, soft pretzel stick from the protean pastry kitchen. There is no homily about the glories of the street-corner pretzel cart. You are left alone to revel in the melted cheese, to mash the pretzel against cubes of sweet squash, and to imagine anything you like. I decided to imagine that the fondue came straight out of Mr. Humm\u2019s upbringing in\n         \n\n\n          Switzerland\n         \n         , because it worked on my senses with the deep, soulful pull of a childhood memory.\n        \n\n         There are no printed menus at the start of the meal, just a conversation led by the table\u2019s captain. Once\n         \n\n\n          allergies\n         \n         and aversions are out of the way, two choices remain. One concerns the main course; the other is about foie gras. Mr. Humm is a virtuosic handler of fattened duck liver, so either the hot or cold version is likely to produce altered states of consciousness. He brings out foie gras\u2019s sweet and silky traits by layering it with braised red cabbage and serving it in a chilled wedge that looks like a slice of marbled Bundt cake; its meatier and robust qualities come through in a seared slice under fried brussels sprout leaves and smoked eel.\n        \n\n         Many people will choose no foie gras at all. I don\u2019t know what you can give a meat-avoider to make her feel she\u2019s not missing out as her dinner partner goes bug-eyed over foie gras, but the watermelon and goat cheese salad served to a guest of mine last fall was definitely not it. So much attention goes into the showstoppers that substitutions do not always measure up.\n        \n\n         By now, a more glamorous alternative may be in the wings. Many things are in the wings at this restaurant, which is defined above all by its fluid movement into the future. The New York theme may wind down, though I hope the manhattan cart stays, stocked with mixers for the classic cocktail and its five variants to be stirred up at your elbow. Whatever new theme rolls to the table after that may be only partly baked, like the initial New York menu, but Eleven Madison Park\u2019s true theme will stay the same: convincing you that you\u2019ve been lifted to some better world until the man in the top hat outside whistles for your cab.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 41, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/18/dining/restaurant-review-eleven-madison-park-in-midtown-south.html", "google_mag": 28.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n            A critic could run out of new ways to express disappointment in\n            \n             Altamarea Group restaurants\n            \n            if Altamarea didn\u2019t keep coming up with new ways to disappoint.\n           \n\n            Disappointment requires hope, and there are reasons to hope for great things from the latest Altamarea production,\n            \n             Vaucluse\n            \n            .

With Vaucluse, Mr. Gadbaw gets to dig around in a fresh patch of dirt.\n           \n\n            Vaucluse does not try to give us a view of contemporary French cooking the way\n            \n             Rebelle\n            \n            or\n            \n             Racines NY\n            \n            do. Much of the menu lassos the grayest of old gray mares and drags them out for one last trot around the paddock. Some of the mares are revived by the exercise. Others, like the chocolate mousse that has been repeatedly violated by bits of baked cocoa meringue and buried under chocolate ice cream, seem as if they would rather be left alone to live out their retirements in peace.\n           \n\n            Depending on how you order, Vaucluse can be superb, quietly competent or oddly off kilter. The chilled roasted leeks are a virtually perfect appetizer, gorgeously soft and stripped of all raw-onion harshness; as counterpoints, the sprinkle of almonds and the whole-grain mustard vinaigrette, not too pungent, are just right.\n           \n\n            Chicken soup, which we usually save for nights when we need to crawl under the covers, is, at Vaucluse, a reason to get dressed up and go out. Tiny elegant gnocchi bob around in a deeply flavored, lip-smacking velout\u00e9; cream is piled on top just in case it\u2019s not rich enough.\n           \n\n\n             Tournedos Rossini\n            \n            make a glorious comeback in the form of beefy-red roasted veal tenderloin in a truffled veal jus. The veal sits next to an innocent-looking rectangle that turns out to be sliced black truffles between slices of bread crisped in butter. On top of this voluptuous little sandwich is a lobe of seared foie gras.\n           \n\n            The p\u00e2t\u00e9 of pork and duck inside a soft pastry crust is impeccably traditional. As far as I know, there is no precedent in French tradition for Vaucluse\u2019s \u00e9paulettes, double-barreled ravioli with rabbit confit and Swiss chard loaded into one barrel and reblochon in the other. They will set their own precedent, because they are preposterously good.\n           \n\n            The technical work on all these dishes is impressive, but they come to life because a light bulb went off in somebody\u2019s head. In other regions of the menu, the wattage dims.\n           \n\n            The magnificently simple combination of red wine sauce and a poached egg known as oeuf en meurette has been complicated so much that it\u2019s no fun anymore. The egg is trapped inside a ring of roasted delicata squash, and the sauce has been reduced to a sticky, sharp and slightly too-salty syrup.\n           \n\n            The poulet r\u00f4ti grand-m\u00e8re is dull enough to make you wonder if Grandmother learned to roast chickens at a hotel school, although it comes with a profoundly appealing ballotine that\u2019s something like a chicken-and-foie-gras meatball wrapped in skin.\n           \n\n            The potato tart is a jumble of sliced fingerlings, lardons, bits of Camembert and truffles waiting for something to happen. Nothing is going to happen as long as they\u2019re all loafing on a crackerlike crust that you could safely serve to a patient on a no-flavor diet.\n           \n\n            If all you ask of a pork chop is for it to be round, pink and wet, the one at Vaucluse will meet your requirements.\n           \n\n            Many dishes land somewhere between inspired and depleted. At the happier end of that spectrum is the duck \u00e0 l\u2019orange for two, which features a fine if somewhat over-reduced sauce and a phenomenal cap of evenly golden skin. Why two people need to order a sliced duck breast is a question I can\u2019t answer. How the price was pegged at $92 is another; the huge gratin of turnips and broccoli that is part of the deal doesn\u2019t quite get you to $46 a person.\n           \n\n            The pogo-stick vicissitudes of Vaucluse intensify with the stabs at classic desserts made by Alina Martell in collaboration with Robert Truitt, who oversees pastries at all the Altamarea restaurants. I would have kept sinking my spoon into the dark-chocolate souffl\u00e9 until it was gone if the other people at the table had let me. It was a pleasure to see the scalloped ring of a Paris-Brest, and it would have been even more of a pleasure to eat if the pastry had been crisper.\n           \n\n            But look out. The caramelized mille-feuille was deeply uninteresting, the buckwheat crust of the mixed-fruit tart rested on a drift of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche custard as salty as feta, and one night a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e had been cooked so hard it curdled. It came with a little dish of berries with mint leaves under powdered sugar, the way Belgian waffles are served at an ambitious bed-and-breakfast.\n           \n\n            Seeing the meal crumple at the last course was the most disappointing thing of all, because the desserts I ate at Costata and Ristorante Morini were precisely turned adventures.\n           \n\n            It must be a challenge feeding the trim and carefully dressed people who fill the two handsome, proper dining rooms when so many of the recipes seem to contain the instruction \u201cFold the butter into the butter.\u201d A dizzying slick of it clung to the egg noodles that came with the boeuf bourguignon and the coq au vin, each very well made and rich enough on its own.\n           \n\n            Perhaps to make things up to us, we were asked if we would like the trout Grenobloise served with the brown butter \u2014 the whole point of the dish \u2014 on the side.\n           \n\n            Vaucluse is comfortable and reassuring enough that it will almost certainly find an audience on the Upper East Side. It\u2019s far from a bad restaurant. It\u2019s just not, as my teachers used to say, using its full potential.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 43, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/02/dining/vaucluse-review.html", "google_mag": 26.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n\n             Ichiran\n            \n            , a Japanese ramen chain that touched down in Brooklyn last fall, makes one kind of soup, the opaque ivory pork broth called tonkotsu. Like a heart surgeon who operates only on the left ventricle, it has staked out a niche within a niche.\n           \n\n            Within its microspecialty, though, Ichiran presents you with a boggling number of decisions. The first comes before the menu, and it will determine what kind of restaurant you eat in. When you walk in from Johnson Avenue, one of those Bushwick streets that runs along blank walls that hide disquieting postindustrial scars, you\u2019re asked if you would rather sit in a booth or at a table.\n           \n\n            This is an easy choice. The tables are arranged in a bright room with red paper lanterns, promotional posters and a television in the corner. It will do if you came with a group, but it is as special as the nicer restaurants in Penn Station.\n           \n\n            The booths, on the other hand, aren\u2019t like anything else in town. There are two long rows of them separated by a long alley where the servers work. The booths are separated from this backstage area by bamboo shades and one another by hinged partitions. When the partitions were shut and the shades were down, I was all by myself. I couldn\u2019t decide if it felt more like a library carrel, a peep show or a confessional. (\u201cMy child, how long has it been since you last slurped a noodle?\u201d)\n           \n\n            According to the company, which has around 60 locations in Japan, these are \u201cflavor concentration booths.\u201d In the closed position, the partitions did seem to keep the sweet-smelling steam that rises off the soup from wandering away on currents of air. I could soak in the aroma even when my head wasn\u2019t bent over the bowl.\n           \n\n            The effect was minimal, though, and I wondered if the thing that was supposed to be doing the concentrating was me.\n           \n\n            The signs tacked up all over the place were distracting, though. There is even one taped to the restroom wall explaining that Ichiran\u2019s owner is determined never to run out of toilet paper. The wall is already covered with toilet paper rolls, but a few extra sheets are tucked behind the note, in case of emergency.\n           \n\n            One of the many signs inside the booth read, \u201cFlavor Concentration in progress \u2014 please be quiet and silence your phones.\u201d In theory, you could eat a whole meal at Ichiran with no human contact. The menu is a checklist. A laminated card signals that you want a water refill. The paper wrapper on the chopsticks doubles as an order form for extra noodles if you finish the ones in the bowl. Leave one of them by the red call button, press it, and a server rolls up the shade to take away your order.\n           \n\n            All of this may happen wordlessly in Japan. In New York, we talk. Almost every time the shade went up, a server bent over to peer through the opening, which is at the height of a belt buckle, to chat about my order.\n           \n\n            One night, just after I sat down, the screen went up, and a hand stretched toward me. Without thinking, I held out mine, and we shook. Anxiety flushed through me. Had I broken ramen protocol? Was this like reaching over the front seat of a car to give an Uber driver a neck rub?\n           \n\n            I recovered from my shame and started filling out the menu with check marks and circles. How strong did I want the broth? How rich with melted pork fat \u2014 a few isolated slicks coasting on top of the soup, or a layer thick as frosting on a cupcake? Would I like chopped scallions or not? How about cha-shu, thin slices of marinated pork? Extra cha-shu on the side? No chopped garlic, a pile of garlic, or something in between?\n           \n\n            Should my noodles be soft on arrival, or firm because they\u2019d get to keep cooking in the hot soup? Finally, did I want any of Ichiran\u2019s proprietary spice mixture dropped on top, and if so, how much? Would a few pinpricks of fire do, or should I make the broth so incendiary that I would have to reach for the tissues mounted on the wall behind me?\n           \n\n            All these decisions would be pointless, of course, if the ramen were not very good. It is. Whether you will prefer it to the majestically potent tonkotsu at\n            \n             Mu Ramen\n            \n            or the memorably savory one at\n            \n             Ippudo\n            \n            , I can\u2019t say. But it is rounded and substantial, moving across the mouth with the glide and density of extralight coffee. The flavor is very porky without any of the unnerving butcher-shop note that creeps into some tonkotsus. I was never served a bowl that was less than painfully hot, which is the ideal.\n           \n\n            One edge Ichiran holds over\n            \n             its competitors\n            \n            is that you can give what you consider the correct answer to all of those questions. For the record, my preferences after a few rounds of experimentation are: broth of medium richness and strength; yes to scallions and the standard, free portion of cha-shu (it is less flavorful than at some other places, the meat less generous with jiggly streaks of fat); a smallish dab of garlic; and firm but not \u201cextra firm\u201d noodles, which are straight and skinny, like spaghetti.\n           \n\n            The spice blend is called hiden no tare, which translates as \u201csecret sauce.\u201d Supposedly only four people know the recipe. This coarse, rust-colored paste adds more than heat; after it sits in the soup for a while, the broth takes on a toasted flavor that sometimes reminded me of roasted peanuts. The amount I asked for varied based on how badly my head required banging that day. I stopped short of a full skull-shattering dose, but it\u2019s reassuring to know I can get it when the need arises.\n           \n\n            These basic options don\u2019t change the cost of the soup, $18.90. Tips are not accepted, which brings the price into line with, say,\n            \n             Ivan Ramen\n            \n            or Ippudo. Ichiran\u2019s ramen can become one of the most expensive in town, though, if you add toppings like a cooked egg, squares of dried nori or wood ear mushrooms, which come with extra charges.\n           \n\n            Those who, like me, enjoy semiliquid yolks in their ramen will not want the egg, which is solid all the way through. The only garnish I was happy to spend more money for was the little pitcher of vinegar for $1.90. It has a soft, somewhat oxidized bite, like that of aged sherry vinegar, and it brings definition to the blunt contours of the pork broth.\n           \n\n            There is one dessert, an almond-tofu pudding glazed with matcha. The only other dish, strips of simmered pork belly, can be eaten with a bowl of white rice. The pork was good enough to pad my stomach, but when hunger is my concern, I\u2019ll go for a supplementary coil of noodles. Crouched in my booth, I\u2019ll practice my slurp, and when hot droplets of soup fly everywhere, nobody will get spattered but me.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 44, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/dining/ichiran-review-ramen-brooklyn.html", "google_mag": 25.899999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n            After\n            \n             Tabla\n            \n            , Floyd Cardoz doesn\u2019t owe New York anything. In his 11 years as the chef of that restaurant across from Madison Square Park, he used the language of Indian cuisine to say things we had never heard before.\n           \n\n            A native of Mumbai, he showed us that the Indian spice cabinet can perform many other tricks besides curry. Upstairs at Tabla, he helped end the era in which the fine-dining wing of the restaurant business operated as a club to which cuisines of non-European descent need not apply. At the bottom of the winding staircase, in the little lounge known as Bread Bar, he showed us that a serious chef could pull off a more affordable and accessible menu without pandering.\n           \n\n            Restaurants that change people\u2019s perceptions don\u2019t come along very often, though. So in assessing Mr. Cardoz\u2019s new restaurant,\n            \n             Paowalla\n            \n            , it\u2019s more productive to view the things it does well (and there are a lot) as a bonus, without getting caught up in the ways in which it doesn\u2019t quite live up to Tabla.\n           \n\n            The next two jobs Mr. Cardoz held in New York after Tabla closed in 2010 took him away from Indian cooking. In theory,\n            \n             North End Grill\n            \n            and White Street could have set him free. In practice, neither gave free rein to his talents.\n           \n\n            Luckily for him and for us, he is his own boss at Paowalla, and he\u2019s cooking Indian food again. Reaching into his back catalog, Mr. Cardoz is serving some dishes and even a couple of cocktails, like the mind-clearing cucumber-gin highball called the Kachumber Cooler, that are flashbacks to Tabla and Bread Bar.\n           \n\n            He found a corner spot in SoHo that used to be an Italian restaurant. The wood-fueled pizza oven in the middle of the dining room was a stroke of luck, fitting in with the theme that also led to the name. Paowalla means bread seller, and breads lead the menu. They come in many shapes and sizes, from the familiar standards like naans and rotis to more exotic forms.\n           \n\n            Pao are yeasted dinner rolls, a Portuguese-derived specialty of Goa with a slight, charming sweetness. (If you grew up with Parker house rolls, you want to drop a pat of butter on them.) The white spirals called tingmo are Tibetan steamed buns, which Mr. Cardoz treats like cinnamon rolls with chile paste where the cinnamon should be.\n           \n\n            Rosemary naan had almost no rosemary flavor, and naan stuffed with minced bacon wasn\u2019t as irresistible as it should have been. But the kulcha filled with Cheddar was improbably wonderful.\n           \n\n            I understand why Mr. Cardoz has put the breads at the top of the batting order on his menu. But I think his policy of automatically serving them first, with nothing but chutneys to accompany them, is a mistake. These breads deserve to be on the table in the company of other food. They\u2019re a little lonely on their own.\n           \n\n            A lot of the menu is made up of small plates, many of them snacklike and many served with bread, to the benefit of both bread and snack. The melting roasted bone marrow is terrific spread on sliced pao and drizzled with a thrilling chutney of fresh herbs and curry leaves. Potato fritters are sandwiched between halves of pao in a fun evocation of wada pao, a Mumbai street snack.\n           \n\n            A curried shrimp turnover is a homage to one that Mr. Cardoz remembers eating as a child on the beaches in Goa. I\u2019d remember a hand pie this good, too. Another street snack he\u2019s toying around with is chaat; the night I had it, he was making it with sweet potatoes and apples, an untraditional assemblage that made perfect sense.\n           \n\n            One likably eccentric aspect of Mr. Cardoz\u2019s menu at North End Grill was the raft of egg dishes. Eggs make a more limited, but still memorable, appearance at Paowalla. Scrambled eggs patia are sultry with ginger and very, very soft; like the marrow, they come with sliced pao. Eggs kejriwal, meanwhile, is simple and totally likable: a sunny-side-up egg on toast ratcheted up by a green-chile chutney.\n           \n\n            With the larger plates, the playfulness and street-food allusions are mostly left behind. The results can be mixed.\n           \n\n            Mr. Cardoz has an excellent idea for getting New Yorkers to eat dal: He drops a globe of burrata in the middle of the plate. It\u2019s one of the only large plates without meat or fish; in general, it\u2019s a little tricker to eat a vegetarian meal at Paowalla than it should be.\n           \n\n            I wanted more flavor from the pork in baby pig vindaloo and a higher sour-to-sweet ratio from the sauce. And I wanted the bacon-and-chorizo biryani to be different in any number of ways: less saturated with smoke, more aromatic with spices, and probably cheaper than the $57 Paowalla is charging for it, although I might not whine about the price of this family-size portion if I had liked the way it tasted.\n           \n\n            The seafood main courses, though, tended to be very good, including the dogfish rubbed with a mildly spicy coating of coconut and tomatoes and then steamed inside a banana-leaf packet, or the whole sea bream roasted with a thick vein of vinegared spice paste inside.\n           \n\n            The menu sprawls, offering more than enough reasons to try Paowalla once. Whether you will come back depends on how much you mind the peculiarly disjointed dining space and service that can be unintentionally maddening.\n           \n\n            At first glance, Paowalla looks like a cozy neighborhood retreat, but several design decisions make it peculiarly uncomfortable. A row of stools facing a window puts anyone who sits there up for the inspection of pedestrians on Sullivan Street. The back end of the dining room is separated by a steel-and-glass partition, turning one medium-size space into two cramped, awkward ones and doing a real number on the acoustics. The most comfortable and, oddly enough, most peaceful evening I had at Paowalla was spent at a sidewalk table.\n           \n\n            That night was also free of a hovering, mosquitolike service style that I encountered inside. Once I had been spotted, somebody was always leaning in to clear a glass, or fill one, or wipe the table, or make room for another plate. When a new course arrived, before anybody had a chance to try any of it, I heard a question that was new to me.\n           \n\n            \u201cFirst impressions?\u201d\n           \n\n            It\u2019s bad enough to be asked, as happens more and more often lately, \u201cHow are the first few bites tasting?\u201d If we have to give opinions on how the food looks without tasting it, we may as well stay home looking at Instagram.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 45, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/09/dining/paowalla-review.html", "google_mag": 23.299999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n            It\u2019s complicated to praise someone whose confidence already seems to be reinforced with steel and clad in granite.

This has been a theme since his time in Atlanta, first at the Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton, Buckhead, and then at his own restaurant, called Seeger\u2019s.\n           \n\n            Christiane Lauterbach, an admirer from the moment she tasted his red cabbage (\u201cAha!\u201d she remembers thinking. \u201cA German who doesn\u2019t cook like a German!\u201d),\n            \n             wrote in Atlanta magazine\n            \n            in 1999 that his refusal to hire a parking valet at Seeger\u2019s cost him money. Each time it poured, customers canceled their reservations so they wouldn\u2019t have to get wet running from the lot to the front door.\n           \n\n            \u201cJa,\u201d Mr. Seeger told her. \u201cI do it my way.\u201d\n           \n\n            Those who wanted to eat at\n            \n             G\u00fcnter Seeger NY\n            \n            when it opened on Hudson Street in May had to do it his way, too. Instead of offering reservations, the restaurant sold tickets for $185 a person, service included.\n           \n\n            Paying for a meal in full up front always gives me the feeling that the restaurant is worried I\u2019m going to try to dine and dash. I put up with it, grumblingly, only for restaurants that have limited seatings and offer something I can\u2019t get anywhere else. What did G\u00fcnter Seeger NY have, besides Mr. Seeger himself, who hasn\u2019t had a restaurant since Seeger\u2019s closed nine years ago?\n           \n\n            New Yorkers griped. Then, in a sign that he has learned to bend a little, Mr. Seeger dropped the ticket scheme. Now he offers reservations, with a $100-a-person fee for cancellations within 48 hours. The restaurant\u2019s website also shows the day\u2019s menu, now priced at $148 before tip and tax. It\u2019s easier paying for dinner once you\u2019ve put away 10 to 12 courses and a bottle of German riesling from G\u00fcnter Seeger NY\u2019s impressive stash. But it isn\u2019t quite easy enough to keep you from wondering just what you\u2019re getting for the money.\n           \n\n            One thing it doesn\u2019t buy you is a lot of fabrics in the dining room. Velvety clusters of roses sit on the bare tables; the uncarpeted floors clatter with the footsteps of servers pacing back and forth; the brick walls are painted white and echo with stiff formalities.\n           \n\n            \u201cChef wants you to feel like he\u2019s welcoming you into his home,\u201d we were told one night. When you go to dinner there, do you have to call him Chef, too?\n           \n\n            This deeply undomestic dining room is overshadowed by the immense stainless-steel kitchen in the back, where Mr. Seeger and his crew are on display, moving soundlessly under lights of operating-room intensity.\n           \n\n            With every detail, G\u00fcnter Seeger NY tells you that the food is the whole show. At these prices, it had better be close to perfect.\n           \n\n            And on my first two meals, it was. The cooking is deeply expressive \u2014 expressive of the season and of Mr. Seeger\u2019s focused, disciplined style. He doesn\u2019t try for bizarre juxtapositions. When you\u2019re surprised by his cooking, it\u2019s because the voice of the ingredients is coming through more clearly than you\u2019re used to.\n           \n\n            Chilled pea soup had a beguiling, toasted depth, and even the garnish was delicious, an open pea pod stretched across the rim of a shot glass. On another night, the soup was lemon cucumber, and it was refreshing in the way you want a gin and tonic to be, or an afternoon shower.\n           \n\n            A squash blossom twisted around delicate lobster mousse was served with a distinctive squash blossom pesto, crunchy with pistachios and seasoned, thrillingly, with saffron.\n           \n\n            Mr. Seeger welcomed the return of matjes herring with an early-summer tartare that was bright with apples, cucumbers and the piercing taste of ginger. Abalone was quickly grilled, sliced and sent back to its shell with dashi, briny threads of sea bean and a live-wire dab of yuzukosho.\n           \n\n            There were moments of theatricality. One night, a server ferried a wheel of Parmigiano-Reggiano the size of a wedding cake to the table. \u201cThis is your cheese course,\u201d he said, then toted it away, returning a short time later with a plate dusted with grated cheese and grated pistachios and slivers of candied citron. It was very good.\n           \n\n            Mr. Seeger\u2019s people like to say that he draws up the menus while wandering the farmers\u2019 market each day. Like the bit about welcoming you into his home, this is largely fiction. He didn\u2019t find abalone or Parmigiano-Reggiano in a New York City Greenmarket.\n           \n\n            Well, who cares whether he gets his inspiration in Union Square or while talking on the phone to his importer: The point is that he knows where to find ingredients that speak far more eloquently than any server reeling off prepared talking points.\n           \n\n            After two dinners, I was as convinced of the excellence of Mr. Seeger\u2019s cooking as he seems to be. I knew the sterility of the dining room would keep some people away, and I wasn\u2019t sure anybody should have to pay quite so much for dinner, but the cooking had a finesse that\u2019s exciting to find because it\u2019s so rare.\n           \n\n            Then, in my last meal, nothing was quite as exquisite. Mr. Seeger\u2019s opening move that night was a ball of sweet, flat-tasting langoustine ice cream with caviar and a fragment of sea urchin. I love langoustines, and hated to see them end up like this. It was the first dish I\u2019d had that might have come from Mr. Seeger\u2019s recipe files from the \u201990s rather than straight from his heart.\n           \n\n            Later in the meal, that great squash-blossom pesto came back, this time with a small European sole the size of my hand. It had spent both too much time on the grill and too little. Crosshatches of char overpowered the sole\u2019s exquisite flavor, and yet the thickest part of the fish clung to the spine, not fully cooked.\n           \n\n            For all his confidence, Mr. Seeger must be feeling a bit exposed right now. His future in New York City is riding on a restaurant that\u2019s both brilliant and off-putting. Before it opened, Mr. Seeger\n            \n             told an interviewer\n            \n            , \u201cThe food will be simplistic, but also technically perfect.\u201d\n           \n\n            That\u2019s a cool trick when it works. When it doesn\u2019t, there\u2019s nowhere to hide.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 46, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/dining/gunter-seeger-ny-review.html", "google_mag": 26.600000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n            The bend halfway down Doyers Street in Chinatown used to see more killings than any other stretch of road in the country. The Bloody Angle is safe now, but not quiet.\n           \n\n            The gangs there have been replaced by packs of roaming young people who come for siu mai and har gow at\n            \n             Nom Wah Tea Parlor\n            \n            , or underground mezcal at\n            \n             Pulqueria\n            \n            , or archival cocktails at\n            \n             Apotheke\n            \n            . And, for the last few months, they\u2019ve been filing through the door under the long vertical neon sign that reads TUXEDO.\n           \n\n            Once inside this restaurant, whose full name is\n            \n             Chinese Tuxedo\n            \n            , you run into gridlock at the dark and crowded bar. A couple of besieged hosts try, without noticeable success, to control the flow of customers and winter coats moving in both directions along a narrow passageway. It\u2019s chaotic and claustrophobic, and you may feel a strong urge to go back outside.\n           \n\n            Keep going. At the end of the bar, the vista suddenly opens out, as if you had come out of a tunnel into daylight. You are standing at the top of a staircase that descends into a sunken dining room filled with round tables of bright white marble. Fluted columns of cast iron rise 15 feet to the ceiling. The walls look like an archaeological dig in progress, stripped back to old layers of paint and plaster. Curved black banquettes hug the perimeter, with tropical plants sprouting up behind them.\n           \n\n            The room has a vintage air and a gleam of drama, which is appropriate enough because it was once a Chinese theater, the first on the East Coast. During the Tong Wars of the early 20th century, the theater was neutral territory, where Hip Sings and Un Leongs sat separately but peaceably, until the day in 1905 when Hip Sing gunmen set off firecrackers during a performance and then opened fire on their rivals.\n           \n\n            The\n            \n             Chinese Theater Massacre\n            \n            isn\u2019t necessarily the piece of local history that Chinese Tuxedo wants to evoke. It takes its name from another turn-of-the-century establishment on Doyers Street, an ornate restaurant where a traditional carved second-story balcony crested with a larger-than-life-size eagle was built as a kind of advertisement for passengers on the Third Avenue elevated line, who could see it through the train windows.\n           \n\n            Like the original Chinese Tuxedo, this new model, which opened in November, makes its pitch to people passing through the neighborhood as well as to locals. On some nights, the crowd is a mix of white people here simply because it\u2019s new, and Chinese families tentatively poking at the fried eggplant and pork dumplings topped with flying fish roe. They look as if they are trying to decide whether this is really Chinese food.\n           \n\n            The answer is an unequivocal \u201csort of.\u201d The chef, Paul Donnelly, is a Scot. Until recently, he ran the kitchen at Ms. G\u2019s in Sydney, Australia, which specializes in entertainingly mongrelized dishes like cheeseburger spring rolls and masala fried rice.\n           \n\n            Mr. Donnelly has called his menu at Chinese Tuxedo \u201cfusion.\u201d That dreaded word deserves two qualifications. First, he doesn\u2019t tend to handcuff together unrelated cuisines that have nothing in common except a continent; most of his dishes have discernibly Chinese antecedents. Second, there is dumb fusion and there is smart fusion, and Mr. Donnelly practices the smart kind.\n           \n\n            Each time I went back, I wanted the fried eggplant in sticky, spicy caramel again. The flicker of Sichuan peppercorn in the sauce could be more pronounced, but the chile burn is just strong enough and the eggplant keeps its wonderful airy crunch even after sitting around for a while. So does the fried pork cheek in the reformed sweet-and-sour pork, stacked up above fresh pineapple chunks and a bracing vinegar sauce that is closer to the Cantonese version than to the orange ketchup sauce that glows radioactively from inside American takeout boxes.\n           \n\n            The long, sliced slab of char siu pork glazed with honey is simple and classic; if the excellent whole squab with a glossy Peking-duck-style lacquer on its skin turned up at Royal Seafood or another traditional Chinatown restaurant, nobody would blink. It\u2019s served in five pieces, one of which is the head. One of my guests crunched away happily on it, but I was more interested in the meatier quarters.\n           \n\n            These straight-faced Cantonese studies worked out better than Mr. Donnelly\u2019s halting excursions into Sichuan. The smashed cucumber salad was barely dented and scarcely seasoned. Mapo lo mein, a promising enough idea, was short on heat and swagger and long on sweetness. (This was one of the few dishes that struck me as too sweet, but the menu as a whole relies on sugar more than it should.)\n           \n\n            Mr. Donnelly puts more strut into his step when he freestyles. Steak tartare on rice crackers is seasoned with fried shallots and a healthy glug of fish sauce; it may be more Vietnamese than Chinese, but it\u2019s great. So is the glistening scoop of chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 that you spread, with a pickled slaw of apples and radishes, on youtiao, those cruller-like sticks of fried dough. And I think my favorite invention of his is the beef and broccoli made with tender, peppery tongue pastrami.\n           \n\n            While the kitchen is fairly consistent already, service is unpredictable. Sometimes dishes crowd the table, and other times they arrive one at a time. Once, we had two waiters shadowing us all night; another time, we sat with our menus for 20 minutes trying to catch somebody\u2019s eye. We thought somebody might take our order after an overexcited guest of mine accidentally knocked her wine glass onto the floor, but once the broken pieces were swept up, we must have put on our invisibility cloaks again.\n           \n\n            One major inconvenience: The restaurant is so popular that reservations are essential, but Chinese Tuxedo won\u2019t take them for parties of fewer than four. When three of us showed up at 6:30 p.m., we were told we might have to wait an hour and a half. As it turned out, it didn\u2019t take that long, but if I hadn\u2019t been on the job, I wouldn\u2019t have stuck around long enough to find out.\n           \n\n            The staff could also use more wine training. Chinese Tuxedo\u2019s list is not the kind that you can point at with your eyes closed and know you\u2019ll get a good bottle, but my servers weren\u2019t much help in sorting it out. I sat there wishing I could get wine delivered from\n            \n             Fung Tu\n            \n            or\n            \n             Mission Chinese Food\n            \n            , where the lists are deeper and more adroitly chosen for Chinese cooking. For the moment, Chinese Tuxedo has no hard liquor.\n           \n\n            But it does have one dessert that is almost worth a trip all by itself. Called Chinese strawberries and cream, it\u2019s a pretty pile of whipped cream and yogurt with fresh and dried strawberries, nuggets of mochi and a few other surprises. This is a dessert that has fun but also knows exactly what it\u2019s doing.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 47, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/dining/chinese-tuxedo-restaurant-review.html", "google_mag": 23.5}, {"review_text": "\n            Why do I keep going back to\n            \n             the Odeon\n            \n            ?\n           \n\n            It\u2019s not because\n            \n             people on Cond\u00e9 Nast expense accounts have returned\n            \n            to this TriBeCa landmark with the bones of a brasserie, even though it\u2019s nice to know that some editors still have time for lunch.\n           \n\n            Nor is it because Lena Dunham had the neon sign on West Broadway\n            \n             replicated in blazing-orange ink\n            \n            on her body this year, either, although I appreciate how neatly the sign\u2019s progress from the front cover of\n            \n             \u201cBright Lights, Big City\u201d\n            \n            in 1984 to Ms. Dunham\u2019s backside encapsulates the recent cultural history of New York.\n           \n\n            Nostalgia is not the lure for me. The Odeon was opened in 1980 by Lynn Wagenknecht; Keith McNally, whom she would later marry; and his brother, Brian. I had not moved to New York yet when the surfaces of its downstairs bathrooms provided cocaine runways for some \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d cast members and a troop of\n            \n             art-market players and fixers\n            \n            . And besides, knowing that by the end of the decade drug abuse would kill at least two famous regulars, John Belushi and Jean-Michel Basquiat, makes it hard to see much glamour in that white-powdered scene.\n           \n\n            I don\u2019t go to the Odeon for the last word in culinary fashions, which were part of the package under the first chef,\n            \n             Patrick Clark\n            \n            . Mr. Clark had cooked under Michel Gu\u00e9rard, one of the founders of nouvelle cuisine, and he was one of the earliest American chefs to apply its principles to homegrown ingredients.\n           \n\n            Moira Hodgson, who during her brief stint as restaurant critic for The Times in 1980 may have been one of the only people who went to the Odeon to eat, was impressed enough by dishes like \u201cm\u00e9daillons of tender veal on a green pool of pur\u00e9ed watercress artfully decorated by leeks, string beans, carrots and celery\u201d that she\n            \n             gave the restaurant two stars\n            \n            . (It got the same rating in its\n            \n             last full review\n            \n            , by Bryan Miller in 1989.)\n           \n\n            The kitchen at the Odeon, in the hands of Vincent Nargi for more than a decade, retrenched long ago to a comfortably broken-in lineup of French and American standards. So when I go, I often start with oysters on ice or with fris\u00e9e and lardons in warmed vinaigrette, even if I wonder why the poached egg that completes the salad is optional. In cold weather, I ask for a scalding crock of French onion soup, lifting my spoon higher and higher in the steam until the thread of melted Gruy\u00e8re finally snaps.\n           \n\n            Anything out of the ordinary I approach with caution. \u201cSpicy chicken dumplings\u201d turn out to be Buffalo chicken wontons with a blue cheese dipping sauce. This is every bit as wrong as it sounds. I ate one with the grim consolation of knowing I\u2019d gotten exactly what I deserved.\n           \n\n            The pressed octopus appetizer sounds risky, too, but it is good, tender and lightly charred with some chickpeas and preserved lemon and a smooth sauce of leeks.\n           \n\n            It\u2019s hard to look at the Odeon\u2019s slowly revolving ceiling fans, hanging globe lamps, white tablecloths and burgundy banquettes without the words \u201csteak frites\u201d popping into your head. This is an understandable reaction, and a smart one. The steak, a New York strip, is of high quality, and the fries are exactly what you\u2019re picturing, skinny and golden and salty in their paper-lined metal cups.\n           \n\n            If the words you hear instead are \u201cmoules frites,\u201d you\u2019re still in good shape; the mussels will be fat and fresh, and their saffron-cream sauce will be rich and flavorful, even if the taste of saffron is more of an allusion than an outright statement.\n           \n\n            Under Ms. Wagenknecht, now the sole owner, the restaurant looks virtually the same as it did when she and the McNallys assembled it, including the Art Deco bar, itself larger than many restaurants. One night, when I\u2019d arrived early, I was waiting there with a fine approximation of a Sazerac when I asked the bartender if there were any main courses I shouldn\u2019t overlook. He thought about it for a while.\n           \n\n            \u201cThe roast chicken is kind of a sleeper,\u201d he finally said. Whether roast chicken qualifies as an underdog is debatable, but the Odeon does a fine job with it and sends it to the table with root vegetables and a simple jus.\n           \n\n            A better sleeper candidate is the omelet. Who goes to a restaurant for an omelet? I do, if it\u2019s the one at the Odeon, which tastes like real eggs and is a little puffy but never looks as if it is trying out for a role as a balloon in Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade.\n           \n\n            Cooking like this is sometimes called comfort food, but I think of the menu and everything else about the Odeon as restorative. The word shares a root with restaurant, a term that goes back to\n            \n             pre-revolutionary France\n            \n            , when aristocrats made a show of their delicate constitutions by sipping health-giving bouillons in public dining rooms.\n           \n\n            The Odeon doesn\u2019t market itself to neurasthenics on the verge of collapse, but it does go out of its way not to jangle anybody\u2019s nerves. In so many places now, the servers want to know if you have any questions about the menu. (When you don\u2019t, they always seem disappointed.) They want to know if it\u2019s your first time, too, as if special instructions might be required.\n           \n\n            At the Odeon the servers never ask either question, probably because they assume the answer will be no. They are steady, unexcitable and prompt. Most of all, they don\u2019t seem to need anything from you except your order and eventually your credit card.\n           \n\n            Once in a while, it\u2019s nice not to be needed. It\u2019s good to know that you don\u2019t have to live up to the chef\u2019s expectations, too.\n           \n\n            The restaurant world has gone a little crazy lately. Other parts of the world were crazy a long time ago. This is why the Odeon has been hitting the spot for me these past few months. I go there to feel restored, to act sane for a while, and to finish my meal with a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e that\u2019s exactly what I expect.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 48, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/dining/the-odeon-review.html", "google_mag": 21.899999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n            From the first soft bite of blood sausage, I knew I would like\n            \n             Insa.\n            \n\n\n            Just seeing the word \u201csoondae\u201d on the menu of this new Korean restaurant had been enough to get my hopes up. Purplish links of coagulated pigs\u2019 blood bound by rice and an arterial network of springy, skinny cellophane noodles, soondae does not tend to travel far from Korean neighborhoods. Insa sits between a moving company and a mechanic\u2019s garage in an industrial patch of Brooklyn near the Gowanus Canal. The area is not crowded with Korean restaurants or, for that matter, Koreans.\n           \n\n            Soondae here? If nothing else, it suggested that Insa had plenty of confidence.\n           \n\n            I dragged one dark, purplish slice across a line of salt laced with ground chile and perilla seeds. The seared skin crackled between my teeth: the sign of an animal-gut casing. Blood sausage can sometimes be dry, but Insa\u2019s soondae spilled with tender crumbs that were almost juicy, moistened with braised pigs\u2019 snouts and ground belly meat. The noodles gave it a little bounce but didn\u2019t get in the way of the deep, galvanic taste of iron. It was wonderfully well made, and not quite like any soondae I\u2019d tasted on 32nd Street or on\n            \n             the kimchi belt along Northern Boulevard in Queens\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            Insa was opened before Christmas by\n            \n             Sohui Kim\n            \n            and her husband, Ben Schneider. He is the designer, woodworker, decorator of the themed karaoke rooms in back, and propmaster of the retro lounge that\u2019s dressed in David Lynch red. She is the chef.\n           \n\n            Mr. Schneider was raised in Manhattan. Ms. Kim moved from Seoul to the Bronx when she was 10. The couple also owns\n            \n             the Good Fork\n            \n            , about two miles away in Red Hook, Brooklyn, where the menu dips its toes into Korean cuisine. The one at Insa dives straight into it.\n           \n\n            Chefs trying to get American eaters to fall for another country\u2019s cooking often toss essential flavors out the window. The restaurant crosses over, but the cuisine becomes roadkill. Insa is a rare crossover that limits most of its tweaks to externals. Traditional Korean recipes may be altered, in texture for instance (soondae is not usually pan-seared), but their spirit is largely left intact.\n           \n\n            For customers who did not grow up with Korean food, Insa puts extra clarity into the way the menu is written and explained by servers, most of whom are lavishly tattooed. Almost nothing on it qualifies as fusion, though. Even the seafood corn dog has antecedents in Seoul, although Insa hasn\u2019t yet copied the impressive Korean idea of\n            \n             incorporating French fries right into a corn dog\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            Officially, Insa is a barbecue restaurant. Gas burners are punched into the centers of the long mess-hall tables lined up between buffed wooden benches. The tables are about as wide across as a rowboat. This made conversation a challenge \u2014 one of my guests, who has a voice that could wake sleeping livestock, later said he wanted to borrow a karaoke microphone to make himself heard \u2014 but we needed the space when the rest of the food came.\n           \n\n            As soon as the blue flames jump up, little dishes (banchan) start to circle the ring. Good banchan signal seriousness in a Korean kitchen, and the ones at Insa are really flavorful, made with care: cabbage and daikon, pink with chile paste and fermented on site; chewy black beans in salty syrup; peanuts with silvery dried anchovies; chewy bands of cuttlefish with time-release flavor.\n           \n\n            Barbecue was rarely my favorite thing on the table, though. The very fresh-tasting squid and octopus grilled up beautifully, but I missed the scent of charcoal, and Insa\u2019s gas flames seemed too low to give the marinated short rib strips or thinly shaved brisket the crisp edges I like. The dishes I look forward to eating again are those cooked in the open kitchen off to one side.\n           \n\n            Insa\u2019s yuk hwe is one of the most suave versions of beef tartare any Korean restaurant has served me. The chopped eye of round is chilly and firm, crunchy with Asian pear and fried capers, and deliciously shiny with sesame oil. I would have lapped it up with a spoon, but it was, no doubt, better on gnarled curls of shrimp chips. Insa\u2019s tteokbokki are terrific, too: pudgy little fingers of rice stick blackly seared on the bottom for crunch. They are tossed with tender ovals of seafood sausage and smacked with chile paste.\n           \n\n            The heat was not incinerating, but it was warm enough. At other times, Insa didn\u2019t supply the burn I\u2019ve come to love at other Korean restaurants. The bibimbap in particular seemed afraid of getting noticed.\n           \n\n            Spice doses can be recalibrated, though. What sets Insa apart is a modern chef\u2019s sensitivity to technique and ingredients. (The squid that are so good on the grill are just as welcome in the thick and unusually fluffy seafood pajeon.) The chef de cuisine, Michael Stokes, came up with the soondae, and the sous-chef, Yong Shin, is responsible for the seafood corn dog, a fine snack to eat at Insa\u2019s tiki bar.\n           \n\n            There, no outrigger dangles from the ceiling, and an animated underwater video screen stands in for the tanks of live fish at torchlit palaces like the dearly departed\n            \n             Kahiki Supper Club\n            \n            in Columbus, Ohio. But the bartenders wear aloha shirts as they reach for coconut mugs and Fu Manchu cups for their modernized Polynesian drinks.\n           \n\n            A tiki bar! Exotica from Polynesia, a land so vaguely defined in the American imagination that it was able to encompass pi\u00f1a coladas, egg rolls and teriyaki chicken, clearly has no business in a serious modern Korean restaurant. But bastardized cocktails are preferable to bastardized cuisine.\n           \n\n            The cocktail menu looks interesting. To tell the truth, I never made it past the mai tai. The first one I tried was dominated by \u201clocal almond milk syrup\u201d (orgeat cooked up in Red Hook from nonlocal nuts), but in my second, the lime juice was prominent, the way it should be. It wasn\u2019t\n            \n             a Trader Vic\u2019s mai tai,\n            \n            but it was all right in its own way, I decided, as I finished my fourth.\n           \n\n            By that time, I was in the jungle room, clutching a microphone for dear life as if that would be enough to give me the extra octaves I needed for\n            \n             \u201cBlue Bayou.\u201d\n            \n            I hadn\u2019t meant to sing. But one of the servers had opened the door on a room swaddled in orchids and tropical leaves and artificial turf. Then somebody keyed\n            \n             a Dolly Parton number\n            \n            into the karaoke machine. \u201cThere\u2019s also a deep-sea room, a space room and a psychedelic room,\u201d the server said, discreetly closing the door.\n           \n\n            I\u2019d like to describe all the others. To tell the truth, I never made it past the jungle room.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 50, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/dining/insa-restaurant-review.html", "google_mag": 26.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n            What a gnarled knot of warring impulses I feel about\n            \n             Lowlife\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            One minute, I want to stand on Stanton Street holding the door open while I give tips to diners on their way in: order the guinea-hen sausage, don\u2019t miss the lamb tartare, above all eat the yakitori chicken. The next, I want to form a one-man human chain across the entrance and warn hungry people to go somewhere else.\n           \n\n            When I think about the best parts of this restaurant opened in November by Alex Leonard, the very talented chef, and Hugh Crickmore, the owner, I want to shake their hands. When I remember how much money I\u2019ve spent there and how bizarrely pretentious the service can be, not just for the Lower East Side but for any neighborhood, I want to shake them by the shoulders until they come to their senses.\n           \n\n            Like many relationships that end in conflict, mine with Lowlife started in a happy rush of discovery. There was the smell of raw pine walls as soon as I walked in: invigorating. The wood gives the dining room the look of a sauna where people don\u2019t sweat and keep their clothes on.\n           \n\n            I loved the sense of open space, too. Mr. Crickmore fought the urge to cover every inch of floor with seats. I could have stretched out my arms as I walked past a table of big men in black cowboy hats (how did they get here?) and along a long brown row of soft leather banquettes, beyond a bar and a framed cluster of birch trunks, to my seat at a kitchen counter. Just beyond was another cluster of tables, also spacious, also flanked by leather benches. The design is semi-Scandinavian, in the way of so many New York dining rooms lately, but it is not all frigid slanting-winter-light pallor. There\u2019s some warmth.\n           \n\n            Then I sat facing the grill, and the scent of beef fat falling with a hiss on hardwood coals made some buried animal nerve in my skull hum to life. Mr. Leonard used to be the chef de cuisine at\n            \n             Blanca\n            \n            , the high-end tasting counter in Brooklyn where dry-aged meat is also cooked over white-oak charcoal from Japan. His menu bears other minimalist Blanca imprints. There are few empty gestures in his cooking; almost everything on the plate is there for a reason.\n           \n\n            First, I tried salty hackleback caviar and raw ribbons of fluke, flavored by the day or so it had cured between sheets of kelp; sitting in a coriander-seasoned broth, they made a delicious pair. I ate slowly, to stretch the time.\n           \n\n            I had ordered guinea hen, too, and was surprised to get a smooth, pale sausage wrapped in the hen\u2019s browned skin to make a kind of weisswurst. Next to it were two sauces, one tan and yeasty, made with sourdough; the other dark and smoky, made from eggplant. This was some wonderful, subtle cooking.\n           \n\n            A rib-eye cap, fresh from the charcoal and running with juices, had so much flavor it didn\u2019t really need the anchovy-and-garlic emulsion or the nettle sauce served alongside it. As I chewed, I watched a succession of even bigger hunks of rib-eye, bone and all, leave the grill for the front of the restaurant. Finally it dawned on me: The men in black hats must have heard that Lowlife serves excellent steak.\n           \n\n            What it does best of all is yakitori chicken. Cut up and blackened over charcoal, the bird has deep natural flavor and is brushed with a citrus-tinged glaze that is, by several miles, the best teriyaki sauce I have ever tasted. The squirt of green scallion sauce on the plate has nothing to do there and seems to know it. The crisp and smoky leaves of lightly charred cabbage are vital, though.\n           \n\n            As I said, it all started well. But on return visits, I noticed a leaden self-importance that began to feel stifling.\n           \n\n            I have never seen a restaurant clear dirty dishes the way Lowlife does. Two servers would flank the table. Each would reach in and remove a single knife at the same moment. Then one spoon each, again in synchrony. Then two forks would rise and disappear. Finally, two plates, now free of silverware, would be taken away, solemnly and ceremoniously, as if they had died fighting for their country. A bugler should have stood by, softly playing taps.\n           \n\n            Servers often talked with an affected tone that undermined the friendliness their smiles projected. One spoke about the coming meal as \u201cthe experience.\u201d Dishes were \u201cintroduced,\u201d as in, \u201cNow I\u2019d like to introduce you to your third course of the evening, our chicken.\u201d Pleased to meet you, chicken. What do you say we make a run for the door?\n           \n\n            Fussiness this extreme would be out of place at\n            \n             Le Bernardin\n            \n            . At a Lower East Side restaurant where you listen to Kendrick Lamar, Stereolab and Ryan Adams while eating teriyaki chicken, it\u2019s lunacy.\n           \n\n            The cost of a meal, while not quite insane, does suggest that Lowlife\u2019s personality is not fully integrated. Servers will suggest three courses \u201cif you are dinner-hungry,\u201d as one put it. If I had ordered poached lobster and guinea-hen sausage, the two most expensive appetizers, and followed them with the rib-eye cap, I would have spent $94 before tax, tip and drinks. This doesn\u2019t include dessert, either, although if I had attempted dessert after that meal, they would still be peeling my exploded carcass from the pine walls.\n           \n\n            Not that you would recognize the appetizers from looking at the menu, an uncategorized list. Servers have to explain that it is in ascending order of size. The smallest appetizer, a very good assemblage of trout roe, thick clotted cream and pur\u00e9ed beets, isn\u2019t filling at all; the largest, the guinea hen, could make a light main course.\n           \n\n            Individually, the prices aren\u2019t out of line compared with, say,\n            \n             Le Turtle\n            \n            , a nearby restaurant whose chef also cooked at Blanca. But add them up and they can cause squirming, especially on a night when the $120 bone-in rib-eye is lukewarm, or when the lag between courses is so long you could have eaten a whole meal somewhere down the street.\n           \n\n            If I did duck out, I would still try to make it back in time to finish with the almost-classical French apple tart painted with orange marmalade, or the unusual and appealing eucalyptus panna cotta, whipped into a froth.\n           \n\n            Warring impulses again, but then Lowlife suffers from them, too. The place wants to be cool; you can tell from the walls of one bathroom, where Allen Ginsberg\u2019s inscribed\n            \n             photograph\n            \n            of Neal Cassady and Timothy Leary hangs across from a signed Joseph Beuys poster. But it\u2019s hard to be cool when you\u2019re trying to act important.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 51, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/23/dining/lowlife-restaurant-review.html", "google_mag": 25.899999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n            Roughly half of what I\u2019ve eaten at\n            \n             Sauvage\n            \n            since it opened just before Memorial Day has been either forgettable or familiar. In the other half, though, this restaurant in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, seemed to be on to something exciting, a combination of European kitchen discipline and a gut instinct for meeting appetite head on.\n           \n\n            Nothing I ate this summer knocked me back quite as hard as Sauvage\u2019s pig head confit. The name is no figure of speech. This is the head of a pig in profile, flattened like a Cuban sandwich. I was still staring at it when a server said sweetly: \u201cJust so you know: I forgot to mention that the sauce is made from the brains. It\u2019s coming out of the ear.\u201d\n           \n\n            When brain sauce is spilling from the ear of a pig, you don\u2019t need to tell me what to do. I tore into the head, beginning with the tanned cheeks, following the curve of the smile and ending with the round snout, the size of a Ritz cracker. The skin was chewy and crunchy, with a compressed layer of firm meat underneath, basted in fat.\n           \n\n            On the side were plump white shell beans baked with some pig tongue, along with bitter greens in vinaigrette. The beans would have been creamier with a few more minutes in the oven, but on the whole, I couldn\u2019t get over how skillfully done it all was.\n           \n\n            The chef is Lisa Giffen. She cooked for about three years at Adour Alain Ducasse, with shorter stays at\n            \n             Daniel\n            \n            and\n            \n             Blue Hill\n            \n            . In 2013, she was hired to run the kitchen of\n            \n             Maison Premiere\n            \n            , a cocktail parlor and raw bar in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, whose owners opened Sauvage.\n           \n\n            I ate at Maison Premiere one night just after Ms. Giffen had started. I remember thinking that the compositions were pretty; the ingredients, especially the seafood, were excellent; and the portions were feathery, to the point that I wasn\u2019t convinced I\u2019d had dinner.\n           \n\n            There is some wispiness on the menu at Sauvage, too. Sea urchin with scraps of pickled watermelon rind didn\u2019t make a lasting impression. A terrine of leeks with clams needed salt and acidity. A salad of peeled and pickled grapes, a recent special, wasn\u2019t worth the obvious trouble that had gone into making it. The same was true of a plate of tiny stuffed vegetables, including a baby eggplant that was cute but underbaked.\n           \n\n            But Ms. Giffen\u2019s talents are best used when she abandons the miniaturist mode. There\u2019s a full-throttle thrill to breaking open chilled snow crab legs and dunking their briny flesh in brown butter that\u2019s reinforced with mashed crab liver. There\u2019s undeniable pleasure in slicing open the malakoff, dough mixed with alpine-style cheese that\u2019s lumped on a slice of sourdough and then deep fried. This bonanza of starch, cheese and oil comes with pickled vegetables. It should also come with a small mountain for you to you climb after you finish it.\n           \n\n            Ms. Giffen\u2019s chicken pot-au-feu is an essay in beak-to-tail poultry cooking. The breast goes into delicate white sausages that share an enameled casserole with a confit of dark meat, mushrooms, carrots and fennel. The vegetables are braised but still crisp. On a separate plate is a slice of sourdough toast spread with whipped schmaltz and fragments of brittle skin; the menu doesn\u2019t call them gribenes, but I will.\n           \n\n            The pot-au-feu is a small feast and, at $25, a great buy. The pig head confit is $65. While price is not likely to be a deciding factor for people who want brain sauce coming out of a pig\u2019s ear, there is a more affordable cut of pork on the menu. An Old Spot porterhouse, set off with pickled rhubarb, was intensely good and cost $31. The meat, robustly seasoned and juicy, was cooked and served on a bone that was last seen between the teeth of a woman at my table.\n           \n\n            Like\n            \n             Liz Johnson at Mimi\n            \n            in Greenwich Village, Ms. Giffen doesn\u2019t cook in a systematically French way; both chefs just borrow French ideas at will and both have the French knack for spurring desire and then satisfying it. You can taste Ms. Giffen\u2019s respect for the Gallic kitchen in the way she makes potatoes: the creamy dauphinoise with strip steak, the lavishly buttered chunks and bits of potato with lobster (itself slicked down with olive oil and served with a subtle, earthy blood sauce).\n           \n\n            One area that would benefit from a more overtly French treatment is the dessert menu. Recently there was a honey panna cotta, a chocolate cremeux and a mascarpone semifreddo \u2014 three variations on a sweet, creamy substance with random stuff in it. Cheese, when it\u2019s offered, is a more persuasive last course.\n           \n\n            Ms. Giffen is a partner in the restaurant along with Joshua Boissy and Krystof Zizka, the people behind Maison Premiere.\n            \n             When Maison Premiere opened in 2011\n            \n            , its attention to period details like the weathered French Quarter facade, the antique absinthe fountain and the suspendered barmen was so thorough that it was easy to believe you\u2019d wandered into an underground party for enthusiasts of Belle \u00c9poque New Orleans cosplay.\n           \n\n            But there was a serious dedication to food and drink, both of which got better as the place went along. (The quality of the work at Maison Premiere\u2019s bar won it\n            \n             an award from the James Beard Foundation\n            \n            this year.)\n           \n\n            For all the hype about Brooklyn restaurants, the ones that turn out to be most impressive often come together slowly. Before\n            \n             Chef\u2019s Table at Brooklyn Fare\n            \n            and\n            \n             Roberta\u2019s\n            \n            became national names, it was hard to tell whether they were following a grand, premeditated design or just making it up as they went along.\n           \n\n            Sauvage at least has the advantage of starting off with expertise that Maison Premiere needed several years to accumulate. It has Ms. Giffen. It has Will Elliot, a former bartender at the first establishment whose cocktail recipes and spirit choices at Sauvage I\u2019ve enjoyed very much, even though I haven\u2019t had a chance to try out all six forms of ice he is rumored to stock. It has a wine list whose shallow end is very rewarding and whose deep end betrays extensive, possibly obsessive attention.\n           \n\n            This is no doubt the case with the restaurant\u2019s design, too, but this time the owners are not as interested in historical re-enactment. Sauvage, which sits across the street from McCarren Park and opens its cafe doors on warm days and nights, seems to come from another era, but it\u2019s hard to say which one the owners had in mind. Maybe they\u2019re making it up as they go along.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 53, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/dining/sauvage-restaurant-review.html", "google_mag": 28.899999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n         Apparently there are people who believe that the Internet has made restaurant critics irrelevant.

It is overseen by Mr. Vongerichten, who collaborates on the food with Dan Kluger, the executive chef here and next door at\n         \n          ABC Kitchen\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         \u201cInternational culture\u201d must refer to the menu, which rummages through the cupboards of Spanish-speaking countries in\n         \n\n\n          Europe\n         \n         (that would be\n         \n\n\n          Spain\n         \n         ), Mexico,\n         \n\n\n          Central America\n         \n         and\n         \n\n\n          South America\n         \n         (although you don\u2019t need to go to\n         \n\n\n          Argentina\n         \n         these days to find chimichurri).\n        \n\n         This attempt to reassemble the Spanish Empire does not shed new light on any of these cuisines. Intellectually and culturally, it borders on incoherence. But in the kitchen it has inspired a large number of smart, exciting dishes along with a small handful of slightly peculiar ones.\n        \n\n         You can get along just fine without intellectual coherence when the flavors are as clear and harmonious as they are in a ceviche of white shrimp bathed in a vivid citrus sauce. Just as the throb of habaneros begins to build up, a bite of soft banana or a crisp Marcona almond breaks the tension.\n        \n\n         And sure, maybe the first person to put cucumber, dill and yogurt together with cured salmon wasn\u2019t all that fluent in Spanish. Fine. ABC Cocina\u2019s version is still great, with dried chiles powdering the edges of the sweet and smoky fish, and an unexpectedly bright acidity in the cucumber, which is zippy where you expect it to be soothing.\n        \n\n         There\u2019s an alchemy at work at ABC Cocina, the kind that can turn the last thing you\u2019d want to order into the first thing you\u2019ll ask for next time around. For me, it was the vegetables with brown rice, which I expected would taste like a tea made by steeping the yellowed pages of the \u201cMoosewood Cookbook\u201d in warm kombucha and straining it through Pigpen\u2019s bandanna. It was, in fact, one of the freshest, cleanest vegetable dishes I\u2019ve tasted all summer. The rice was fluffy, not gluey, and each vegetable \u2014 baby fennel, tender carrots, skinny asparagus \u2014 spoke out clearly. The rice was dressed with a salsa verde that came across as more of an herb vinaigrette with a citrus rasp and a little spice. The vegetables were so tender and seasonal, you could call this a farm-to-table dish, but it\u2019s almost too light on its feet for that.\n        \n\n         The \u201cmichelin star chef\u201d (Mr. Vongerichten has done all right by this newspaper, too) and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 are both minimalists, but in different ways. Mr. Kluger has a gift for making his ingredients, especially the vegetables, taste a little purer than almost anyone else\u2019s. With the best of Mr. Vongerichten\u2019s dishes, on the other hand, it\u2019s not the main ingredient you remember as much what he has done to it: a three-ingredient sauce or marinade whose ingredients are suspended in a tense standoff.\n        \n\n         Once in a great while, the two approaches \u2014 one interventionist, the other more conservative \u2014 are at war. I loved the deep, meaty flavors of roasted maitake mushroom chunks pieced together around a core of warm goat cheese, but couldn\u2019t understand what either ingredient was supposed to get out of a sharply acidic Fresno pepper vinaigrette. And I\u2019d skip the sweet barbecue sauce with black sea bass; the interplay of thyme and tamarind in the marinade was enough to carry the fish.\n        \n\n         More often, the team of Vongerichten and Kluger puts you in the excellent dilemma of not knowing which you like better, the food or its sauce. Should more restaurants have fried squid this sweet and fresh, or should more of them look beyond lemon wedges and marinara to find something with the rounded sweet-and-sour depth of ABC Cocina\u2019s ancho glaze?\n        \n\n         I hope this kind of dish is what \u201cfusion of tradition and innovation uniting yesterday and tomorrow\u201d means, and not the drippy, messy burger going around in taco drag. The warm, slightly shiny tortillas have a depth of masa flavor that is shown off better by roasted mushrooms with a peanut-based\n         \n\n\n          mole\n         \n         . Or by the one big piece of tempura-fried fish with spicy mayonnaise and citrus-dressed cabbage. Or by the BLT taco, which translates each element of a classic \u00a0Mexican pork-based taco into idiomatic American English, with roasted pork belly and a red-and-yellow jumble of tiny, juicy heirloom tomatoes.\n        \n\n         I know what you\u2019re thinking: enough with the eclectic, enchanting cuisine already \u2014 let\u2019s hear about the romantic, mystical atmosphere! I am sorry to disappoint you, but ABC Cocina didn\u2019t seem very romantic to me, or especially mystical, either. It looked to me like a fairly simple cafe, with metal chairs and bare tables, located inside a lighting showroom.\n        \n\n         That is essentially what it is. The restaurant, like ABC Kitchen, is inside ABC Carpet & Home, and nearly every object is for sale: lighting fixtures, chairs, plates, pyrite rocks, fragments of wasps\u2019 nests and water bottles that come with a stick of charcoal\u00a0(\u201cthe vision of abc home curation\u201d). A surprising number of those lighting fixtures have tiny bulbs embedded in long tentacles that dangle over the dining room like jellyfish. I could see how it might be romantic and mystical if you are sexually attracted to gelatinous sea creatures.\n        \n\n         As for \u201cdynamic love affair,\u201d you are going to have to ask\n         \n\n\n          Google\n         \n         . I have absolutely no idea.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 55, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-abc-cocina-in-manhattan.html", "google_mag": 24.5}, {"review_text": "\n            Before I\u2019d seen my first chile pepper at Guan Fu, it was already clear that it is a new kind of Sichuan restaurant for New York.\n           \n\n            To get there, you head to downtown Flushing, Queens, cross a courtyard off Prince Street and pass between the two stone lions under a small Chinese gabled roof, guarding the front door. Inside is a dignified dining room where polished wood panels stand next to weathered wooden screens under gilded, illuminated ceiling recesses.\n           \n\n            In the private rooms visible behind sliding doors, a few of the chairs look like small thrones. The ones in the main dining room are elaborate, cushioned and wide enough for two. The tables are set with dark wooden chopstick handles, wrapped in metal filigree at one end, with brushed steel tips at the other. To use them, you twist disposable bamboo tips into the steel ends. While you\u2019re doing this, a server brings a party-size segmented wooden bowl holding sunflower seeds and roasted watermelon seeds for you to crack open while you page through the menu.\n           \n\n            Guan Fu Sichuan\u2019s formality and rich interior detail are rare among this city\u2019s Sichuan restaurants. Atmosphere doesn\u2019t fill your stomach, of course, but when it\u2019s done right, it can slow you down and wake your senses to the smells and tastes on the way.\n           \n\n            That is the case at Guan Fu, where the kitchen doesn\u2019t always try to strafe your palate into submission with a hail of chiles. The flavors are potent, but they don\u2019t get all of their force from their heat.\n           \n\n            I didn\u2019t think I could love Sichuan boiled fish with pickled vegetables more than I already do until I tasted Guan Fu\u2019s version. Here the body and flavor of what is typically a rather thin sauce is broadened with a stock made from fish bones. Fresh green chiles provide a heat held in thrilling check by the sourness. The broth is too intensely salty to qualify as soup, the server explained, but I still drank as much of it as I could handle.\n           \n\n            The kitchen gives mapo tofu, that old war horse, a new lease on life. While the chile heat is not full-bore, the fermented beans and other components are. Shimmering over jiggly mounds of white tofu is a mapo sauce as deeply flavored as any I\u2019ve tasted.\n           \n\n            Cabbage is fried with pork and fresh chiles, but the appeal of the dish is the way the invisible presence of Sichuan peppercorns sets your mouth and lips tingling.\n           \n\n            And there is hardly any heat at all in the \u201ceggplant with iron plate.\u201d Traditionally made at home for Sichuan spring festivals, the dish was new to me, and I was very glad to make its acquaintance. Slices of eggplant are slit open, stuffed like dumplings with a pork-eggplant filling, then closed up, battered and fried. They are served in a pan kept over a small flame. The sauce that coated them was swimming with scallions and a few lengths of dried chile, but it drew its energy from the tension between sweet and sour.\n           \n\n            Not that the kitchen avoids spices. One reason to keep your wits about you while eating at Guan Fu is that you can\u2019t always tell when extreme heat is about to rain down like Judgment Day.\n           \n\n            One of the hottest things on the menu, the Guan Fu-style cuttlefish salad, contains almost no red chiles. Its ability to shock and amaze comes from fresh green chiles that are roasted until black, skinned and made into a sauce that tastes almost Mexican. Barely cooked cuttlefish are scored with a knife so they twist up and look like little pine cones. That potent green sauce insinuates itself into every one of their crevices.\n           \n\n            This is one of many Guan Fu dishes that are rarely seen in New York, if ever. The menu is about 40 glossy pages long and full of color photographs of coral groupers, crystal crabs and other sea animals. In some parts it looks like a children\u2019s book, although the kids won\u2019t like the way the story ends for the soft-shell turtle.\n           \n\n            If you order one, a live specimen is brought out for inspection and reappears a short time later in pieces, mingled with potatoes, green beans and pickled cherry peppers. Its shell lies over the dish like a green cloche. Tradition dictates that the oldest person at the table has first crack at the chewy rim of fat around the edge. (At my table, that honor went to me. It and the soft cartilage were the most interesting parts of the animal; the meat was like fish-flavored chicken.)\n           \n\n            Not all the exotic imported species were available when I went, and others were offered at prices that scared me off. They are, presumably, meant for other customers who can afford to pay for a taste of home. Guan Fu, which joins a cluster of restaurants under the Hyatt Place hotel in the One Fulton Square real estate venture, is a reflection of the new money that is starting to transform this end of Flushing. The owners, Li Boru and Xue Wei, moved from China to New York to go to graduate school and wanted to open a restaurant that would evoke the aristocratic cooking of China\u2019s dynastic era.\n           \n\n            For ordinary budgets, the kitchen will make most fish dishes with either tilapia or sea bass. The bass, clean and fresh tasting, is what I ordered with the pickled vegetables and in an equally heroic dish called \u201chomemade roasted fish.\u201d The bass was cooked whole and served with crunchy lotus root in a dark, fiery, wonderful stew seasoned with cilantro, Sichuan peppercorns and a 32-ingredient chile oil.\n           \n\n            Among the menu\u2019s soft spots were two dishes any Sichuan restaurant should nail. Both dan dan noodles and kung pao chicken were unaccountably sleepy. Still, the noodles themselves, made on site, were very good, and the chicken had real flavor, which isn\u2019t always the case. This wasn\u2019t enough to make either dish interesting, but it does show the care Guan Fu takes with its ingredients.\n           \n\n            The day-to-day cooking is in the hands of one chef and the recipes are the domain of another, who works in Chengdu, the capital of the Sichuan Province. Mr. Li and Mr. Xue declined to name either man, citing personal reasons and a fear of chef poachers.\n           \n\n            According to one server, the chef in Chengdu was meant to join the one in Flushing but has been prevented from leaving China. This may explain some minor kitchen inconsistencies, like knife work that can be painstaking on some nights but haphazard on others.\n           \n\n            The dining room staff is variable, too. Multiple cues were missed at one dinner, when plates weren\u2019t changed and cups of very good jasmine tea weren\u2019t refilled as often as we would have liked. During other meals, the servers were extraordinarily eager to help.\n           \n\n            Guan Fu is a restaurant with room to grow. But it is an exceptional one already, throwing open a window on Sichuan cuisine to show New Yorkers the nuance and rich variety that lie beyond the old blast of chiles.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 56, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/dining/guan-fu-sichuan-review.html", "google_mag": 26.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n            First, some disclosures are in order. Gabrielle Hamilton, who owns\n            \n             Prune\n            \n            , writes\n            \n             one column a month\n            \n            for The New York Times Magazine. I don\u2019t have anything to do with that, but I have\n            \n             edited a few\n            \n            of\n            \n             her essays\n            \n            in the past. We had a fine time working together, and kept in touch for a while. About a decade ago we introduced our toddlers for a play date while she cooked breakfast. It ended after her son hit mine over the head with a toy truck.\n           \n\n            I haven\u2019t seen her in the five and a half years I\u2019ve been reviewing restaurants, though, even when I\u2019ve eaten at Prune, in the East Village. And, against our personal history, one has to balance the simmering resentment I feel each time I remember that writing is only a sideline for Ms. Hamilton, and yet she\u2019s better at it than most people who do it for a living, including me.\n           \n\n            Any new Prune customer who isn\u2019t already aware that Ms. Hamilton is a very good writer will realize it when the menus arrive. They are put together by somebody who understands how words work. Although these days she drafts them with Ashley Merriman, whom she married last year and with whom she shares the title of chef, their tone has not changed in the 18 years Prune has been open.\n           \n\n            They do not follow the current fad of forcing nouns into shotgun weddings to which no prepositions, participles or conjunctions were invited (\u201ccod, radish, yogurt, nasturtium\u201d). Instead you see phrases that could be in the first sentence of a short story you wouldn\u2019t be able to put down.\n           \n\n            Under the bar snacks is one I defy you to read without feeling a spasm of curiosity: \u201cTurkish disco pistachios.\u201d You may not instantly grasp that the nuts are going to be roasted before your eyes over a mound of flaming salt, or that when the fire goes out they will be warm and will have the unmistakable flavor of anise, but you will know that\n            \n             something\n            \n            is about to happen.\n           \n\n            Often, the phrases are more direct. One of the vegetables recently was \u201cCorn on the cob with butter and salt.\u201d You might see corn on the cob anywhere, but the butter and salt are the kind of concrete details that could make this a line from a poem about summer. Here\u2019s another line: \u201cplain boiled zucchini drowned in olive oil.\u201d There were four delicious little squashes, cooked whole with their bright firm stems on, and there was indeed enough clean, grassy oil to drown them.\n           \n\n            What\u2019s that I hear? Is that an objection from someone who boils zucchini at home? Go ahead, knock yourself out. Just don\u2019t try to tell me that I\u2019ve been scammed. The whole objective of Prune is and always has been to cook the food of hunger and desire, strip it of the usual restaurant window dressing, and put it in front of you.\n           \n\n            This is why the menu reads so well. Good writing comes from clear thinking, and Ms. Hamilton\u2019s thoughts on what makes a satisfying dinner have always been extremely clear. What more could you ask from the start of a meal than saut\u00e9ed chanterelles shedding mushroom juice and butter into a thick slice of toasted white bread? And what could you add to improve a main course of swordfish, grilled gently enough that a ros\u00e9 blush is left in its flesh, with melted anchovy butter that runs into the tiny boiled potatoes?\n           \n\n            Well, there is a garnish: a lemon wedge and a parsley sprig. This I suppose counts as restaurant window dressing, but because it comes from another era it also evokes a specific sense memory that gives meaning to the whole dish.\n           \n\n            Over the years Ms. Hamilton has delegated the cooking to several people. I didn\u2019t eat there under every regime, but I can say that the meals I\u2019ve eaten since Ms. Merriman arrived from the Waverly Inn early last year have been at least as good as any I\u2019ve ever had at Prune. Certainly the cooking is more steadily skillful and more varied than it was around the time of\n            \n             its last Times review\n            \n            , a dozen years ago, when Frank Bruni gave it one star.\n           \n\n            Not everything sparkles; a ragout of artichokes and shell beans tasted about as gray as it looked. But for the most part Ms. Merriman has managed to nest her style inside her wife\u2019s while, I think, expanding the boundaries of both.\n           \n\n            Braised rabbit leg is a very Prune thing to cook, but I doubt that in 1999 it would have been presented, as it was earlier this summer, over yellow hexagons of carrot mixed with Calabrian chiles, mint leaves and pine nuts, with a handful of fried bread crumbs thrown over the top. That Mediterranean tilt could be Ms. Merriman\u2019s work, but the dish still has a Hamiltonian directness.\n           \n\n            The grilled branzino on the menu, on the other hand, is a classic Hamilton dish. The simplicity \u2014 a whole fish on a plate \u2014 has her name all over it, and the application of fennel oil is the sort of nuance \u2014 invisible, politely insistent \u2014 she prefers to screamingly interventionist moves.\n           \n\n            The two women run a kitchen that is capable of intricate footwork, but that\u2019s not what it\u2019s known for. What they and their cooks do, you can too, generally. This was true back when Prune still served canned sardines loaded onto a plate with Triscuits, pickles and a bloop of mustard, a dish that didn\u2019t take any cooking but did require enough nerve to fill a punch bowl.\n           \n\n            The sardines are not on the menu, but cans are kept on hand for sentimental customers. The nerve is still there, although a less fraught word for it is confidence. It is confidence that allows Prune to place a scrupulously made martini on the cocktail list next to a Long Island Iced Tea that has been purged of its scuzzier ingredients but is still pretty louche.\n           \n\n            It is confidence that gets you unshowy desserts like slices of black plums tossed with sugar, lemon zest and cardamom and spread out on buttered toast, or a bunch of Concord grapes lounging on a plate of chipped ice.\n           \n\n            It is confidence that lets some servers wear pale pink crew-neck T-shirts and others V-necks of a riper, fleshier pink. Confidence that helps them thread through tables that are by anybody\u2019s standards too close together; confidence that allows them to treat every customer, the ones who look like actors and the ones who look like retired semiotics professors, with the same attention and care.\n           \n\n            It is confidence that lets this French-looking bistro with its much-put-upon marble bar and fuzzed-up mirrors play Yo La Tengo one night and Whitney Houston\u2019s greatest hits on another and still believe that somehow it will all mean something.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 57, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/19/dining/prune-review.html", "google_mag": 23.0}, {"review_text": "\n            When a Korean barbecue place wants to set itself apart from all the other Korean barbecue places, it has essentially three variables to play with: meat, heat and sides. (In this way it is similar to American barbecue, which it otherwise doesn\u2019t resemble at all.)\n            \n             Cote\n            \n            , which has been wielding scissors and tongs on West 22nd Street since June, is resoundingly in the meat camp.\n           \n\n            Specifically, the meat that Cote grills is prime beef aged anywhere from a week to four and a half months in a cooler downstairs, next to a small lounge. Like\n            \n             Gallagher\u2019s\n            \n            , Cote hangs the sirloins, rib-eyes, hangers, skirts and so on behind glass so customers can inspect the inventory. Unlike Gallagher\u2019s, Cote floods the room with light the color of freshly spilled blood, making it look like a set from \u201cAmerican Horror Story: Steakhouse.\u201d\n           \n\n            The two dining rooms upstairs aren\u2019t nearly as gothic, although they are dark and moody. The walls are painted a deep blue-green, the floors are raw concrete, the tables are black soapstone. It is not exactly a date place \u2014 the hard surfaces amplify noise a little too well \u2014 but it is not exactly\n            \n             not\n            \n            a date place, either. People dress up to eat at Cote (it sounds like coat), perhaps because the Japanese-built yakiniku grills set into the center of the tables emit almost none of the smoke that can weave its way into your clothes after a night in one of the remaining barbecue palaces on 32nd Street.\n           \n\n            After taking cocktail orders (the ros\u00e9 slushie, decorated with a paper flamingo, tastes the way wine does when you are 8 years old), servers will offer a tour of the menu that ends with a strong endorsement of the \u201cbutcher\u2019s feast.\u201d This is a set menu, at $45 a person, with fluffy steamed eggs in a pot, two fundamental Korean stews, pickles, lettuce and, at the center of it all, a dealer\u2019s choice of four cuts of beef. After all that has been cleared, vanilla soft serve under a squiggle of soy caramel appears in little paper cups with little wooden spoons.\n           \n\n            The meats at my most recent butcher\u2019s feast were hanger steak, the reddish-purple of a brand-new bruise; a rib-eye together with a flap of rib-eye cap, both pink and spiderwebbed with white veins of fat; a thickish slab of flatiron steak, said to be the product of a cow who had Wagyu on one side of the family and Angus on the other; and finally galbi, short ribs in a sweet soy marinade. The other cuts in the butcher\u2019s feast vary but galbi is a constant, as it should be.\n           \n\n            The meats came out early, while the gas grill warmed up. The wire cage over it was primed with a cube of beef fat, and then the beef went on, one cut at a time. Our server turned the meat once, then walked away, and one of my guests started to worry that the meat would burn. But the flames were low, and the beef browned gradually.\n           \n\n            The gas burners at Cote will never give you the sharp, dark, crackling edges that you find in the charcoal-grilled meats at\n            \n             Mapo Korean BBQ\n            \n            in Queens (and almost nowhere else in the city). The beef, though, is in all likelihood the best at any Korean barbecue place in New York. Its two closest competitors for steak supremacy are probably\n            \n             Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong\n            \n            and\n            \n             Gaonnuri\n            \n            , and neither can match Cote for richness and concentrated flavor.\n           \n\n            One night I ignored the butcher\u2019s feast path and went off-road so I could try some sirloin that had been ripening downstairs for 138 days. Steaks aged that long are often described as funky, but the word doesn\u2019t cover this piece of meat. It tasted like something other than beef, or maybe beyond beef, more condiment than protein. At $80 for six ounces, it was not my cup of barley tea, but it may be yours.\n           \n\n            Next time, I\u2019ll stick to the road more traveled by. The butcher\u2019s feast takes in most of the menu\u2019s highlights, avoids the lowlights, and does so at a very good price for a steak supper.\n           \n\n            No matter what or how you order, though, you will have to contend with Cote\u2019s notions of when to serve the condiments and side dishes that make the difference between Korean barbecue and a heap of grilled meat. Pickled cauliflower and soy-marinated chayote (both very good), lettuce and ssamjang (the fermented bean paste) arrive as the beef starts cooking. Rice doesn\u2019t turn up until midway through the meal, when you\u2019re finally brought pickled daikon, kimchi, kimchi stew and fermented bean-paste stew. Gochujang may show up at the beginning or at halftime.\n           \n\n            There is no one right way to eat Korean barbecue, but people who like to bundle the meat into lettuce or shiso with a lump of rice and a pickled cabbage leaf will wonder why Cote parcels the side dishes out in stages.\n           \n\n            That isn\u2019t the only case of the missing kimchi. I couldn\u2019t taste it in the fried rice \u201cpaella\u201d with kimchi and Wagyu. The dish didn\u2019t have much in common with paella, either. I wouldn\u2019t care what it was called if it were delicious, but like some of the other attempts to loosen Korean custom, it came off as timid.\n           \n\n            Simon Kim, the owner, keeps saying in interviews that Cote is a Korean steakhouse. I understand why he wants to draw attention to the steak, but anybody who shows up expecting a kimchi-fied\n            \n             Smith & Wollensky\n            \n            is going to be very confused.\n           \n\n            You will search in vain for a baked potato or creamed spinach on David Shim\u2019s menu. You can, however, get a shrimp cocktail with gochujang cocktail sauce, an idea that\u2019s not as good as it sounds. You can eat an adapted wedge salad with candylike lumps of bacon and an unresponsive tofu-sesame dressing. And, in a homage to\n            \n             Peter Luger\n            \n            , there is bacon as an appetizer, which turns out to be unsmoked and uncured pork jowl. It\u2019s better with a smear of ssamjang, but then most everything is.\n           \n\n            More traditional Korean dishes tended to taste more complete. If you want more starch than rice alone, the skinny wheat noodles in hot anchovy broth are simple and delicious. Cold noodles stirred at the table with slivered apples, lettuce and gochujang are spicy, sweet and refreshing. There\u2019s a very good dolsot bibimbap, with a chewy bottom crust where the rice meets the searingly hot bowl.\n           \n\n            Aside from the meat locker, the other useful idea Cote borrowed from steakhouses is a wine list that is chosen with beef in mind and can run into real money if you\u2019re not careful. Anyone hoping to find a red for less than $100 will find that a quick glance at, say, California or the C\u00f4te d\u2019Or can be discouraging. But Victoria James, who wrote the list, found some pockets of affordability in Beaujolais, Southern France, Corsica and Switzerland, and she makes a small adventure out of the wines by the glass, all poured from magnums.\n           \n\n            Does Brouilly go with ssamjang? Can a Patrimonio get along with galbi? I didn\u2019t know I wanted answers to these questions before Cote came along, but now I do.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 58, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/dining/cote-review-korean-barbecue.html", "google_mag": 26.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n            At Jean-Georges Vongerichten\u2019s latest restaurant,\n            \n             Public Kitchen\n            \n            , the menu is supposed to have a theme: the food of New York City. Nobody I brought there noticed it, though. Somehow it slipped my mind, too, even though I\u2019d read about it weeks before my first meal, and had eaten things like smoked salmon and Manhattan clam chowder.\n           \n\n            The restaurant is all the way in the back of the ground floor of the new hotel on the Lower East Side designed by\n            \n             Herzog & de Meuron\n            \n            . The owner,\n            \n             Ian Schrager\n            \n            , calls it simply Public, and to make sure it lives up to its name he has divided the common areas into a sequence of hangouts.\n           \n\n            To get inside you walk down a hedgerow of rhododendrons flanked by two small lawns where hotel guests alight on Adirondack chairs as if they were up in the mountains and not a knish\u2019s throw away from Chrystie Street. The scene changes once you come through the revolving front doors to face a pair of escalators reflected off into infinity by polished metal mirrors. It may remind you of the entrance to a mall, and the tacit message is similar: Keep circulating until you see something you want.\n           \n\n            Around the escalators to the right you come to a Vongerichten-run grab-and-go market and beyond that, the first of two Vongerichten-catered bars. While the other offers snacky highlights from the Public Kitchen menu, this one serves the whole megillah. At the far end of the bar you reach the entrance to the restaurant. Strangely, it\u2019s one of Public\u2019s least interesting rooms, a yawning, noisy canteen whose walls are tiled with the same shiny marble that more expensive hotels put in their showers.\n           \n\n            I\u2019ve led you on this hotel tour to help make sense of Public Kitchen. The menu is a kaleidoscope because Mr. Vongerichten and Thomas McKenna, his executive chef, are trying to offer up something for many moods and occasions. Customers who don\u2019t grasp the I\u2665NY concept when they see pasta and pizza and Chinese food will still find something to eat, whether they\u2019re drinking mezcal below the Diego Rivera-inspired tapestry on the second floor or settling in for a couple of hours at the restaurant.\n           \n\n            One snack is so popular it\u2019s already a classic of sorts: popcorn under a thin Frisbee of fried Cheddar sprinkled with chives and chile flakes. I didn\u2019t totally get it, but it was a fun thing to crunch on with a drink in my other hand. So were the little latkes topped with sour cream, trout roe and smoked salmon, straight from the hors d\u2019oeuvres tray of the fanciest Hanukkah party you\u2019ve ever attended.\n           \n\n            Smart ideas pop up all over the place. Rigatoni with yellow wax beans and gold tomatoes is saved from ordinariness by a very good pesto in which pistachios do the work of pine nuts. Shrimp toast, one of those foods that are likable even when they\u2019re bad, is exceptionally good at Public Kitchen, where the crunch of water chestnuts is pitted against tender, unusually sweet shrimp.\n           \n\n            There\u2019s a phenomenally good steak marinated in soy sauce and dressed with fermented black soybeans and sesame oil. Also wonderful: roasted hake with sweet and spicy peppers interrupted by shards of fried potato.\n           \n\n            But, unusually for one of Mr. Vongerichten\u2019s recent restaurants, a number of dishes don\u2019t achieve liftoff. At my first meal I was nonplused by the shrimp cocktail: The shrimp were warm but served on ice, and the cocktail sauce was a bizarre and acidic collision of peaches and horseradish. The last time I went, these hot-and-cold shrimp weren\u2019t on the menu. I hope they are using their time away to think about the choices they\u2019ve made.\n           \n\n            Nothing else was so misconceived. But spicy avocado dip punched the lights out of a delicately flaky Chinese scallion pancake with basil in place of scallions. Nondescript cheese, bland mushrooms and a pointless egg dragged down a pizza with a very good, light crust. And Manhattan clam chowder, repurposed as a sauce for a fine, clean-tasting hunk of pan-seared salmon, was the answer to a question nobody asked.\n           \n\n            The only reason I can think of for hijacking red chowder like this is to make a connection with New York. But with a few exceptions, Public Kitchen doesn\u2019t explore the city\u2019s food in a coherent or illuminating way. And it doesn\u2019t come close to hitting, as the website puts it, \u201call of the cultures that make up the eclectic mix and melting pot that is New York City.\u201d Thai flavors animate one side dish, roasted carrots in red curry paste and coconut milk. But the main cuisines brought into play are Italian and Chinese, as if it were still 1970.\n           \n\n            A good menu doesn\u2019t need a theme to hang together, of course. The pastry chef, Eric Kalaboke, found a through line in slightly old-fashioned favorites like a fruit cobbler capped with sweet sticks of puff pastry, an extremely endearing chocolate layer cake with blackberry sorbet and peanut butter ice cream, and a quietly spectacular tartufo resting in sour-cherry syrup. As for the wine list, it does a great job of presenting reasonably priced bottles from all over, made by some of the leading producers in their regions. This is a nice surprise in a hotel that seems to have been built as a backdrop for the cocktail lifestyle.\n           \n\n            And if your big idea is New York City, you\u2019re probably better off underplaying it than going all out like\n            \n             the Grill\n            \n            , where they all but park a Checker cab next to your table. There are no lectures at Public Kitchen, blessedly, no footnotes or history lessons. The closest I got to an elucidation of the menu was when a server said, \u201cEverything is individually portioned and meant to be shared with the table\u201d \u2014 a Zen koan for our time.\n           \n\n            Still, it\u2019s a sign of trouble that what Public Kitchen is trying to pull off doesn\u2019t come across clearly. You can have a meal that is mostly very good, or one that is decidedly mixed, but either way you will probably walk out not entirely sure what sets this restaurant apart, other than Mr. Vongerichten\u2019s sensibility.\n           \n\n            He doesn\u2019t layer flavors like anyone else. These days he doesn\u2019t have as many imitators as he used to, either, although his spicy tuna tartare slicked with sesame oil will be with us forever. He trots it out again at Public Kitchen, over sliced avocado, with an undulated rice cracker that left oil on my fingers.\n           \n\n            It\u2019s hard to tell whether he\u2019s repeating himself, making a sly comment on how pervasive the dish is in New York, or both.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 59, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/dining/public-kitchen-review-jean-georges-vongerichten-nyc.html", "google_mag": 25.5}, {"review_text": "\n         ONCE you plow your way through the crowds struggling in vain to catch a bartender\u2019s eye at El Toro Blanco, you emerge into a dining room that might be in Santa Barbara during the last days of the Nixon administration. Ridged orange backs on half-moon banquettes stand up like a wall of Cheetos. Glazed brick walls in red and black flank curvy 1960s plywood chairs, dangling tangerine-colored pendant lights, and matadors painted on black velvet.\n        \n\n         El Toro Blanco\u2019s evocation of the last days of midcentury modernism is so spirited that you expect to see women in Halston pantsuits talking about EST while flicking More cigarettes over glass ashtrays the size of dog bowls.\n        \n\n         Restaurant designers can\u2019t fight the smoking ban, but what they can do is get across an idea. Even if you don\u2019t consciously register the intention of Meyer Davis Studio, the architecture firm that collaborated with El Toro Blanco\u2019s partners, John McDonald and Josh Capon, you can still feel it. The look of El Toro Blanco is the latest sign that in New York City, Mexican cuisine is cool, of the moment and ready to be presented without quotation marks \u2014 quaint ethnic folk crafts on the earnest side or, on the sloshy side, shot-glass bandoleers and blueberry margaritas.\n        \n\n         Admittedly, El Toro Blanco\u2019s interior makes the point more forcefully than its menu, assembled by Mr. Capon in consultation with Scott Linquist, a chef who has wrangled tamales at\n         \n          Dos Caminos\n         \n         in New York and\n         \n          Border Grill\n         \n         in Los Angeles. The main courses are on the mild side, and the sauces rarely achieve the profound interplay of heat, bitterness, smoke, fruits, nuts and spices that can make Mexican cuisine so rewarding. Balancing that, though, is the kitchen\u2019s emphasis on fresh flavors and its appealing lineup of street snacks and other appetizers.\n        \n\n         Tamales were probably never meant to be fluffy, but that didn\u2019t stop me from enjoying the airy forkfuls of steamed masa in the tamale oaxaque\u00f1a, covered with sweet plantains and shredded roast chicken in red mole, or in the lighter version with corn kernels and green strips of roasted poblanos.\n        \n\n         Empanada dough is rarely as thin and crisp as it is on the half-moons at El Toro Blanco, filled with tender short rib or with shrimp that seem to have twice their usual flavor.\n        \n\n         I refuse to choose a favorite among the three ceviches. I\u2019d rather just appreciate the lean, classic profile of red snapper in lime juice with jalape\u00f1o and cilantro, the depth that soy sauce brought to cubes of tuna with cucumber and avocado, and the way habaneros seemed to raise the temperature of a chilled coconut-milk broth for\n         \n          lobster\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         Lightness has its limits: the Sonoran\n         \n          cheese\n         \n         crisp, a thin flour tortilla beneath melted cheese, roasted\n         \n          tomatoes\n         \n         and threads of roasted poblanos, had a way of staying behind on its pizza stand while other things on the table disappeared. Like, for instance, the scalding pan of chorizo fundido, in which Mexico looks Switzerland calmly in the eye and says, \u201cI\u2019ll see your cheese fondue and raise you some green chiles and a heap of crumbled spicy sausage.\u201d (Switzerland folds and leaves the room.)\n        \n\n         Tacos didn\u2019t always deserve the extensive acreage on the menu they occupied. The tacos al pastor needed more heat to balance the sweet pineapple and unexciting pork, and whatever the chicken breast taco needed wasn\u2019t quite supplied by a sweet tomato-chipotle sauce. And a thick wad of stewed goat, while as tender and goaty as you might hope, called out for a bright or hot counterpoint, not just cheese and beans.\n        \n\n         But a squeeze of lime handily completed the tacos of lightly fried cod with slivers of radish, or better yet the ones with charred but still tender octopus tentacles that curled out of their folded tortillas like question marks that are really invitations.\n        \n\n         None of this is likely to alter your perceptions of Mexico, but put a few of these snacks together with a margarita on the rocks \u2014 the best, El Toro, is sweetened with orange juice and agave syrup, not liqueur \u2014 and the night will cruise along like a 707 to Acapulco.\n        \n\n         The energy can flag if you strike out for the bigger plates, though not if you order the lobster Puerto Nuevo, served split on its back with orange legs pointing in all directions. In the town of Puerto Nuevo, the lobster would be pan-fried in lard. El Toro Blanco grills it instead, and while I won\u2019t endorse this compromise, I have to admit that the melted butter seasoned with ground chiles de \u00e1rbol made me miss the pork fat a little less.\n        \n\n         Still, at times the restaurant seems to play to timid palates. The mole coloradito, which typically draws intrigue from cloves and cinnamon, is something of a fruit bomb, its sweetness landing with a thud on roast chicken breast that can tend toward dryness. A tomatillo salsa, one of three served with the bright guacamole, also gets more sugar than it can handle.\n        \n\n         Veracruz-style fish, usually cooked in a Mexican-Mediterranean blend of tomatoes, capers and olives, was pan-seared instead; the tomatoes, now more condiment than sauce, came across as strictly Italian. Grilled swordfish repeated the pattern: simply cooked seafood in the center of the plate, tomatoes on the side, Mexico disappearing around the bend.\n        \n\n         Most of the desserts won\u2019t bring it back, not the simple-minded apple empanada or the tapioca pudding or the chocolate tart. But a tres leches cake had a properly heart-stopping level of dairy overkill, and churros, crunchy with cinnamon sugar and scorchingly hot, were satisfying with or without a dip into dulce de leche sauce.\n        \n\n         Mr. Capon and Mr. McDonald are the creative minds behind\n         \n          Lure Fishbar\n         \n         and\n         \n          B&B Winepub\n         \n         , both of which manage to conjure quintessentially downtown scenes without benefit of a notably progressive menu. That these two men saw a future for themselves in Mexican food may not do much to move the cuisine forward. But style can have a substance of its own, and this may be the case when two restaurateurs convince New Yorkers that the centerpiece of a fun and stylish night on the town can be a plate of tamales.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 60, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-el-toro-blanco-in-the-west-village.html", "google_mag": 17.5}, {"review_text": "\n         The cry goes up around the restaurant.\n        \n\n         \u201cBa-luuuut!\u201d\n        \n\n         The word volleys from Jeepney\u2019s kitchen to its dining room as a server carries the hard-boiled duck egg to a man at the bar.\n        \n\n\n          \u201cBa-luuuuuuuuuuut!\u201d\n         \n\n\n         Grabbing the customer\u2019s hand, she whacks the flesh between his thumb and forefinger with a tablespoon to demonstrate the force needed to crack the balut\u2019s shell.

The unabashed embrace of a delicacy with major freakout potential is typical of the deep-end approach of\n         \n          Jeepney\n         \n         , a self-described \u201cFilipino gastro pub\u201d in the East Village.\n        \n\n         Another approach is on display about a mile south at\n         \n          Pig and Khao\n         \n         , which has a strong Filipino imprint, too. The two places have many things in common. Open since last fall, they are small, casual, fun and often loud \u2014 Jeepney with American and Filipino party rock, Pig and Khao with slow-rolling Southern hip-hop. Neither stocks hard liquor, but each still manages to shake up very entertaining cocktails. Recently, I\u2019m glad to report, both dropped their no-reservations policies.\n        \n\n         In their styles of presenting Asian cuisine, though, they go their own ways. Before opening Pig and Khao, Leah Cohen, the chef, spent a year eating and cooking in countries like Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines, where her mother was raised. Eating at her restaurant, I felt as if I were poring over an album of carefully edited postcards from her travels. Dinner at Jeepney, on the other hand, felt more like parachuting into Manila myself. I didn\u2019t know all the vocabulary and didn\u2019t always know what I was putting in my mouth, but I knew I had left home.\n        \n\n         I\u2019ve grown fond of both places, but I would take different sets of friends to each.\n        \n\n         For Pig and Khao, I\u2019d round up the ones who love Asian flavors, don\u2019t have significant hearing loss yet, think it\u2019s fun to get endless refills of beer from a keg in the back garden and won\u2019t be heartbroken to learn that fertilized duck embryos are not an option.\n        \n\n         They\u2019d be pork lovers who would go for the sugary chunks of Chinese sausage in a bowl of mussels first before dipping the so-so shellfish in a redeemingly aromatic, basil-scented broth of dashi, butter and yuzu.\n        \n\n         They would be delighted by a salad of watermelon cubes with strips of grilled pork jowl and golden puffs of fried pork rind. Like nearly every dish on the menu, it has enough crunch, salt and acidity to satisfy the most curmudgeonly judge on \u201cTop Chef,\u201d where Ms. Cohen came to national attention while she was cooking at\n         \n          Centro Vinoteca\n         \n         before taking over the kitchen there.\n        \n\n         Then they\u2019d see nothing wrong with moving on to another part of the pig\u2019s face with sizzling sisig, a modern Filipino classic. They\u2019d devour the chopped bits of pork \u2014 some crisp, some gelatinous, some meaty \u2014 seasoned with soy and slicked with the yolk of an egg cracked over the platter at the last minute.\n        \n\n         They wouldn\u2019t be fanatics about the authenticity of a menu that leans repeatedly on \u201ccrispy\u201d over less familiar words. When \u201ccrispy red curry rice salad\u201d turned out to be a less-spicy Thai pork larb tricked out with fragments of curried rice cooked into a crust, they\u2019d nod their heads over Ms. Cohen\u2019s talent for bright, clear flavors instead of quibbling. And when the adobo in \u201ccrispy quail adobo\u201d was not a stewing liquid, as it might be in the Philippines, but a rich soy and garlic sauce tossed with deep-fried quail, they wouldn\u2019t care.\n        \n\n         I didn\u2019t care, either.\n        \n\n         The friends I\u2019d take to Jeepney would be the explorers, the ones who see every meal as a chance to learn something.\n        \n\n         They wouldn\u2019t fume if it took three tries to bolt the restroom door. They wouldn\u2019t clutch their pearls at the sight of nipples on the back room\u2019s photomurals, one set belonging to the first Filipina to appear in Playboy, the other to the first in German Playboy. (When children show up, the staff applies discreet bands of tape.)\n        \n\n         The menu nonchalantly tosses out ingredients like sawsawan and bagoong as if they were peas and carrots, and these friends would listen as the high-spirited servers explained it all.\n        \n\n         They\u2019d pay $7 more for an extra marrow bone to supplement the impressive one that rides on top of a short-rib and vegetable soup called bulalo. They would mash the marrow with a fork into a lump of jasmine rice, then drink the deeply restorative broth from their bowls and ladle some into mine.\n        \n\n         If they came on a Thursday, when Jeepney puts away the utensils and plates and serves dinner on banana leaves, they\u2019d wash their hands and get right down to business.\n        \n\n         They\u2019d mold jasmine rice around bits of longanisa sausage; strips of tocino, pork that the chef, Miguel Trinidad, cures in 7Up; and cubes of pork stewed in a fascinating chocolate-colored sauce of beef blood, bay leaves and vinegar. Facing fried crabs saut\u00e9ed with garlic, they would crack open the shells and excavate the meat with their fingers.\n        \n\n         Would they eat balut? Maybe.\n        \n\n         Would I? I did. The liquid on top tasted, yes, like chicken broth; the yolk was chalky; parts of the white were confusingly hard. As for the little embryo, it gave way to the spoon as easily as custard and tasted something like duck liver mixed with duck breast. If you didn\u2019t grow up eating balut, it probably helps to stop thinking about the feathers.\n        \n\n         Jeepney\u2019s batting average could be higher. A dish called the Defeated Chicken, with nondescript roasted chicken in adobo sauce, defeated me, too, and the slow-roasted pork shoulder in one called Bicol Express had been cut across the grain into short, dry strands.\n        \n\n         But the people I\u2019d take there know that discoveries require both trial and error. If they prefer the reliable rewards of skillful cooking edited for New Yorkers, I\u2019ve got a restaurant for that, too.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 61, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-jeepney-in-the-east-village-pig-and-khao-on-the-lower-east-side.html", "google_mag": 19.399999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n            One thing that sets Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone apart from other very talented chefs is how happy they seem to be creating restaurants that are not about them, or even primarily about cooking. While their peers were putting their kitchen skill front and center, through tasting menus or through restaurants where decoration was minimal and amenities were pared back until there was almost nothing left but the plates, they went in the opposite direction.\n           \n\n            From their first restaurant, Torrisi Italian Specialties, inside a fake Italian grocery store, their places have been highly distracting in ways that serious chefs tend to shun. The interiors are ornamental and over the top; the servers are dressed in uniforms that we might as well call costumes; the playlists are what your friend for whom entertaining is a life-or-death matter would put together for a highly specific theme party.\n           \n\n            Other chefs would have worried that their precious food would be overshadowed by the rest of the production. Mr. Torrisi and Mr. Carbone always seemed confident that wasn\u2019t going to happen. Before they opened their Japanese restaurant,\n            \n             the Lobster Club\n            \n            , they were right.\n           \n\n            Now two months old, the Lobster Club is the third and final stage in the annexation of the Seagram Building\u2019s dining spaces by the\n            \n             Major Food Group\n            \n            , run by the two chefs and Jeff Zalaznick. The first two stages were\n            \n             the Grill\n            \n            and\n            \n             the Pool\n            \n            , carved out of what used to be\n            \n             the Four Seasons\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            The Lobster Club sits under the Pool in a space that was originally a 24-hour brasserie. Vintage East Siders such as\n            \n             Peter Marino\n            \n            , the architect who designed the Lobster Club, still talk about dropping into the Brasserie for onion soup after writhing the night away at Studio 54.\n           \n\n            Mr. Marino apparently wanted to bring the party back. From the top of the stairs just inside the entrance, on East 53rd Street, a scene from Fellini seems to be playing out. A big square lounge in the middle of the room is bounded by zebra-striped panels of white ebony. Spurts and dribbles of paint cover the floor and the black trousers that some of the servers are wearing. It looks as if Jackson Pollock were called back for one last job.\n           \n\n            On the walls are prints Mr. Marino made from paintings he owns. The originals were painted by Richard Prince, modeled on paintings by Picasso. The Prince Picasso-painting prints have themselves been painted, gone over by Mr. Marino with thick pigment in a completely different style.\n           \n\n            Marvin Gaye is singing. He wants everybody to know that sexual healing is something that is good for him.\n           \n\n            Round tables are surrounded by pink lounge chairs that look, from behind, like enormous cartoon lips. The booths are upholstered in a chartreuse camouflage pattern, a useful fabric if the Army ever needs to hide in a green neon jungle.\n           \n\n            Blending in at the Lobster Club in winter means fur coats and designer sweaters. A man with silver hair, a double-breasted blazer and a pocket square is circling the perimeter, swiveling his head, an eager expression in his eyes, as if he had been told there would be a limbo pole. On the right, a big group is sitting around a skinny table that can be partitioned from the rest of the dining area by drawing a floor-to-ceiling curtain, as in an operating room. The curtain is made of black leather.\n           \n\n            All the bartenders are dressed like leather daddies.\n           \n\n            Isaac Hayes is singing now. He has some thoughts to share about a black private dick who\u2019s a sex machine to all the chicks.\n           \n\n            What kind of Japanese restaurant is this?\n           \n\n            It would need to be a sensational one to compete with the rest of the goings-on. It is not. In fact, the Lobster Club seems to be making an effort not to be sensational. The cooking, as a whole, suggests Japanese food as seen through American eyes at some point in the recent past.\n           \n\n            There is no soup, no noodles, no tofu and few vegetables. But there is salmon teriyaki, made more meticulously than any I\u2019ve ever seen, with a dark-pink medium-rare core and a translucent, unsyrupy glaze.\n           \n\n            The core of the menu is steak and seafood cooked on a teppan, the steel grill introduced to the United States by the original\n            \n             Benihana\n            \n            , which by the way is still in business a few blocks away. Not that Lobster Club is an explicit homage. If its cooks are juggling spatulas and flipping shrimp into the air, they are doing it behind closed kitchen doors.\n           \n\n            My Wagyu skirt steak was a far better product than anything I remember from Benihana. Ditto the teppanyaki king mushroom stems that accompanied it along with more shishito peppers than I needed and more sauces than I can name. The mustard miso was my favorite with steak; for grilled scallops, I would go with the yuzu chimichurri.\n           \n\n            Tasuku Murakami, the executive chef, was highly regarded during his time behind the counter at\n            \n             Sushi Azabu\n            \n            , in TriBeCa. He has his seafood shipped in from Japan, including seasonal treats like black-throat sea perch and tiny white shrimp called shiro-ebi. He, or one of his followers, carves it with finesse and sets it over a wad of rice that I wished were a little warmer and more strongly vinegared.\n           \n\n            The style is very traditional, except for the rolls that combine, say, fried oysters with Wagyu. The \u00e0 la carte prices are on average slightly higher than at slightly better places such as\n            \n             15 East\n            \n            . It would be silly not to try some sushi at the Lobster Club, and just as silly to travel there for it.\n           \n\n            Two skewered appetizers were among my favorite things on the menu. One is the pork belly, lightly browned on the grill and then half-buried under a chopped pineapple sauce. The other is the tsukune, or chicken meatball, which is richer than you expect thanks to an unadvertised, invisible but very noticeable addition of foie gras.\n           \n\n            Some of Mr. Murakami\u2019s appetizers struck me as barely Japanese at all. Certain raw fish dishes could be served at any number of New York restaurants, like slices of sea bass showered with brittle strands of fried brussels sprouts, or raw cherry trout twirled around crunchy nests of fried potato threads. Both are fine things to eat, by the way. The one called wok lobster \u2014 battered and fried lobster tail pieces in a sweet-and-sour sauce \u2014 seems very Chinese. It is also very oily, like the fried rock shrimp and the teppanyaki garlic rice, which will ooze oil as you watch.\n           \n\n            \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to remind me of\n            \n             Ruby Foo\u2019s\n            \n            ,\u201d said a stranger who stopped by my table on her way out. (This kind of thing is always happening at the Lobster Club.) I think I knew what she meant. If you order the wrong things the food can be surprisingly heavy, and no matter what you eat you can\u2019t quite avoid a sense that this place doesn\u2019t take its supposed inspiration as seriously as it could.\n           \n\n            Then again, it is one of the only places in the city where you can end a meal with steamed black-sugar cakes, soft and homey and rarely seen outside their hometown, Okinawa. And it is among the few to serve kakigori, a mountain of shaved ice. Stephanie Prida, the pastry chef, soaks it with blood orange-syrup on one side and condensed milk on the other.\n           \n\n            As soon as one table orders it, everybody else in the vicinity wants one. I\u2019ve never seen anybody finish it.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 63, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/dining/the-lobster-club-review.html", "google_mag": 30.299999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n         The age of French dining in New York that\n         \n          blossomed\n         \n         in the unpromising soil of the Corona ash dumps during the 1939 World\u2019s Fair, at the French Pavilion\u2019s restaurant, seemed to come to its close about 10 years ago as mastodons like Lut\u00e8ce lumbered into the fossil record. Today, that seems less like the end of an epoch than a salutary cooling-off period.\n        \n\n         If you are having trouble getting a reservation at a new place this year, odds are high that the menu is speckled with accents grave, acute and circumflex.\n         \n          Dirty French\n         \n         is turning away customers at the door. Keith McNally sent frogs\u2019 legs marching to the rescue at\n         \n          Cherche Midi\n         \n         after his pizzeria there fizzled. And just north of Washington Square Park, at an address that had started to look like a certain restaurant-killer, the doors at a new Proven\u00e7al spot called\n         \n\n\n          Claudette\n         \n         have been thrown open to reveal closely packed rattan chairs, none of them empty.\n        \n\n         Claudette\u2019s charms are many and begin with those doors, which replace the woebegone sidewalk enclosure that used to make it look as if nobody were home. Losing a few seats has made reservations harder to land, but the reward is that the doors have let in the atypically cool breezes all summer, along with a view of lower Fifth Avenue\u2019s wide, leisurely sidewalks, where somebody is always walking a bichon fris\u00e9.\n        \n\n         Inside,\n         \n          Claudette\n         \n         looks like an expensive summer rental that is being used as a French street-corner cafe. (Rattan connects the two motifs.) The beach rental aesthetic is supplied by the whitewashed tables, throw pillows and shelves lined with books that are arranged by color and separated by anonymous knickknacks. Contributing to the cafe look are the compact bar and the winning cast of aperitif cocktails, which all seem to be named after\n         \n\n\n          Roger Vadim\n         \n         \u2019s wives. Small, gentle and very appealing, the Brigitte and her cohorts cheerfully buck the trend toward potent, convoluted cocktails that don\u2019t know how to behave at the dinner table.\n        \n\n         Claudette\u2019s food follows the example of the aperitifs; it is light, approachable and unlikely to impair your ability to stand up at the end of the meal. If you are in the mood for an intelligent salad, Claudette has plenty: green beans and vinegared hearts of palm with heaps of fresh mint; a nest of freshly shredded zucchini, still crisp under its anchovy vinaigrette; a crunch-fest of raw radishes and snap peas tugged in an unexpected, intriguing direction by cumin.\n        \n\n         Even less expected was the cinnamon-laced raz al hanout spice blend dusted on the bistro-style fries. More brushes with North Africa lay ahead. Claudette makes an unleavened, layered flatbread, similar to traditional kesra, that is good when hot from the griddle, especially with a thick smear of pistou. (I couldn\u2019t see the point of another spread, the bland and expensive hummus with chopped truffles.)\n        \n\n         Gradually, it becomes clear that Claudette\u2019s chef, Wade Moises, and chef de cuisine, Koren Grieveson, have made a smart decision about\n         \n\n\n          Provence\n         \n         . Rather than treating it as if it were frozen in time and sealed off from the world \u2014\n         \n          Peter Mayle\u2019s \u201cA Year in Provence\u201d\n         \n         repeated forever \u2014 they cast a few glances at the North African immigrants who live and cook there.\n        \n\n         Claudette\u2019s owners, Carlos Suarez and Mark Barak, were traveling in Provence when, like many English-speaking tourists, they fell under the sunny spell of Lourmarin. They had a charmed meal in that town at a restaurant founded by Claudette Sammut, a Frenchwoman who lived in\n         \n\n\n          Tunisia\n         \n         until the 1950s. Before it was over, they had asked her family if they could take her name back to\n         \n\n\n          Manhattan\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         They brought her bouillabaisse, too, an eccentric white version that has a puff-pastry hat and lemon juice but no tomatoes and an undetectable quantity of saffron. I was not as smitten by its tenaciously sour broth as they were. As a sauce for the monkfish, baby octopus and shellfish, it might get by, but as a soup, it lost its appeal after a few spoonfuls, and even sooner the time it was oversalted.\n        \n\n         A somewhat more successful souvenir from Lourmarin is the pieds paquets. Traditionally an all-day stew of sheep\u2019s trotters and tripe, it has been de-trottered for New Yorkers. Or, as a server with an oratorical flair put it, \u201cwe absented the feet for cleanliness of flavor.\u201d What we get instead are tripe-wrapped bundles of pork shoulder braised in white wine and tomatoes. Tender but polite, they are upstaged by the grilled bread, fantastic when dunked in the expanse of rust-colored sauce.\n        \n\n         As the absented feet suggest, Claudette\u2019s exploration of Provence can be undercut by its impulse to play it safe, to water down the pastis. Braised chicken thighs on a bed of nutty toasted bulgur arrive in a tagine, but they aren\u2019t cooked in one. When servers lift the glazed lid, the mint and other aromatics don\u2019t rush into your lungs the way they would in Tangier. The tiny dab of harissa doesn\u2019t go far, either. But the chicken is moist and well browned, the sauce gets sunny Mediterranean sweetness from oranges, and for complexity and originality, the dish leaves the other main courses in the shade.\n        \n\n         After making its opening moves so gracefully, Claudette grows oddly clumsy at the end. The most reliable dessert is the pistachio cake sandwiching a layer of citrus cream, smartly accompanied by candied orange peel. But a chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me with harissa was grainy, and a supposed bread pudding of chocolate-almond croissants looked and tasted exactly like a stack of stale pastries.\n        \n\n         Most of the time, though, the kitchen does what it sets out to do, even if it seems to be holding back. If Mr. Moises and Ms. Grieveson choose to dive a bit deeper into their vision of an African-tinged Provence, they could make the Gallic revival more interesting by cleaning the dusty windows of nostalgia through which New Yorkers like to view French cuisine.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 64, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/dining/restaurant-review-claudette-in-greenwich-village.html", "google_mag": 22.700000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n         Reading the opening lines of\n         \n          Hearth\u2019s last review\n         \n         in The Times, published in 2004, is like strolling among the headstones in New York\u2019s vast restaurant graveyard. The critic at the time, Amanda Hesser, observed that one-word names had become fashionable, and gave recent examples:\n        \n\n         Ilo. Tappo. Beppe. Gonzo. Pazo. Pico. Salt. Fresh. Supper. Canteen. Commune. District. Town.\n        \n\n         These establishments, more than half of Ms. Hesser\u2019s roll call, didn\u2019t last.\n        \n\n         Hearth did.\n        \n\n         It thrived not because it cruised along in the tail winds of a nomenclature fad, but because it diligently looked the other way as fads came and went. The same potato gnocchi wallowing in a wading pool of melted butter that Ms. Hesser praised will be on every second table tonight. Everybody else will get the same rich but not filthy-rich polenta, although the ground corn is now typically grown in upstate New York, not\n         \n\n\n          South Carolina\n         \n         . Returning again this fall are the same improbably long bands of handmade pappardelle that drink the braising juices of a fine duck rag\u00f9. If you woke up shivering because you went to sleep with a window open and the temperature dropped 30 degrees overnight, this is the bowl of noodles you want.\n        \n\n         From the start, Marco Canora, Hearth\u2019s chef and, with Paul Grieco, its owner, set out to adapt the transparency of Tuscan cooking to his own region and time of year. He gets few points for the originality of his vision. But for his fidelity to it, Mr. Canora\u2019s score is off the charts. By all accounts he is in the kitchen on East 12th Street almost every night, even as he and Mr. Grieco have replicated their wine bar next door,\n         \n          Terroir\n         \n         , in four other neighborhoods.\n        \n\n         As Hearth approaches its 10th anniversary next month, you can tell the kitchen is paying attention most of the time. Not always: one night the gnocchi would have had no flavor if not for the melted butter and grated cheese on top. Dry, stringy salt cod mantecato needed more richness, and it was stuffed in a bitter roasted yellow Hungarian pepper that needed more sweetness. Siobhan DeCarlo\u2019s desserts were variable, too. I had a nearly perfect cardamom panna cotta with a coffee-caramel sauce one night, and a dry, drab pear spice cake with almost no hint of spices on another. I noticed the lapses because they were so out of character, like\n         \n\n\n          John Boehner\n         \n         vaping on an e-cigarette.\n        \n\n         In the dining room, though, inattention was closer to normal. The servers seem friendly enough, smiling in their plaid shirts and bluejeans with napkins peeking out of the back pocket. But all my meals could easily have been finished 45 minutes sooner, without rushing. While I waited for somebody to take an order, or bring the main course, or clear dirty dishes, there were pauses long enough for several species of Amazonian frogs to go extinct.\n        \n\n         Ordering wine wasn\u2019t always simple, either. Once when I asked a server about a wine, she admitted she didn\u2019t know much about it but promised to find out. Instead she came back 10 minutes later with the bottle; we were halfway through our main courses by then, so we didn\u2019t stop her from opening it. Any restaurant can get into the weeds, but the weeds at Hearth seem especially fast-growing and luxuriant.\n        \n\n         If I had been alone, I would have passed the time reading\n         \n          Mr. Grieco\u2019s wine list\n         \n         . This passionate, garrulous, name-checking manifesto exhorts us to drink mead (\u201ca true symbiosis between insect, nature and man\u201d), urges us to drink riesling (\u201cTo say that Riesling is great is as obvious as saying\n         \n\n\n          Vladimir Putin\n         \n         is the Michael Corleone of\n         \n\n\n          Russia\n         \n         \u201d), pleads with us to drink sherry (\u201cthe most underrated beverage on the planet earth\u201d) and revises the lyrics to a\n         \n\n\n          Justin Timberlake\n         \n         song (\u201cIt\u2019s my wine in a box, my wine in a box babe\u201d), twice.\n        \n\n         The tension between Mr. Grieco\u2019s confrontational wine list and Mr. Canora\u2019s soothing menu is one of the springs that keeps Hearth in motion.\n        \n\n         Another is Mr. Canora\u2019s understanding of the seasons. Once a vanguard notion in the United States, cooking with seasonal ingredients is so mainstream that chefs of all stripes practice it, from the modernist gear heads to the New Nordic foragers who can tell you exactly when to pick toothwort roots.\n        \n\n         But chefs who plug this week\u2019s ingredients into a style of cooking that stays the same all year long, who incorporate pumpkin and pheasant into their gels and streusels and cantilevered fronds asymmetrically disposed on just one side of the plate, seem to forget that it isn\u2019t just the farmers\u2019 market that changes with the seasons. Our appetites change, too.\n        \n\n         One night in June, when restaurants in the East Village had their doors thrown open and the neighborhood took on a relaxed, unhurried mood, I ate a salad that put me in the same kind of mood: sweet, firm, bright-green favas and bits of soft young pecorino, dressed with vinaigrette and chopped parsley.\n        \n\n         In early fall, I ate just-cooked canestri, like bent rigatoni, tossed with braised cauliflower and wilted Tuscan kale; on top were toasted bread crumbs that stayed crisp until the pasta was gone, which bread crumbs never do when I make them. What made the crunch of the crumbs, the chew of the noodles, the long, mellow flavors of the vegetables so satisfying was the way they filled a hunger I wouldn\u2019t have felt a month earlier.\n        \n\n         Even though Mr. Canora rarely has more than two pastas on the menu, that\u2019s what comes to mind when I think of Hearth. I also picture the platters for two. The spatchcocked chicken with flavor in every scrap of its flesh and golden skin, the whole roasted fish stuffed with lemon and rosemary, and the c\u00f4te de boeuf are all treated like the classics they are. Unlike other restaurants, where trendy platters for two are an old-fashioned opportunity for price gouging, Hearth sells the chicken and fish for about as much as two regular main courses. For the beef, which could probably feed three, $125 isn\u2019t out of line.\n        \n\n         Hearth received two stars from Ms. Hesser, who praised it for what she called \u201cgood, familiar food given a little luster.\u201d After 10 years it\u2019s easier to see that familiarity as Hearth\u2019s path to timelessness.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 65, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/30/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-hearth-in-the-east-village.html", "google_mag": 22.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n            I can\u2019t remember what we were eating at Toro, the new tapas restaurant in far western Chelsea, when one of the people at my table looked up in wonder.\n           \n\n            It could have been when we were swaying like drunken sailors over the suquet de mariscos, a chowder by way of Catalonia with cool sea urchin and warm lobster bobbing in parsnip-infused milk. Or when we had finished the last shrimp in the gambas al ajillo and were scraping up the last bits of a sauce for which a tank full of lobsters must have given their shells.\n           \n\n            Or when we were crunching through croquetas of ham mixed with unmistakably earthy meat from a pig\u2019s head. Or when we were cutting into another croqueta, this one filled with unusually fluffy and moist salt cod sitting under two golden hoops of fried lemon peel. Or when we had emptied a sardine tin of its raw mackerel marinated in a Thai-derived green curry, rich with coconut milk and sharpened with lime juice.\n           \n\n            But I remember his smile and his question: \u201cHow can a place this big have food this good?\u201d\n           \n\n            Toro, opened in September by the chefs Ken Oringer and Jamie Bissonnette and based on their enduringly popular Boston original, has factory-height ceilings, an industrial-chic design and 120 seats at long communal tables and smaller, unshared ones. It isn\u2019t all that large compared with\n            \n             Morimoto\n            \n            across 10th Avenue, or\n            \n             Buddakan\n            \n            on the east side of the same building, or the teeming mess halls of the meatpacking district a few blocks south. By local standards, it is a bungalow in a neighborhood of McMansions.\n           \n\n            But by the cozy standards of the Barcelona tapas joints that inspired Mr. Oringer and Mr. Bissonnette, Toro might as well be a Home Depot. It sells almost as many items. The beverage list alone is a major treatise on Spanish drinking.\n           \n\n            There are spins on Spain\u2019s beloved gin and tonic, dressed up with lemon grass syrup or yellow Chartreuse, although my Vauvert Elixir was a bit flat and cloying, as if the tonic came from a bartender\u2019s hose. More inviting at the start of a meal are the feisty and autumn-crisp hard ciders or the cavas, a few of which settle any doubts that Spain is making world-class sparkling wine. Moving beyond bubbles, Toro stocks the garnachas and tempranillos you\u2019d expect, but it has discoveries in store, too, from underappreciated grapes like xarel-lo and mencia.\n           \n\n            You may need a drink before ordering dinner, because the menu gives you something like 60 choices. Some are fully traditional Spanish classics like toast spread with raw tomatoes that shimmer with olive oil; others are non-Iberian interpretations like yellowfin tuna in white soy sauce with tissue-thin vinegared cucumbers.\n           \n\n            This presents a corollary to my dinner companion\u2019s question: How can a menu this big have so many excellent dishes, and so few disappointments?\n           \n\n            I\u2019ve certainly tasted things at Toro I wouldn\u2019t be in a hurry to order again. One November night, I stayed cool to several dishes that could have used more warmth themselves. Chilly deviled eggs were somewhat generic despite being topped with a slip of preserved tuna belly. A $36 plate of streaky jam\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rico should have been warmer, too, to help soften the flavorful fat. This was an oversight I didn\u2019t expect from a restaurant that goes to the trouble of hand-slicing the tagged Spanish hams that it proudly hangs from the ceiling. And while I loved the way mint yogurt brightened the wintry sweetness of rutabagas, sunchokes and carrots in a vegetable paella, I had no luck finding the socarrat, the crunchy bottom layer of browned rice that our server had promised would be the best part. The pan had been hustled off the flame before the crust had set.\n           \n\n            But there were fewer misfires each time I went, suggesting that the kitchen is settling down to business. I was happy to sink into the profoundly Spanish flavors of a vegetable stew called escalivada, with smoked eggplant in olive oil that carried the sweetness of simmered red peppers and onions. I immediately wanted more of the hot blowfish tails seared in a crust of North African spices. And I wondered how the simple combination of potatoes, octopus, harissa and charred onions could result in a contender for the best octopus dish in a city that\u2019s gone cephalopod-mad.\n           \n\n            The octopus and blowfish gave me a hunch that later meals confirmed: The seafood at Toro can be spectacular. Can be, but not always: A whole sole griddled on a plancha could have used a kick of acid or salt, while delicate threads of sea cucumber were kicked around by acrid bits of over-fried garlic.\n           \n\n            But griddled red shrimp from Galicia were wildly delicious, from the tips of their tails to their heads packed with buttery orange fat. A blood-red run of fresh-pressed cranberry juice made an exciting vinaigrette for oysters, briny and raw. The clams, mussels and shrimp in paella Valenciana had plenty of character, and this time that irresistible layer of golden rice had fused to the pan. There were delicious oddities, too, like softly springy cod stomach flavored with some intensely funky stuff from inside the head of an octopus; it occupied its own wonderful niche between mild and extremely weird.\n           \n\n            A third question: Would this food taste even better if the place weren\u2019t so big?\n           \n\n            Tapas in Spain are intimate, convivial bites. They\u2019re snacks, sometimes running into meals, that you eat during hours when you fall into a bar for an hour or two of purposeless hanging out. New Yorkers aren\u2019t so good at that. We eat tapas in restaurants where the casual, offhand moment of unplanned deliciousness gives way to the wait list, the crowds, the reservation before 6 or after 10, the upsell, the table smilingly offered with the condition that \u201cwe\u2019ll need it back in an hour,\u201d as a host at Toro told me one night.\n           \n\n            To their credit, Mr. Oringer and Mr. Bissonnette do not cook as if they are in a huge restaurant. Toro\u2019s food isn\u2019t stagy or gimmicky; it\u2019s honest and thoughtful, and it can feel a bit lost in this space. There are times when eating tapas here is like watching card tricks at Yankee Stadium.\n           \n\n            And if I ever want to try some of these dishes in a smaller room, I can just go to Boston.\n            \n             The original Toro\n            \n            is less than half the size, and for the eight years it\u2019s been in business, people haven\u2019t stopped complaining about how hard it is to get a table.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 66, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-toro.html", "google_mag": 24.200000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n         Restaurants hide in all kinds of ways. There is the coy, unmarked-door hiding of the neo-speakeasy. There is the romantic hiding of restaurants whose positioning at, say, the end of an alley allows men to seem clever and their dates to seem impressed. There is the snooty hiding of exclusive restaurants that behave like private clubs, an affectation that is going out of style and won\u2019t be missed.\n        \n\n         Then there is Botequim, a fine new Brazilian restaurant that seems to have been hidden away against its will in the basement of a hotel on Fourth Avenue.\n        \n\n         You descend to Botequim in one of two ways. The first is weird. You walk into\n         \n          the Fourth\n         \n         , the street-level all-day restaurant of the\n         \n\n\n          Hyatt\n         \n         Union Square New York, past disoriented travelers at the bar, and take the stairs that unwind beneath a dangling helix of children\u2019s beds suspended from the ceiling. The second is weirder. You open a glass door on Fourth Avenue that says\n         \n          Botequim\n         \n         \u2014 so far, so good \u2014 and descend a staircase that deposits you in a backstage area between the kitchen and the dining room. Taking this route one night, I landed in the middle of a hushed, tense conference between two employees, who fell silent when they saw me. I felt like Lord Grantham stumbling upon a downstairs bitchfest.\n        \n\n         The hotel\u2019s efforts to keep Botequim out of sight since its September opening may account for the half-full dining room. Once you make it inside, though, things quickly start to look up. Graffiti-style murals zigzag across the walls, samba rhythms ripple all night long, and a glass of cacha\u00e7a is never more than a few minutes away; the bartenders upstairs will shake it with muddled lime hulls for a classic caipirinha or stir it with a cube of frozen coconut water, a stupefyingly simple drink that I will be copying at home next summer. Most of all, Botequim has Brazilian food, under the direction of the chef Marco Moreira, that is too good to be trapped in a basement.\n        \n\n         To start, have a few globes of p\u00e3o de queijo, Brazilian cheese puffs that are something like goug\u00e8res crossed with mochi. Springy and lightly chewy from tapioca flour, they are delicious eaten in alternating bites with toothpick-speared lengths of grilled calabresa sausage, spicy and tinged with garlic. Or with a plate of pastelzinhos, wonderfully crisp turnovers whose thin pastry shells are not even a little bit doughy. Some are filled with cubes of unmelted cheese from the state of Minas Gerais, and you may need to come from there yourself to appreciate its squeaky blandness. But the pastelzinhos holding ground beef with tomatoes and olives are instantly lovable. So are the rough and flaky fried croquettes of salt cod, light but not insubstantial. They come with a lemon emulsion, which is to be ignored in favor of a few potent drops of the bright-red hot sauce made on site. It\u2019s terrific stuff.\n        \n\n         The main courses make it obvious, if it wasn\u2019t already, that Botequim\u2019s kitchen cooks with far more finesse than the remaining restaurants of\n         \n\n\n          Manhattan\n         \n         \u2019s Little Brazil or the outposts of those all-the-grilled-meat-you-can-eat chains that turn up every few years and are never as much fun as they sound. Mr. Moreira, who with his wife and business partner, Jo-Ann Makovitzky, owns Botequim along with\n         \n          Tocqueville\n         \n         and\n         \n          15 East\n         \n         , was raised in S\u00e3o Paulo. The kitchen is in the hands of Jason Hall, his chef de cuisine, but you can tell that Mr. Moreira put considerable care into the recipes. He may have lightened some of\n         \n\n\n          Brazil\n         \n         \u2019s more bruisingly rich dishes, but he kept the flavors true.\n        \n\n         Botequim\u2019s cube of suckling pig plays a recurring role in one of my hungry daydreams, in which I break the thin roof of crackling skin into chips to scoop up swirls of lime-brightened pork, soft enough to serve as a dip. In other idle moments between meals, I flash back to the short rib, roasted in extremely slow motion until a dark and satisfying crust wraps around woozily tender meat. It\u2019s like smokeless barbecue, and once I had tried it, I stopped flashing back to Botequim\u2019s roasted top sirloin, called the Brazilian, a fine steak but ultimately just a steak.\n        \n\n         My private visions of moqueca may feature a more varied mix of seafood than black sea bass and a single prawn. But the coconut-tomato broth in this Bahian stew would taste a lot like Botequim\u2019s, with every mouthful slicked by a palpable slug of red dend\u00ea oil. And when I imagine feijoada, it looks the way it did my first night at Botequim, when it was loaded with smoked pork and sausages and the black beans tasted as if they, too, were on the verge of turning into meat. On a second try, it was more soup than stew, and the beans tasted like beans. Maybe it was just the luck of the ladle.\n        \n\n         The high point of dessert was always a tres leches-style coconut cake grandly slouching under the weight of all the milk and cream it had soaked up. When I tried anything else, the meal never ended as well. Sonhos, the doughnut holes whose name means \u201cdreams\u201d in Portuguese, had an undreamlike heaviness, though a quick dunk in guava sauce helped. For reasons I can\u2019t imagine, the rice pudding, which was allegedly made with bananas and passion fruit, tasted like stewed onions. And my coffee, which seemed like a sure thing in a Brazilian restaurant, was awful, a thin and watery broth. If you want a drink with dessert, try some sherry from Roger Dagorn\u2019s list, which is strong in all departments, down to the rarely seen Brazilian beers.\n        \n\n         But weak coffee and iffy desserts can be fixed; they\u2019re no reason to hide Botequim away from people looking for dinner along Fourth Avenue. Mr. Moreira and Ms. Makovitzky also operate the Fourth and a whiskey and wine bar called\n         \n          Singl\n         \n         , both on the street level. I don\u2019t know anything about the hotel business; if I did, maybe I\u2019d understand why hotels have such strange ideas about spelling. But a bar seems like a natural inhabitant for a snug room in the basement. My message to Mr. Moreira: Set the moqueca free! Let the cod fritters come upstairs!\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 71, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/24/dining/restaurant-review-botequim-in-the-east-village.html", "google_mag": 25.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n         Only half of the tables inside Kao Soy were taken, but the delivery guys were coming and going through the door on Van Brunt Street every few minutes. The December wind off the harbor that was shaking the little brick buildings in Red Hook,\n         \n\n\n          Brooklyn\n         \n         , was keeping everybody at home, ordering pad see ew and massaman curry from the new neighborhood Thai place.\n        \n\n         This turned out to be lucky for me. Five minutes later, I was facing down a platter of shrimp with skinny dried chiles over torn lobes of sweet pomelo that had a flaky coating of toasted coconut and crushed peanuts. Soon after that came a big bowl of rice noodles, shrimp and round Asian eggplants in a mild green curry that seemed to get more and more appealing. This arrived with a separate plate of dried anchovies, boiled eggs with almost-solid yolks and a fresh red chile sauce that had definite intent to harm.\n        \n\n         Then the kao soy turned up, the dish I\u2019d come to try. This is a pale-yellow coconut milk curry from\n         \n\n\n          Chiang Mai\n         \n         with submerged noodles and a chicken leg, and, above the surface, fried egg noodles going off in all directions with strands of green-papaya fritters. There was another condiment plate for the kao soy, of course. I was eating all of this as fast as I could, and as the overall deliciousness began to sink in I started eating even faster. It wasn\u2019t fast enough, though, and soon the plates covered every inch of available surface area and I needed to slide an empty table next to mine.\n        \n\n         In fact, I ran out of space every time I went to Kao Soy. Some blame must be given to the plates, which are vast white things with rims almost as wide as\n         \n          the sidewalks on Park Avenue\n         \n         . Some goes to\n         \n\n\n          Thailand\n         \n         , where a meal may start with half a dozen salads and sticky rice, and where even the condiments seem to have condiments. Some goes to the tables, which are not built for this kind of thing. Most, though, goes to Kao Soy\u2019s menu for inducing me to order too much (except that it was never too much) by offering Thai dishes I rarely see around town, including a few from northern Thailand.\n        \n\n         Those of us who prowl restaurants whose owners come from countries known for delicious food harbor an irrational belief that one day, if we play it right, we may get the Other Menu. This is the one the owners save for their family and friends. It\u2019s the one that lists all the foods they loved back home. It\u2019s filled with the dishes everybody says Americans won\u2019t like. Nobody I know has ever seen one of these documents. That hasn\u2019t stopped me from raising my eyebrows and dropping key foreign phrases in the hopes that a server will say: \u201cOh, you want the Other Menu? Just a moment, sir.\u201d\n        \n\n         At Kao Soy, the Other Menu is printed on the same green page that lists the dishes you know from your local Thai spot: the fried rice, the pad thai, the curry with choice of chicken, beef, pork or shrimp. Those items fill the shopping bags that go out the door every few minutes. They help keep the business floating. But the mission of Kao Soy is to sell New Yorkers on what Sirichai Sreparplarn, one of the restaurant\u2019s two chefs, calls \u201cthe real food from the north.\u201d\n        \n\n         Several New York neighborhoods have been wrapped in the fiery clutch of Thailand\u2019s northeastern region, Isan. Dishes from the north, though, have been found almost exclusively in one place,\n         \n          Pok Pok Ny\n         \n         , just outside Red Hook. This puts two northern Thai kitchens less than a mile apart in a borough that is home to only about 12 percent of the city\u2019s Thai population and virtually no other Thai restaurants worth knowing about.\n        \n\n         Kao Soy was opened last summer by Kanlaya Supachana, who has worked in several Thai restaurants around Brooklyn, answering phones and such. She and her co-chef, Mr. Sreparplarn, close friends for many years, had what he calls \u201cthe same passion for serving real flavor to New Yorkers,\u201d but they failed to persuade any existing Thai restaurants to share their vision. Finally a local contractor, Carlos Padillo, agreed to sign on as Ms. Supachana\u2019s business partner, and they took over a tiny space, filled it with a few tables, a tiny bar and an electric fireplace.\n        \n\n         The northern Thai dishes are scattered around the menu. Most obvious is the excellent kao soy, made in the style of Ms. Supachana\u2019s father back in Chiang Mai. Beneath the heading Snack & Salad is a dish called nam prik ong. This is a platter of steamed cauliflower, long beans, strips of fried pork rinds curled like Fritos and long surfboards of romaine lettuce, all meant as garnishes for a dip that\u2019s something like a spicy, slightly sweet pork rag\u00f9 that went for a swim in the ocean. Or maybe the dip is the garnish; it was gone before I\u2019d decided.\n        \n\n         A related dish, sai oua, is filed under Various. The dip here has been pounded from garlic, onions and fresh green chiles, hot ones. For dipping, you get steamed young mustard greens, cucumbers, freshly fried pork (not rinds but meat this time, and marinated in soy), along with a house-made pork sausage, the sai oua itself. Deeply perfumed with makrut lime leaves, coriander roots and lemongrass stalks, this sausage makes a more complete single-bite introduction to Thai flavors than any plate of pad thai.\n        \n\n         For the time being, we reach the end of the northern Thai menu with the banana blossom fritter and the kang hung le, a warmly spiced peanut curry cooked with pork belly and beef. A fried drumstick comes on the side, and you are meant to pull off some dark meat, pinch it with sticky rice and then scoop up some of the curry. I didn\u2019t understand it, but I loved it anyway.\n        \n\n         But we have not reached the end of the Other Menu, because there are other less-familiar dishes under the Snack & Salad or Various headings. Few are dull, and some are very good, like the shredded mango salad with cashews and two kinds of dried fish, no longer than a toothpick.\n        \n\n         Kao Soy isn\u2019t quite finished yet, Ms. Supachana will say.

I love their food and their music and their boots. I admire their ability to tame landscapes that are hostile to human life. I respect how quick they are to stick up for their state and its culture. In fact, I may be slightly afraid of Texans. I have no desire to mess with them. I can read the bumper stickers.\n        \n\n         Reviewing\n         \n          Javelina\n         \n         , which bills itself as \u201cNew York\u2019s first authentic Tex-Mex restaurant,\u201d may have presented me with an unusual conflict of interest. My interest in telling the truth about this establishment could come into conflict with my interest in not having my butt kicked by angry Texans. What if something I didn\u2019t like at Javelina turned out to be the very thing that Texans most love about authentic Tex-Mex? It may get in the way of my earnest desire for my next trip to\n         \n\n\n          Texas\n         \n         to be a safe and peaceful one. Lucky for me, I have only good things to say about Javelina.\n        \n\n         Javelina, near Union Square, is a godsend for anybody who loves to eat before 6 p.m. or after 9:30 p.m.; since opening two months ago, the restaurant has been talked up so much in the press that those are usually the only reservation times available, even if you book a week or two ahead. You may worry that at those hours the dining room would be depressingly quiet, but that\u2019s not the case. Javelina\u2019s 58 seats always seem to be taken by large groups of people shouting with youthful animation. It always sounds as if somebody were telling a woman at the far end of the table that he had just found $1,000 under the menu, and the woman were shouting back that\n         \n\n\n          Ryan Gosling\n         \n         had just texted and he\u2019s coming to the restaurant in, like, five minutes!\n        \n\n         How anybody gets drunk enough to act this way is one of several fun Javelina mysteries to keep you entertained. Fresh or frozen, the margaritas have a slight chemical taste that I was thankful for because it tended to keep my own alcohol intake to near-Mormon levels. I also stayed alert and sober when faced with the\n         \n\n\n          Tijuana\n         \n\n\n\n          Manhattan\n         \n         , made with tequila in the place of whiskey and served in a rocks glass with no ice at all, even though it was the temperature of a freshly killed snake. While bartenders elsewhere have become insufferable bores on the subjects of ice and proper shaking techniques, the ones at Javelina are refreshingly free of such pretension. Even the water is sometimes served at room temperature.\n        \n\n         One night, the bar made me a Paloma in a pint glass, while a woman at my table got her Paloma in a much smaller glass. Everybody knows women drink less than men, so we appreciated the thoughtfulness. To avoid making her self-conscious, I suppose, the restaurant even charged us both the same amount, $13.\n        \n\n         At most restaurants, you are served what you ask for so routinely that your eyes glaze over with boredom. Javelina does not fall into the trap of dull predictability. One night after I left, I realized the guacamole I\u2019d ordered had never arrived; it\u2019s not every restaurant that gives you something to think about on your way home. Meanwhile, people at the next table were presented with a dish they insisted they hadn\u2019t asked for. \u201cYou didn\u2019t order brisket?\u201d the server asked, keeping up the playful spirit.\n        \n\n         One of Javelina\u2019s calling cards, queso, is usually suggested by the servers when taking orders. Occasionally this Tex-Mex cheese fondue is served hot, but more often it arrives lukewarm, which prevents trips to the emergency room. The cooler temperature offers the added benefit of allowing a latex-like film to congeal on top, which provides an interesting contrast in texture with the liquefied cheese below.\n        \n\n         Queso is short for chile con queso, so named for the hot peppers that are stirred into the melted cheese. Javelina\u2019s traditional yellow queso is supposed to be flavored with serranos, while a white version is said to come with both jalape\u00f1os and roasted poblanos. But spicy food can be hard for many people to digest, so I am relieved to report that both colors are quite bland.\n        \n\n         A premium queso called the Bob Armstrong does have some flavor: It tastes like ground beef, which in fact it contains, along with guacamole and chopped tomatoes. The menu said that another loaded queso, the Mag Mud, was supplemented with black beans. I didn\u2019t see them, so I probed the cheese with tortilla chips, digging way down to the bottom. Black beans shouldn\u2019t be easy to lose in a bowl of white cheese. Where were they? About five minutes later, a server placed a bowl of beans on the table. \u201cThis is supposed to go with the queso,\u201d he said. Mystery solved!\n        \n\n         The chef is Richard Caruso, and his menu looks unmanageably long, but fortunately only a few items on it are worth getting. Puffy tacos, a\n         \n\n\n          San Antonio\n         \n         specialty, come out well, with bits of pork shoulder and other taco toppings piled into a deep-fried corn tortilla, crisp outside and soft in the middle. The steak enchiladas are good, too, with a mouthwatering sour-cream sauce all around them. The cilantro-cream gravy around mahi-mahi is comfortingly thick and rich, and the fajitas are just what you\u2019d expect them to be, with one difference: The flour tortillas are outstanding.\n        \n\n         Every time I went to Javelina, in fact, those flour tortillas were the best thing on the table. Tender, yielding, pressed in the kitchen and freshly browned on a comal, they are both thicker and lighter than the kind most places use as packing tape to seal up burritos. They are so good that if you happen to accidentally order the tacos filled with pale, cold brisket that tastes more like boiled pork than beef, you can simply tear off chunks of the tortilla and eat them on their own.\n        \n\n         Corn tortillas are used in the enchiladas de Tejas, and they really made me appreciate how good the other tortillas are, because these are as stiff as a new pair of jeans. They were filled with equally sturdy melted cheese and blanketed with a chile sauce that would make a wonderful way for Mexican cooking teachers to show students what happens when you try to toast dried chiles and end up burning them instead.\n        \n\n         There is no dessert menu, so every table is supposed to get a plate of sopaipillas, on the house. I got mine once out of three visits, just the right ratio to bring a\n         \n\n\n          tremor\n         \n         of anticipation to the end of the meal.\n        \n\n         The best news of all, for anybody who hates waiting around to settle the tab: There is no need to ask for the check. It is dropped without warning as soon as the last dirty plate has been cleared, and sometimes even earlier.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 73, "rating": "Fair", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/dining/restaurant-review-javelina-in-gramercy-park.html", "google_mag": 31.0}, {"review_text": "\n            \u201cWhenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth, whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul,\u201d Herman Melville wrote, \u201cI account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.\u201d\n           \n\n            I feel you, Herman.\n           \n\n            In my line of work, grimness of the mouth sets in after I\u2019ve eaten too many things that are trying so hard to impress that they lose touch with anything that comes close to pleasure. And each time I see a roomful of people handing hundreds or thousands of dollars over to a chef who stopped caring a long time ago, my mood turns distinctly Novemberish.\n           \n\n            Whaling jobs being harder to come by than in Melville\u2019s day, my sea voyages usually take the form of a short ride to a cheap restaurant where warm flavors from another part of the world will burn off my interior drizzle. Recently, these rides have ended at\n            \n             Chomp Chomp\n            \n            in Greenwich Village for radish cakes, noodle soups with transporting powers, coconut rice, triangles of golden beef-filled roti wet with curry sauce, and other treats from the food courts of Singapore.\n           \n\n            These are not the franchise-studded cul-de-sacs that fill American malls with hypertrophied cinnamon buns and microwaved despair. Singaporean food courts, better known as hawker centers, are lined with stalls whose proprietors make a small number of dishes, or just a single one, over and over. The appeal of Chomp Chomp, which the chef and owner, Simpson Wong, named after one of the country\u2019s most magnetic hawker centers, is that you can eat your way from stall to stall without leaving your seat.\n           \n\n            If Chomp Chomp were an actual hawker center, I\u2019d be an expert on finding the line for carrot cake. No carrots were harmed in making it. Daikon radish cakes, similar to the turnip cakes rolled round on dim sum carts everywhere, are fried with little shrimp, garlic chives and slivered arcs of sweet Chinese sausage. Singaporeans, some of the most food-obsessed people on earth, are extra obsessed with this dish, and for good reason.\n           \n\n            Warm, fresh oysters the size of quarters are softly cooked into an omelet, seasoned with soy sauce, fish sauce and garlic chives. Oh luak, it\u2019s called. The omelet has been doused with chile-spiced vinegar, and there is a small pile of minced garlic on the side. Simple, unthreatening flavors, but eaten together they make it hard to stay grim about the mouth.\n           \n\n            Both of these are called snacks on the menu. So are the fried whole prawns breaded with cornflakes and curry leaves (just try it, O.K.?); the salad of cucumbers, mango, shrimp fritters and other things that you stir into a deliciously funky-fishy sambal; and the very good five-spice chicken rolled up with taro inside a tofu skin wrapper.\n           \n\n            Spider webs of light glow behind the carved wood lattices of Chinese temple doors hanging on Chomp Chomp\u2019s walls. They are new to this dining room, but the schoolroom chairs with metal book racks under their molded seats are carried over from Wong, the same chef\u2019s last restaurant in this space. They are comfortable enough for the first 20 minutes. It doesn\u2019t matter much. Dinner moves quickly. Servers weave in and out from tables to the kitchen, where, behind bamboo shades at half-staff, cooks clack away at smoking woks.\n           \n\n            Noodles stir-fried with shrimp and soy sauce, called char kway teow, produce far more happiness than you\u2019d expect from something that looks like shrimp lo mein. The appearance of another stir-fry, nyonya chap chye, is deceptive, too. Clear rice noodles jostled together with tofu and mushrooms, the dish has almost no color and a mild flavor, but the more you eat the better it gets. The Hainanese chicken rice is another sleeper; it tastes like much more than slices of soy-lacquered chicken over rice cooked in chicken broth.\n           \n\n            Many dishes are married to their own dedicated condiments. As melamine plates start to mingle around the table, these spouses can become estranged. Try keeping them together; urge them into counseling if you have to, because Chomp Chomp\u2019s condiments are all different, some spicy, some tart, a little shrimp paste here, a little plum sauce there, and energy everywhere.\n           \n\n            There\u2019s no separating barbecued stingray steamed in banana leaf from its spicy and wonderfully intense sambal, which is daubed thickly on top of the fish, then sinks into it. (Like many in Singapore, Mr. Wong substitutes skate to good effect, but keeps the traditional name.)\n           \n\n            How much of Chomp Chomp\u2019s food would attract long lines in Singapore? I\u2019m not sure. For specialists working in hawker centers, mastery becomes second nature through repetition. With around two dozen dishes on the menu, Mr. Wong\u2019s kitchen may not get enough practice to turn out a heart-stopping version of any one of them. Flavors can go slightly out of focus from night to night. Lamb rendang was pasty, dry and a bit muffled at one meal. The next time, it was juicier and so richly curried I could almost believe it was cooked in the \u201cmillion spices\u201d advertised on the menu.\n           \n\n            A durian cream puff, which the menu once ominously advised you to try \u201cat your own risk,\u201d is now a special only when Mr. Wong can get fresh durian. The remaining two choices are bananas fried in a mochi-like batter or sweet potatoes and taro bobbing in a warm coconut-tapioca soup. As vegetable soup desserts go, it is excellent.\n           \n\n            A special one night, a potent glop of sea cucumber, mushroom and pork belly, reminded me happily of the wonderfully lunatic sea-cucumber Bolognese from Wong, where the chef indulged his creative impulses. At Chomp Chomp, the goal is faithful translation, and the potent glop turns out to be a genuine hawker dish.\n           \n\n            The everything\u2019s-better-in-Queens crowd will no doubt argue that you can eat some of the same things for less at Malaysian restaurants outside Manhattan. Not quite the same things, I\u2019d answer. Much of the menu is strictly Singaporean, and some of its Malaysian dishes have a Singaporean edge. Mr. Wong also picks his ingredients with unusual care. Try the kerabu sotong, a squid salad with a spicy Malaysian dressing. Taste how crisp and juicy the peppers and tomatoes are, how tender and sweet the squid.\n           \n\n            Not that I\u2019d talk anyone out of eating Malaysian food in Queens. Go to Queens, go to the Village, go to sea. Go anywhere you need to go to keep November in its place.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 74, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/04/dining/chomp-chomp-review.html", "google_mag": 26.600000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n            My one-sentence review of Lilia for the too-long-didn\u2019t-read crowd: Missy Robbins is cooking pasta again.\n           \n\n            That is all you need to know before you begin plotting a night at this casual Brooklyn restaurant with Manhattan-level underpinnings.\n            \n             Lilia\u2019s menu\n            \n            has many other very good things, but pasta made by Ms. Robbins is a direct route to happiness that has been shut off to New Yorkers since she left the two\n            \n             A Voce\n            \n            restaurants in 2013.\n           \n\n            Slip a fork into the pappardelle with veal Bolognese. Shiny with just enough herb-flecked sauce that one noodle peels away from the rest as you lift, they are rolled so thin that they\u2019re almost weightless. Taste them, and you notice their delicacy along with the naked simplicity of the chopped veal gently cooked into tenderness with dark and meaty dried porcini. There is no milk in this Bolognese and no tomatoes apart from some juice, but nothing is missing.\n           \n\n            Stab an agnolotto, bring a parcel of sheep\u2019s milk ricotta and feta in gorgeously supple yellow dough to your mouth. It\u2019s been rolled in melted butter with honey and saffron threads. The perfume is subtle but insistent, and when it threatens to be too much, you bite into a soft dried tomato. Why did everybody turn against dried tomatoes? At the right time, they\u2019re wonderful, and this is one of those times.\n           \n\n            The ricotta gnocchi are tender cheese dumplings that seem to be held together by nothing but the force of Ms. Robbins\u2019s will. Their sauce is a crunchy pesto of broccoli and pistachios, spring-green and exciting.\n           \n\n            The ruffled edges of long belts called malfadini carry melted butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano with the peppermint tickle of pink peppercorns. Some sources call this shape \u201cmafaldine\u201d and say it is named after a\n            \n             Princess Mafalda\n            \n            . Our server said the word meant \u201cbadly cut,\u201d but this can\u2019t be right. There is no badly made pasta at Lilia.\n           \n\n            Like\n            \n             Barbuto\n            \n            in the West Village, Lilia inhabits the shell of an old garage. This one, in Williamsburg, is full of bleached wood and white furniture that seem chosen to reflect the sun coming through the windows and skylights in the early evening.\n           \n\n            And as with Barbuto, the food is Italian, confident and coursing with energy. The intent of every dish seems to be making you glad you\u2019re there. Ms. Robbins gets across her points using only a few ingredients that haven\u2019t been contorted out of shape. She has the assurance of a chef who has been at it long enough that Barack Obama was a fan of her cooking at\n            \n             Spiaggia\n            \n            in Chicago before he was the president.\n           \n\n            Now proprietor of her own shop, she stands each night at a bend in the counter separating Lilia\u2019s dining room and kitchen. To her right is a wood-burning grill that runs as hot as a forge. The cooks stationed in front of it look as if they are baking in their jackets, like potatoes. They gulp water from plastic quarts, enduring the heat while out at the tables, eyes go wide over the flavors coming off the flames.\n           \n\n            One night, there was a quietly smoky chicken leg under spicy olives mashed with capers and brightened with mint leaves. There were thin stems of broccoli rabe, too, tasting unusually sweet against the olives. You could eat this once a week, and it would not stop tasting new.\n           \n\n            Another night brought a flank steak of veal wearing fresh herbs and olive oil. It had been grilled to the soft pink of medium-rare pork, but its flavor was more precise and nuanced. I wish more restaurants would find veal of this quality and cook it so simply and well.\n           \n\n            But meat is a minor motif. Grilled seafood is a major one, second in importance only to pasta. The menu separates it into \u201clittle fish\u201d of appetizer size and \u201cbig fish,\u201d which aren\u2019t all that big; they\u2019re normal main courses.\n           \n\n            One of these, grilled black bass with exceptional little roasted potatoes, was spread with a really energetic salsa verde that got extra lift from tarragon. Raisin- and sage-fueled Marsala (remember Marsala?) had the right amount of sweetness and zip for a juicy white hunk of swordfish.\n           \n\n            Under little fish, my favorite turned out to be sardines given a semisweet and citrusy cure, then laid over grilled crostini spread with soft butter. Sardines and butter are a great combination, and here they got along even better than usual.\n           \n\n            Some grilled scallops got a bit lost in an excess of yogurt-walnut dip. But tender grilled baby squid held their own on top of whole sweet tomatoes, cured and marinated, and so did tiny grilled clams in a tangy dressing of Calabrian chiles.\n           \n\n            The antipasti don\u2019t always look like antipasti. Most of them are vegetables, some presented like salads (grilled fennel with blood oranges) and others like side dishes (roasted squash with a sticky caramelized surface bathed in brown butter).\n           \n\n            The bagna cauda, vegetables crowded around a warm dip that, excellently, contains a huge dose of anchovies, is a more traditional antipasto. So is the prosciutto listed under \u201cCocktail snacks.\u201d You drape it on bread that you spread with butter that\u2019s been creamed with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. Then you dab it with pickled mustard seeds soaked in balsamic vinegar. Then you shake your head a little at how smart Ms. Robbins is about augmenting classic Italian flavors without stepping all over them.\n           \n\n            Desserts follow that template. The olive oil cake is luxuriously rich, with a satisfyingly browned crust. A tart of crisp sliced apples is excellent, too. I wasn\u2019t expecting much from soft-serve gelato with mix-and-match toppings, but a swirl of vanilla under a spoonful of walnuts preserved in lemon syrup tasted exactly right.\n           \n\n            Lilia is the first and, for now, only restaurant owned and operated by Ms. Robbins. This makes it something of a rarity: the sole focus of a midcareer chef who has the maturity to stay away from trends and novelties, the experience to know what will be delicious, the managerial skill to pull it off, and the time to make it work.\n           \n\n            It\u2019s hard to begrudge her peers\u2019 decisions to leverage success into sprawling empires. Then when you eat at Lilia, it\u2019s hard not to wonder if the rest of us are losing something in the bargain.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 75, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/30/dining/lilia-restaurant-review.html", "google_mag": 28.899999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n            When serious, reputation-making restaurants run out of room on the walls to hang all the awards, chefs open a cheaper, more casual restaurant nearby.

Wildair borrows its format from contemporary European wine bars such as\n            \n             Manfreds & Vin\n            \n            in Copenhagen and\n            \n             Le Dauphin\n            \n            in Paris, places that extend a hand inviting us to try something new, drink a strange gamay bottled by an ornery old hermit, eat a little of this and a little more of that while we catch up, unwind and make plans. You visit Contra. Wildair is a restaurant you can live in.\n           \n\n            The food isn\u2019t necessarily better, but it\u2019s often more inventive. You wouldn\u2019t guess that from scanning the menu, reading down from oysters and cheese to fried squid and steak. Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske are serving familiar, likable food. But instead of tying them down, this seems to have given them permission to lift off with extra altitude.\n           \n\n            The squid is fried along with sliced lemons and sections of green onion. Everything is contained in a golden shell that is implausibly light and crunchy, with no hint of sogginess. Potato flour mixed with masa is the secret of the batter. A garlic-powered squid-ink aioli gives the dish some staying power.\n           \n\n            The secret of Wildair\u2019s white shrimp with celery is probably the shrimp themselves, netted off the coast of Georgia. But the kitchen augments their unmistakably wild flavor by patiently stewing them in garlic-piment\u00f3n oil, heads and all.\n           \n\n            On my first two outings at Wildair, I passed up the pork rillettes, suspecting that they were outsourced. They are not. They are beautifully made on site, smooth and pinkish and creamy in a glass bowl sealed with a white blanket of fat. I spread the rillettes on thin toast and took a bite, letting the fat and its warm, holiday flavor of ginger and other seasonings melt on my tongue.\n           \n\n            I almost skipped the lettuce, too, suspecting that it was lettuce. I was right about that but wrong about skipping it. With squiggles of butter-and-caramelized-lettuce dressing insinuated into its folds and some chopped pistachios on top, the sweet Little Gem lettuce makes for one of those ideal salads that is as complicated as it needs to be and no more.\n           \n\n            The dream date for that lettuce would be the dry-aged Wagyu steak, slick with melted beef fat and so tender it doesn\u2019t seem entirely real. It might have made me dizzy if I hadn\u2019t already been reeling over the price, $70 for roughly 25 ounces of meat, sliced from the bone, that two companions and I ate while luxuriating in the oak-and-steel embrace of Wildair\u2019s stools. (The discomfort is more acute at the narrow counters on either side of the dining room.)\n           \n\n            For the average mortal\u2019s budget, the beef tartare is a more accessible lettuce partner. Chopped into bits that are big enough to chew, the meat is crunchy with toasted buckwheat, hot with fresh horseradish, and sharp with gratings of tangy smoked Cheddar.\n           \n\n            Though the two chefs seem liberated by\n            \n             cooking for a simple wine bar\n            \n            , this freedom sometimes leads them off the path. Wet blobs of below-par sea urchin had no business glopping up an excellent potato cake I ate in the early summer. The texture of whole clams and flabby cubes of lardo over griddled bread with spinach wasn\u2019t as appealing as the flavor. The kitchen may also want to cut the squid and green onions into smaller pieces; you want to eat them with your fingers, but they\u2019re so big you almost need a knife and fork.\n           \n\n            Mr. von Hauske is the baker of the two. The dense white sourdough with the fantastically crisp crust that he makes at Contra is sold at Wildair, too, this time with a dish of salted olive oil that catches nicely in your throat. For dessert, he has come up with a very likable panna cotta; the sweetness comes from soft shavings of watermelon granite and a crumble of caramelized milk. There\u2019s also a chocolate-peanut butter tart that tastes exactly the way I\u2019ve always wished a Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cup tasted.\n           \n\n            One sign of how well Wildair works is that nearly everybody I know who has dropped in has a story about discovering a new wine. The central character in most of these stories is Jorge Riera, the wine director here and at Contra and a soft-spoken but ardent advocate for winemakers who believe in letting nature have its way. I owe him for introducing me to a biodynamic fino sherry from Andalusia and an elegantly honeysuckle-scented grenache blanc from Catalonia, among others.\n           \n\n            Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske named their wine bar for a prizewinning racehorse that lived in the neighborhood before the Civil War. Mr. von Hauske believes it should be pronounced \u201cwilled air,\u201d but almost everybody calls the place \u201cwild air.\u201d Maybe everybody is wrong, or maybe this is just a case of a younger sibling claiming its own identity.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 76, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/07/dining/restaurant-review-wildair-on-the-lower-east-side.html", "google_mag": 24.600000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n         Any Hawaiian honeymooner who\u2019s been off the plane for more than an hour can tell you that poke rhymes with O.K. and that tuna poke typically means raw ahi cut up and mixed with soy sauce, seaweed and so on.\n        \n\n         But the people at the next table were stumped when they saw it on the menu of\n         \n          Noreetuh\n         \n         , which has been offering tastes of Hawaii in the East Village since March.\n        \n\n         \u201cWhat\u2019s poke?\u201d one of them asked, rhyming it with Coke.\n        \n\n         After a silence, a man sitting with her spoke up. \u201cIt\u2019s a fish,\u201d he said. Pause. \u201cA kind of tuna.\u201d\n        \n\n         This exchange suggested some of the challenges facing Noreetuh\u2019s chef, Chung Chow, along with his partners, Jin Ahn and Gerald San Jose. Island seafood and produce fill the walk-ins at contemporary Honolulu restaurants like\n         \n          MW\n         \n         or\n         \n          the Pig and the Lady\n         \n         , but they rarely reach the island of Manhattan. A knowledgeable audience can\u2019t be imported, either. While islanders can be counted on to know exactly which local dish Alan Wong is playing around with, the average New Yorker has almost no idea\n         \n          what the residents of the 50th state eat\n         \n         . Don\u2019t they like \u2026 Spam?\n        \n\n         Sure, among other things. Mr. Chow, who was raised in Hawaii and cooked at\n         \n          Lincoln Ristorante\n         \n         and\n         \n          Per Se\n         \n         , goes out of his way to treat Hormel\u2019s arrestingly pink canned meat product as if it were an heirloom ingredient. Stuffed into supple agnolotti and accessorized with hon-shimeji mushrooms; semi-juicy, soy-cured spring almonds; and a mob of bonito flakes (waving their hands in the air like they just don\u2019t care), it could almost pass for mortadella.\n        \n\n         It may be the most elegant dish on Mr. Chow\u2019s menu, although it gets stiff competition from the monkfish liver torchon, a pink button surrounded by jellied passion fruit. Lightly pickled pears soften the passion fruit\u2019s brassy tendencies. Mash the fruit and fish liver together on a sweet dinner roll from\n         \n          King\u2019s Hawaiian bakery\n         \n         , and you have one of the most exciting tastes to wash up on Manhattan\u2019s shores this year.\n        \n\n         With prime ingredients, carefully organized plates and nonviolent menu prices, Mr. Chow seems intent on making Hawaiian classics presentable for their introduction to New York. Four or five garlic shrimp stand side by side on a long column of rice, offering the same pleasurable assault of garlic-flecked butter that you\u2019d get from a big messy pile slopped onto a paper plate by one of the shrimp trucks of Oahu. And however you pronounce it, Mr. Chow\u2019s poke is classical, generous and slightly Japanese-leaning, made from firm, cool bigeye tuna, diced and slicked down with sesame oil. Frills of seaweed carry the heat of tobanjan, the spicy Japanese bean paste.\n        \n\n         Neatness counts for only so much, though, and some dishes are more fastidious than flavorful. The pork in panko-crusted croquettes isn\u2019t very emphatic, and the katsu sauce on the side needs more kick, too. A different poke, with octopus and fingerling potatoes, has only a flicker of the tuna\u2019s personality. White asparagus looks very nice alongside crumbled Chinese sausage and chopped eggs, but the combination doesn\u2019t go very far.\n        \n\n         Noreetuh has plenty of dishes for a successful first visit. Dinner will be particularly fun for wine lovers because Mr. Ahn has compiled an overachieving list of German rieslings, Burgundies in both colors, grower Champagnes and more far-flung treats. Better still, the prices are low; just by sticking to your budget, you can drink at a higher level than usual.\n        \n\n         Noreetuh may have a trickier time converting new diners into regulars, though. The two dining rooms, while tasteful enough, don\u2019t have anything you could really call atmosphere. Noreetuh means \u201cplayground\u201d in Korean, and the owners seem to want to give a party. But where did they find their DJ.? A Motown hit parade is followed by \u201cYellow Submarine,\u201d and then by Taylor Swift, Natalie La Rose and, gosh, is that really Taylor Swift, twice in one night?\n        \n\n         At the moment, there\u2019s something a little cautious about the whole enterprise. But the last time I went, I ate a bowl of spaghetti, new to the menu, that points in the right direction. Richly oily smoked butterfish was folded in among buttered noodles, bright orange with fiery little capsules of spicy cod roe. This wasn\u2019t a polite exercise in cultural diplomacy; it was a shut-up-and-eat dish, and if a third Taylor Swift song had played right at that moment, I wouldn\u2019t have cared.\n        \n\n         Another small, modest looking restaurant called\n         \n          the Eddy\n         \n         sits right around the corner, on East Sixth Street\u2019s disappearing row of interchangeable curry spots. The Eddy is so small and modest looking, in fact, that after it opened last spring, I almost decided not to review it at all, on the theory that when a restaurant has just over 30 seats and doesn\u2019t seem to have any trouble filling them, there isn\u2019t much point in driving more people there.\n        \n\n         The chef is Brendan McHale, and I wasn\u2019t always sold on his cooking. I would have liked some of his dishes better if they hadn\u2019t reminded me of slightly better things I\u2019d eaten elsewhere, like the burrata served, as at\n         \n          Estela\n         \n         , in an herbaceous puddle of chlorophyll. Others, like the strangely bloated gnocchi or the dull, spongy lamb loin served with pellets of teff spaetzle that looked like rabbit feed, were easy to forget.\n        \n\n         But other dishes were wonderful. There were unimprovable roasted potatoes with strips of rib-eye whose dry-aged intensity was amplified by the low-key funk of melted Brie. And the soft-shell crab with a peppery arugula pesto that I kept eating after the crab was gone. And the jiggly, just-set cardamom panna cotta with crystals of rhubarb granit\u00e9 on top. And the airy chips of fried beef tendon, spread with Greek yogurt and dotted by smoky trout roe. Like Mr. McHale\u2019s bacon tater tots, which wear little bright-green berets of pur\u00e9ed sweet peas, the tendon puffs disappeared with a crunch and left behind a strong desire for more. I would say that both hors d\u2019oeuvres were smart cocktail party food, but I have never been invited to a cocktail party this smart.\n        \n\n         And then I thought about how extremely pleasant everybody is at the Eddy, starting with the bartenders, who look up and smile each time a new customer walks in, as if they lived in the opening credits of a sitcom. I remembered the drinks they made, which are as good as the ones at a dedicated cocktail bar. I recalled the compact well-priced wine list, and how I never picked a bottle that I didn\u2019t enjoy a little more than I\u2019d expected.\n        \n\n         When I went back to the Eddy, I noticed how quickly the people I brought settled in and got comfortable under the timbered rafters and low ceiling that make the dining room look like a well-kept old tavern. And how easy it was to hear one another, even when the place was crowded.\n        \n\n         The Eddy, in other words, is one of those restaurants that gets so many little details right that your main course can be a little shaky and you can still walk out happy. That\u2019s a rare thing, no accident when it happens, and the reason all those seats are so often full.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 77, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/24/dining/restaurant-reviews-noreetuh-the-eddy-in-the-east-village.html", "google_mag": 29.5}, {"review_text": "\n            I\u2019ll get to the heftier items on\n            \n             Oiji\n            \n            \u2019s menu. I\u2019ll praise the pine-smoked mackerel that a mackerel-conscious friend and I have been emailing each other about for a month now. I\u2019ll reminisce about the bowl of buttered rice and stewed beef that seemed boring at first and then not boring at all. I\u2019ll try to explain what makes the bubble-cluster of crust on the fried chicken so good. All in due time, all in due time.\n           \n\n            First, I need to tell you about the honey butter chips.\n           \n\n            As faithful readers of the South Korean dailies know, about a year ago the snack company Haitai introduced the country to a new potato chip flavored with \u201csweet, sweet honey from beehives\u201d and \u201cgourmet butter\u201d from France. Mass hysteria ensued. Few stores could keep them in stock and those that did rationed one bag to a customer. The snack\u2019s social media presence was Kardashian-esque. On eBay,\n            \n             two bags of the chips sold\n            \n            for more than $100. An anxious nation was soothed to learn that Haitai is building a chip factory outside Seoul, and disappointed to hear that it will not be completed until next year.\n           \n\n            Frustration was mounting in the East Village as well, where Oiji\u2019s two chefs, Brian Kim and Tae Kyung Ku, wanted to pay homage to honey butter chips, but couldn\u2019t get their hands on any. Undaunted, they took to the kitchen. The chips they came up with have not ignited a citywide panic, but they are not a joke. They come to the table straight from the fryer, translucently thin and shimmering all over with honey and brown sugar melted into butter. Cayenne keeps the syrup from overstaying its welcome. They are crisper and more lovable than wet potato chips have any right to be.\n           \n\n            The chefs grew up in South Korea in the innocent times before honey butter chips. They met in culinary school in the United States, then went off to learn their trade \u2014 Mr. Kim worked at\n            \n             Bouley\n            \n            , and Mr. Ku at\n            \n             Gramercy Tavern\n            \n            and at his family\u2019s restaurant back home. Getting back together years later, they leased a room with a lineage, the former site of Dok Suni, the pioneering modern Korean restaurant on First Avenue. Made over as Oiji, it is a warm and orderly space of exposed brick and wood. Half the dining room is taken up by a table that looks as if it came from the reading room of a college library, with benches on either side.\n           \n\n            Oiji helps take the sting out of Dok Suni\u2019s demise. In some ways it continues its predecessor\u2019s mission of updating and translating Korean cuisine with respect. It may also remind you of the chef Hooni Kim\u2019s places,\n            \n             Danji\n            \n            and\n            \n             Hanjan\n            \n            ; like them, it adjusts traditional recipes for the small-plates era. Those places draw harder on Korea\u2019s more intense flavors, while Oiji aims for a little French-style nuance.\n           \n\n            I promised you buttered rice and beef. Oiji\u2019s braised beef is a variant on a classic banchan, but its version is less salty and soy drenched. You take your wooden spoon and stir it into the rice with half a soft-cooked egg and some low-key radish pickles. The mixture is so subtle it barely registers until the butter\u2019s tractor beam switches on and you find yourself thinking that you could eat this every night.\n           \n\n            The mackerel that Mr. Kim and Mr. Ku smoke over pine needles may fit into your Sunday mornings. It\u2019s soft, a bit creamy, and tastes like something\n            \n             Barney Greengrass\n            \n            might sell if it relocated to a forest in Maine. The fish comes with a soy-based sauce. You\u2019re supposed to brush this on using a cluster of pine needles tied with a string. I liked the mackerel very much but this tiny broom made me feel as if I were having dinner under the floorboards with\n            \n             the Borrowers\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            As for the chicken, it\u2019s a genuine achievement. Typically Korean fried chicken has a hard, crackling shell, but Oiji\u2019s is dressed in a puffy, pale, blistered cloak that crunches like newly fried chicharrones. At the other end of the texture spectrum is the superb terrine of pigs\u2019 feet, firm pink meat held in a thin lattice of gelatin. The terrine is underpinned by French aromatics (thyme, maybe allspice). Korea enters the picture through the precise, clear flavors of the spicy citrus vinaigrette.\n           \n\n            Mr. Kim and Mr. Ku have a spin on yuk hwe, but in their kitchen the chilled raw cubes of beef with egg yolk and sesame oil are augmented by pickled mustard seeds. It\u2019s very good, although cooking the yolk to a soft jelly seemed like an unnecessary flourish.\n           \n\n            A hot soup of ground perilla seeds is gloopy and grainy in a way that some guests at my table never got used to. I wouldn\u2019t put it at the top of my list, but I liked the way the chefs used oyster mushrooms to deepen the flavor of the seeds, which can taste a little flat on their own.\n           \n\n            The risk with this kind of cooking is that people who know their way around traditional Korean restaurants, where the only small plates are the free banchan, may walk away feeling they\u2019ve paid more for less. I didn\u2019t get as much of the tender squid, shrimp and mussels in truffled seafood broth as I wanted. And if the gochujang-braised drumsticks were twice as spicy I doubt shrieks of pain would fill the dining room. But most of the time, when I knew the Korean original, it helped me enjoy the renovations Mr. Kim and Mr. Ku have made.\n           \n\n            The cocktails aren\u2019t quite as clunky as names like Thyme to Samba suggest. Wines are respectable, but the most rewarding thing to drink is soju. Oiji offers more styles and prices than you usually see in one place, including a garnet-colored soju made backstage with pomegranate vinegar.\n           \n\n            All but two dishes are under $20. Most can be shared by two or three people, but if you make a solo dinner of the mackerel for $14 and the house-made cold soba with pickled ramps for $10, you\u2019ll be eating and spending well. Another $5 will get you honey butter chips and the satisfaction of finding a bargain not available on eBay.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 78, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/19/dining/restaurant-review-oiji-in-the-east-village.html", "google_mag": 22.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n            If you can get past the name, a graduate-school groaner that I am supposed to underline, but won\u2019t, there is nothing pretentious about Untitled.\n           \n\n\n             Untitled\n            \n            is on the ground floor of the Whitney Museum of American Art. The Whitney is the second major art museum in the city to choose Danny Meyer to run a big, semiformal restaurant \u2014 the Museum of Modern Art is the other \u2014 and yet Mr. Meyer is resolutely uninterested in arty food. When\n            \n             Eleven Madison Park\n            \n            began its swerve toward the conceptual, he sold it. The remaining holdings in his Union Square Hospitality Group are polite restaurants where polite people are in very little danger of being challenged or provoked. Although Mr. Meyer has worked to make his name synonymous with hospitality, what his restaurants sell above all is reassurance.\n           \n\n            Imagine his relief that the Whitney decided against installing\n            \n             Charles Ray\u2019s sculpture of a naked Huck Finn\n            \n            , bending over next to an 8-foot full-frontal Jim, on the plaza in front of Untitled. (Next door at Santina, which plays Nicki Minaj to Untitled\u2019s Taylor Swift, they would have rearranged the tables for better views.)\n           \n\n            The restaurant is slotted into a narrow quadrangle with glass curtain walls on three sides, designed, like the rest of the museum, by Renzo Piano. Untitled treats the architect deferentially. Too deferentially, I think: In its near-total lack of ornament, the dining room can look like an espresso shop. If Eero Saarinen\u2019s cardinal-red chairs weren\u2019t so comfortable, you might get antsy after an hour. An architect friend spent the night admiring Mr. Piano\u2019s meticulous engineering, but also pointed out that interiors with curtain walls are only as beautiful as the building across the street. At Untitled, you look at a hulking industrial slab across Gansevoort Street. At least it is an improvement on the view from my old desk at Mr. Piano\u2019s New York Times building, where I peered into the dark soul of the Port Authority Bus Terminal.\n           \n\n            All the energy and beauty at Untitled are on the plates. They throb with color. It\u2019s not just decoration, either. The color mostly comes from fruits and vegetables so ripe they\u2019re ready to pop. Michael Anthony, the chef; Suzanne Cupps, the chef de cuisine; and Miro Uskokovic, the pastry chef, use market produce flamboyantly, as though they were trying to get the purse-lipped farm-to-table puritans who solemnly hand you a single baby zucchini to crack a smile.\n           \n\n            A slice of the tender, rich poundcake is virtually swallowed up by ricotta, sabayon, strawberries and violas. More strawberries \u2014 and nearly every other berry under the summer sun \u2014 ring the gloriously slouching chamomile panna cotta in a great purple landslide. Around a towering ship\u2019s-prow wedge of cake with sesame brittle and peanut-butter icing, servers pour a blueberry sauce with the spicy buzz of ginger, which rockets the dessert right out of PB&J territory.\n           \n\n            The four menu categories aren\u2019t labeled, but it\u2019s obvious that the third section is turned over to vegetables. A few are best as side dishes, like the spoonable potato pur\u00e9e liquefied with melted Cheddar, too salty for more than a few bites. Most of the vegetables, though, have enough contrast and sophistication to be appetizers or even main courses.\n           \n\n            Pickled wine-colored cherries, sunflower seeds and orange splashes of carrot vinaigrette make every bite of a kale-and-cabbage salad taste like a new dish. (If we are sentenced to see raw kale everywhere we go, every restaurant should dress it as exuberantly as Untitled does.) Earlier this summer, there were roasted and griddled leeks, as dark as roasted Japanese eggplants and almost that soft, with an intense, sweet-sour salsa sauce of citrus and pasilla chiles; I\u2019ve never wanted to cheer for a plate of leeks before.\n           \n\n            Every taste tells you how carefully (and recently) these chefs have done their shopping. A dinner companion was convinced that some ingredient had been injected into the flat beans to make them taste so alluring, and she didn\u2019t think it had anything to do with the baby squid, hazelnuts and ancho chile sauce on the plate. But no, these were just excellent beans, grilled quickly so they still had some snap and juice.\n           \n\n            You can tell that the rotisserie chicken had great flavor down to its core before it took its turn on the spit. If you\u2019re not sure, try the fried chicken that comes on the same plate. Under the airy, crackling crust that owes something to Japan and Korea, there\u2019s very fine meat.\n           \n\n            If every dish were this good, Untitled might rank up there with Gramercy Tavern, where Mr. Anthony and Mr. Uskokovic hold the same titles they do here. But the kitchen isn\u2019t there yet.\n           \n\n            One night I\u2019d brought along a native of Owensboro, Ky., the smoked mutton capital of the world. But it didn\u2019t take a barbecue authority to know the smoked pork ribs were tough and undercooked, and coated in a paste that didn\u2019t taste of anything but salt.\n           \n\n            It was the only real disaster. In other dishes, the worst you could say is that the cooks packed too much into their shopping bags. The flavor of swordfish steaks disappears into a mashed eggplant that was a little too sharp and salty, and the taste of sea scallops can\u2019t hold its head up in a bowl of sweet watermelon gazpacho with lemon cucumbers and peaches. At times the plates had so much going on that they left you with only a blurry impression of deliciousness. But as blurry impressions go, that one is hard to beat.\n           \n\n            At the end of one dinner, Mr. Anthony stopped by my table. (I\u2019d been spotted long ago.) He was enthusiastic about how the gray limestone floors and white-oak counter catch the light during the day. He was slightly less enthusiastic about the kitchen, which is as narrow as a scallion. When he said he and Ms. Cupps were taking inspiration from the overflowing planters up on the High Line, I understood the botanical profusion of their plates.\n           \n\n            Maybe the wine director, Eduardo Porto Carreiro, can find some inspiration up there, too. Native plants grow on the High Line, and American art fills the Whitney, but Untitled\u2019s wine list genuflects toward Europe. You can drink very well without spending a fortune, but it could get interesting if Mr. Porto Carreiro took his cues from the location.\n           \n\n            Untitled is not really meant for museum visitors, who are much more likely to recuperate with an avocado toast at Mr. Meyer\u2019s Studio Cafe on the eighth floor. Instead, the restaurant is one of the attractions the museum is peddling, part of its multipronged campaign to be seen as a neighborhood hot spot and not just some boring shed where there\u2019s nothing to do but look at art.\n           \n\n            Sometimes I miss those boring sheds, though I don\u2019t miss the school lunchroom smell of their cafeterias. And at least the Whitney\u2019s urge to pump itself up with crowds has given us Untitled.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 79, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/05/dining/restaurant-review-untitled-at-the-whitney-in-the-meatpacking-district.html", "google_mag": 22.399999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n\n             Bruno\n            \n            has a few problems. It\u2019s only been open since July, so maybe it will work them out eventually. I hope so. I don\u2019t want to convict the restaurant\u2019s chefs and owner for these problems because the real killer, as O. J. Simpson would say, is other people.\n           \n\n            More accurately, it\u2019s a small group of people like me whose approval can lift some restaurants from the teeming primordial swamp of contenders, and whose premature praise and willingness to play down discomfort and inconvenience enable problems like Bruno\u2019s.\n           \n\n            These enablers have given the unusual, original pizzas and visually arresting appetizers at Bruno more media attention than you may expect for a fledgling East Village pizzeria whose chefs have never run a full restaurant kitchen. In the middle of September, New York magazine\u2019s website\n            \n             ran an article\n            \n            claiming that Bruno\u2019s $18 plate of bread and fermented mozzarella \u201cmight just be the city\u2019s most impressive new bread course.\u201d\n           \n\n            This was a scoop; nobody else had written about the bread. It may well be that nobody else had tasted the bread, either. It wasn\u2019t on the menu then. An infrequent special, it wasn\u2019t on the menu the last time I ate there, about a week ago.\n           \n\n            Rave reviews of items that have yet to be sold to a paying customer are less rare than you may think. A restaurant that hopes to get a respectable P.R. push out of the gate will often make a few of its more striking dishes available for advance photographs and tastings. As soon as the doors open, waves of impressions from bloggers, Yelpers, Instagrammers and others begin to pound the shoreline. Two critics from Eater were among the earliest customers of David Chang\u2019s Fuku, and their \u201cfirst reactions\u201d\n            \n             were posted\n            \n            about three hours after the first chicken sandwich was sold.\n           \n\n            There are reasons, though, for paid critics to give a new place like Bruno time to settle in.\n           \n\n            Pizza is not as simple as it appears. Getting it right takes time. Bruno\u2019s chefs, Justin Slojkowski and Dave Gulino, mill the flour in the basement from whole New York State wheat berries, and ferment it slowly with a sourdough starter. I don\u2019t know another local pizzeria that goes to these lengths, and you won\u2019t taste a crust like Bruno\u2019s anywhere else. What the raised perimeter lacks in crunch it makes up for in earthy, whole-grain flavor. But the crust has been slightly different each time I\u2019ve tried it. Most recently, it had a uniform fluffiness, a cushiony yet chewy softness, without big air pockets or blisters.\n           \n\n            When it comes to toppings, Mr. Slojkowski and Mr. Gulino don\u2019t play it safe, either. Their nearest approach to a classic pie is their margherita, with a sauce that incorporates sweet, juicy garlic and some fermented tomatoes. These give it a fizzy tang along with a slight saltiness. It takes some getting used to, but it interacts energetically with the white slicks of dense, rich mozzarella.\n           \n\n            Other pies verged on baked salads, with varying degrees of success. The most satisfying was the one with shavings of country ham and sliced peaches punctuated by melted blots of soft, grassy cheese made from raw cow\u2019s milk.\n           \n\n            The most confounding started with a base of ricotta, thin rounds of zucchini and a carrot-top pesto that reminded me distantly of za\u2019atar. A mound of raw, crunchy, long-stemmed greens interwoven with bottarga shavings was heaped on top. I studied this foliage for a way in. I tried biting a slice and munched like a cow, while leaves and stems flapped from my lips. I tried eating the greens with a fork. I couldn\u2019t escape the feeling that I had been served at least two different dishes at once.\n           \n\n            The appetizers were more perplexing. As a lot, they looked more interesting than they were. Seared scallops got almost no assistance from a bright orange raw-carrot sauce. It didn\u2019t have the sweetness of cooked carrots, which might have underlined the shellfish\u2019s own sweetness. Maybe the chefs just like the color. This seemed to be the case with a salad of pink watermelon with green needles of okra. The flavors stayed stubbornly separate, the okra contributing only its interior sliminess. Inexplicably, the chefs also spurted a gray dribble of soaked basil seeds on the plate. It was a real goo party.\n           \n\n            Then there was the squid, nested above roasted Hatch chiles inside little cups of charred onion. Nothing blended. The undercooked onions were too crunchy, the peppers too dominant.\n           \n\n            The squid cups looked cool, though, which seemed to be the whole point of this and other dishes. Bruno is one of many new places where building flavor seems less important than composing an image that can rocket straight to the digital billboards. It\u2019s hard to explain how great something tastes, but easy to show how great it looks, and in the short run, contemporary food media rewards the latter.\n           \n\n            Uncomfortable restaurant seats have become an accepted signifier of edgy seriousness. Seating at Bruno is divided into a long row of tables with chairs and banquettes, and a counter where you sit on upended whitewashed crates that offer no footrest or back support. After squirming on one of these, I knew why prisoners forced to kneel for hours will confess to anything.\n           \n\n            \u201cThe dishes will come out as they\u2019re ready,\u201d our server on another night had said, which sounded like a good thing: lots of food at once! But what he had meant was that it would trickle out slowly, one plate at a time deposited in the middle of the table.\n           \n\n            One of my companions wanted only her pasta, sitting out the other dishes. It came out last, after a 15-minute pause, only it wasn\u2019t what she had ordered. There was another long wait for the right dish to show up. I\u2019ve put up with this style of service in other restaurants, but the absurdity of it finally hit me here because this was supposed to be a pizzeria.\n           \n\n            Mr. Slojkowski and Mr. Gulino first came to attention serving tasting menus by night inside an East Village coffee shop. What the critics who lavish praise on tasting menus, including me, never tell you is that it is one of the easiest ways to run a kitchen. Serving a full restaurant where everybody orders different things at different times is much, much trickier. It takes speed and organizational skills that seemed to elude the chefs at Bruno on this night.\n           \n\n            No doubt this will come with practice. The chefs may eventually prepare plates that taste as interesting as they look. They might start by eating their own cooking blindfolded. The rest of us, the critics and bloggers and Yelpers, might try the reverse. Maybe it\u2019s time to take off our blindfolds.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 80, "rating": "Satisfactory", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/21/dining/restaurant-review-bruno-east-village.html", "google_mag": 30.5}, {"review_text": "\n            Standing on a drawbridge one night early this month, a man and a woman stood close and kissed, blind to everything around them, even the motionless toxic porridge of the Gowanus Canal below their feet. About to cross the span, I stopped to give them their space. The Union Street Bridge in Brooklyn is not the Pont Marie in Paris. But romance can bloom anywhere, even on a Superfund site.\n           \n\n            Around the corner on Nevins Street, I\u2019d just had an unusually enjoyable dinner at a restaurant that has been busy constructing its own Gowanus romance. Called\n            \n             Freek\u2019s Mill\n            \n            , it is named after a pre-Revolutionary War gristmill powered by a race that emptied into the Gowanus, when it was still a creek.\n           \n\n            \u201cThe name Freek\u2019s Mill references a time when people in the area not only knew where their food came from, but also where it was processed,\u201d the restaurant\u2019s website explains, adding, \u201cThe food we serve, clearly not from the canal or its long gone farms, comes wherever possible from the growers we know and love, who cultivate food based on taste and sustainable cultivation practices.\u201d\n           \n\n            Scratch this story with your fingernail, and you quickly uncover a highly idealized view of the past. A century before Freek built his mill, Dutch colonists forced African-born slaves to turn the Gowanus marshes into farmland and dig the first millponds. The white settlers were lured by the Dutch West India Company, whose ships moved ingredients and other goods around the globe. It seems unlikely that most 18th-century grocery shoppers knew precisely where their cinnamon came from or where their molasses was processed.\n           \n\n            Fables of agrarian life are hardly unique to Freek\u2019s Mill. They help form the narrative of the farm-to-table movement. In this case, they are also being used to recast the image of a neighborhood best known for pollution that makes the Flint River look like an Adirondack stream.\n           \n\n            Like most marketing, this should not be taken too seriously. Freek\u2019s Mill is hardly a return to preindustrial living. But after two months in business, it is already a swell place to spend a night in a postindustrial zone where gentrification has moved as slowly as the fluid in the canal.\n           \n\n            There are smiles at the door on the corner, whether you walk in with or without a reservation. Servers wear gingham shirts, standard attire in restaurants broadcasting their affection for farms.\n           \n\n            Windows on two walls let the early-evening light into a spartan dining room with wide floorboards and a cheery bar. In the back are more tables across from a kitchen counter that faces a domed oven, a wood fire burning inside. Freek\u2019s Mill, in short, looks not very different from other young, ingredient-minded Brooklyn restaurants from Greenpoint to Park Slope.\n           \n\n            But there is a little more air between the tables than usual. And there\u2019s a little less attitude among the servers, even when they hit you with the news that nearly every white wine is a chenin blanc and that gamay is involved in almost all the reds. They\u2019re cheerful about saying this, as they should be. Alex Alan, one of the owners,\n            \n             built the list\n            \n            to show how much range these grapes have. The wines are also flexible, wrapping themselves around whatever you happen to be eating.\n           \n\n            This is lucky, because so many things on Chad Shaner\u2019s menu are worth trying.\n           \n\n            With half-grown chefs around the country getting attention for the two weeks they spent fondling beets at\n            \n             Noma\n            \n            , it\u2019s something of a relief to learn that the highlights of Mr. Shaner\u2019s career were jobs at\n            \n             Union Square Cafe\n            \n            and\n            \n             BLT Prime\n            \n            . Neither place has been in the vanguard of culinary innovation recently, but somewhere along the line, Mr. Shaner learned to cook food that really tastes good.\n           \n\n            The more you eat of his striped bass ceviche, the more interesting it becomes, as green chiles and tart, unripe strawberries meet the softening influence of basil cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.\n           \n\n            Mr. Shaner had the smart idea of turning veal Oscar sideways; asparagus, the traditional garnish, goes to the center of the plate. The crab meat and hollandaise go on top, with a sprinkle of Old Bay seasoning. The veal? There isn\u2019t any, and you don\u2019t miss it at all.\n           \n\n            The goal with fried soft-shell crabs is usually a delicate crust. Freek\u2019s Mill goes the other way, giving it a very crunchy, thickish batter that you sometimes see on the fish half of fish and chips. You\u2019d expect to find citrus in this dish, and you do, but it\u2019s a cool surprise to taste lime juice mixed into the cashew butter swiped against the side of the bowl.\n           \n\n            I never met any bad dishes at Freek\u2019s Mill, and only a few I wouldn\u2019t try again. Chicken livers in a dandelion salad dotted with hard-cooked egg crumbs were cooked until they were dark and chewy. There\u2019s precedent for this style, but I wished they\u2019d been creamier. And barbecued kohlrabi served over grits just made me think about all the other things that could be barbecued and served over grits.\n           \n\n            We are, you won\u2019t be surprised to learn, in the realm of small plates. Value can be hard to assess in this genre, and at Freek\u2019s Mill, it is more complicated because service is built into the prices. (This is a no-tipping restaurant.) A big, smoky hunk of fat-streaked pork jowl with pickled vegetables and mustard sauce was a relative bargain at $19. For four rosy slices of dry-aged duck over a hard-to-resist mash of refried cranberry beans sweetened with rosemary honey, $24 didn\u2019t seem out of line.\n           \n\n            But $25 was pushing it for three seared scallops with roasted lemon and asparagus, even if the scallops are strikingly fresh and sweet. And for $20, you may hope for more than a single short length of blackened octopus leg with potatoes and a chorizo vinaigrette.\n           \n\n            With dessert, the choices narrow. A slice of bread pudding in rhubarb syrup was just too wet, and an ice cream sandwich that\u2019s meant to be a homage to Thin Mints, the Girl Scout cookies, wasn\u2019t as much fun as it could have been. I suggest the strawberry clafoutis drowned under fresh cream that bubbles when it hits the iron baking dish.\n           \n\n            After dinner one night, I was standing across the street from Freek\u2019s Mill reading emails when a bright light blinded me. \u201cDo you live around here?\u201d the driver of the police car demanded.\n           \n\n            \u201cAm I doing something wrong?\u201d\n           \n\n            \u201cWell, you\u2019re standing by yourself in a desolate area,\u201d he said.\n           \n\n            Desolate?

This is almost certainly because for a long time, very few people outside certain neighborhoods in Nashville knew what hot chicken was.\n           \n\n            The ones who did know usually lived somewhere near Prince\u2019s Hot Chicken Shack, which was known as Prince\u2019s BBQ Chicken Shack until it was taken over by a member of the family who thought it was time to acknowledge that what the Princes did to chicken had nothing to do with barbecue. Prince\u2019s is and always was a fried-chicken restaurant.\n           \n\n            The chicken was never cooked in advance. It spattered away in a skillet while the customer who had ordered it waited, and waited. But the thing that made Prince\u2019s famous, to the extent that it was famous, was what happened to the chicken after it came out of the skillet. Still dripping with oil, the legs, thighs and breasts were given a glossy finish with spicy oil.\n           \n\n            Prince\u2019s kitchen is a restricted area. The family guards the recipe for that oil fiercely. But the seasonings are said to include brown sugar, dried garlic, paprika and, crucially, cayenne.\n           \n\n            Depending on how much oil is applied, the cayenne can make a hot-chicken eater cry. When Anthony Bourdain was asked about the scariest situations he\u2019d been in while filming his television shows, he named Congo, Libya and Beirut, followed by hot chicken in Nashville.\n           \n\n            Pain was the point all along. According to the family legend, which fortunately for everybody took shape long before fact-checking became a household phrase in America, Thornton Prince\u2019s girlfriend cooked the first hot chicken for breakfast one morning during the Depression to get back at him for his nocturnal wanderings. Forgetting that revenge is best served cold, she loaded the chicken with spice, only to find that her unfaithful man loved hot chicken, shared hot chicken with his friends and made hot chicken into a business that has lasted more than 70 years.\n           \n\n            Although Prince\u2019s had local competition from a hot chicken place started by a former cook, it was only in this decade that entrepreneurs began to think that cooking chicken that makes customers cry might be a good way to earn money.\n           \n\n            In the Nashville area there is Slow Burn,\n            \n             Pepperfire\n            \n            and\n            \n             Hattie B\u2019s\n            \n            , among others. KFC began selling\n            \n             its version of Nashville hot chicken\n            \n            throughout the United States in January. Independent operators have set up across the country from\n            \n             Los Angeles\n            \n            to\n            \n             Cambridge, Mass.\n            \n            , to Brooklyn, where Carla Hall opened a tiny Nashville chicken spot in June.\n           \n\n\n             Carla Hall\u2019s Southern Kitchen\n            \n            doesn\u2019t lack for branding. Slogans and catchphrases are written all over the menu and the walls, inside and outside on the corner of Kane and Columbia Streets. The place is so clearly positioned to spawn multiple locations that it almost seems pregnant.\n           \n\n            When you have decided whether you want thighs, drumsticks, breasts, tenders or some combination of these, one of the smiling people working at the counter will ask: \u201cDo you want Southern, Hoot & Honey, Hoot, Hootie Hoot, Hoot-N-Nannie, or Boomshakalaka?\u201d\n           \n\n            It\u2019s like having a conversation with an owl. Even when you know that Ms. Hall, a host on \u201cThe Chew,\u201d has been identified with the phrase \u201chootie hoo\u201d since her days as a \u201cTop Chef\u201d contestant, this is not an easy question to answer the first time you hear it, or the second or third time, either.\n           \n\n            Most customers fall back on a number system, one to six. Level one, Southern, gets no hot oil and is easy enough to eat. Like all the chicken, it sits on white bread and has pickle slices pinned on it with toothpicks. Level two is slicked all over with just enough oil to give it a rounder flavor that is sweet, savory and spicy but not cruel.\n           \n\n            Heat tolerance is of course a personal thing, but at level three I became slightly more aware of my skin; at level four, I became conscious of the passing of time; at level five, I began tearing off chunks of white bread and stuffing them into my mouth. Level six gave me second thoughts, but not serious pain.\n           \n\n            (If you want to go to the dark side, the chicken for you is the extra hot at\n            \n             Peaches HotHouse\n            \n            in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, although the chile payload is delivered by a spice powder sprinkled over the top; parts of the crust that aren\u2019t powdered just taste like regular fried chicken.)\n           \n\n            The meat at Carla Hall\u2019s Southern Kitchen tastes natural, which is to say it hasn\u2019t been twisted beyond recognition by aggressive brining of the kind practiced at\n            \n             Root & Bone\n            \n            and other places around town. Ms. Hall seems to have focused her efforts on the crust, and it is excellent, a darkish shell both formidably crunchy and a little chewy. Spice or no spice, this is not a style of fried chicken you often find in New York.\n           \n\n            The hottest and crunchiest chicken I ate was the one I waited longest for. The least exciting, though it was still well worth eating, was a piece of white meat that came out before I\u2019d moved from a counter to one of the few chairs. This is a small restaurant, not built for lounging, and Ms. Hall may not want hungry crowds hanging out while the chicken sizzles away. But her recipe is good enough to make you wish every piece were cooked to order.\n           \n\n            The sides and desserts will not draw anybody to Columbia Street, but a few of them are very good.\n           \n\n            I tend to sigh when I hear that collards were cooked without meat, but Ms. Hall\u2019s are lively and tangy; better, actually, than many pots of collards around town. No reforms have been inflicted on the candied yams, and that is good news.\n           \n\n            The pimento cheese, punched up with flecks of hot green pepper and served with a waxed-paper bag of Ritz crackers, was exactly what I hoped it would be. I felt the same way about the biscuits, which had a tenderness that tends to elude Northern cooks.\n           \n\n            The potato salad, on the other hand, needed perking up, and the macaroni and cheese was the opposite of creamy, a hard, bland lattice of noodles. The bread pudding was dried out, too, and something seemed to have gone wrong with the whoopie pies. They were dense and lumpy, as if a distracted baker had left out an ingredient.\n           \n\n            I can\u2019t imagine why Ms. Hall is bothering with whoopie pies when her banana pudding is (a) charming, with caramelized bananas and a swirl of what looks like whipped cream but turns out to be a version of Marshmallow Fluff; and (b) the only dessert anybody needs after pimento cheese and fried chicken.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 82, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/dining/carla-hall-southern-kitchen-review.html", "google_mag": 22.700000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n            \u201cThis is the first place you\u2019ve taken me where I\u2019d come back and spend my own money,\u201d a friend said in the middle of lunch at\n            \n             Pondicheri\n            \n            . He is highly sensitive to pretension and unjustified expense, so whenever I take him along on one of my hunting parties, I try to pick something with a high ratio of flavor to price. At Pondicheri, I finally hit his sweet spot.\n           \n\n            By that time, I was sure I\u2019d be back, too. The chef and owner, Anita Jaisinghani, chose New York as the first site of a string of all-day Indian cafes she hopes to open around the country, modeled on her\n            \n             original Pondicheri in Houston\n            \n            . She also has a more formal Indian restaurant there called\n            \n             Indika\n            \n            , but if she brought that to Manhattan, she would have to compete with such restaurants as\n            \n             Paowalla\n            \n            ,\n            \n             Tamarind Tribeca\n            \n            and\n            \n             Indian Accent\n            \n            . There isn\u2019t anything in the city quite like Pondicheri.\n           \n\n            A few blocks north of the Flatiron Building, it inhabits a space so cavernous that maps may be useful. (It wasn\u2019t until my fourth meal that I discovered a corner table hidden behind a wall all the way in the back of the restaurant.) The sheer number of seats is one of the things that makes it worth keeping in mind, because Pondicheri would work for so many occasions.\n           \n\n            When I wanted to have breakfast alone, I\u2019d go to the front counter and ask for a cup of masala chai. Pondicheri makes it smooth and strong, with more than a whisper of spice. Then I\u2019d find a table where I could eat the wonderful aloo paratha with my hands, loving the way the crisp shell collided with the soft potatoes inside, feeling the mustard oil rake the back of my throat, licking the ghee from my fingers. Or I might get the masala eggs, firmly scrambled with fennel, onions, peppers and spices, and then spread out over a wedge of spiced carrot paratha.\n           \n\n            For a morning meeting with people who\u2019d never seen me lick ghee off my fingers, I\u2019d probably point to a few things behind the glass pastry cases \u2014 whatever looked good that day. I\u2019d hope for a return of the fig cake I had last week, essentially fig preserves baked into a muffin top.\n           \n\n            And I\u2019d keep an eye out for the honey mesquite cake, which is delicate with almond and mesquite flour, savory with ginger and other warm spices. Honey has been spritzed around, but the cake hasn\u2019t been drenched in it. It\u2019s a delicious example of Ms. Jaisinghani\u2019s strategy of importing Indian flavors into American daily life.\n           \n\n            The best time to take Pondicheri\u2019s full measure is between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m., when servers at the counter will take orders for either breakfast or lunch. Beet uttapam is technically a breakfast dish here. But this spongy, slightly tangy pancake topped with a fried egg makes a perfect lunch; it is served on a thali platter next to little metal cups holding a nice crunchy salad, some cilantro chutney and a turmeric soup that tastes as if it held the secret of eternal health. In the nonvegetarian version, another cup carries a small crumbly heap of lamb keema, very tasty stuff.\n           \n\n            There are roti wraps called frankies, as well as salads and curries, like the chicken stewed in a tomato-tinged curry of unusual complexity. It\u2019s named Chicken 25 after the number of seasonings in the curry, and it is worth asking for even though it sounds like a genetic engineering experiment. I liked this much more than the sayel lamb kofta, meatballs in a nondescript meat sauce.\n           \n\n            The snacks and side dishes that become available after 11 a.m. are exciting, too. I can\u2019t remember a meat samosa that I liked better than the ones that Pondicheri fills with lentils and goat braised in spices. Papdi chaat, a plate of semolina crackers and lentil dumplings buried under yogurt and chutney, is completely messy and a joy to eat.\n           \n\n            My friend who\u2019s planning to come back to Pondicheri insisted we get the fried okra, one of his benchmarks for Indian kitchens. Crunchy and free of any trace of goo, it passed his test. And I love Pondicheri\u2019s \u201cdesi fries,\u201d which start with curly fries (a very good place to start, as Maria von Trapp would say) that are blasted with an irresistible spice mix.\n           \n\n            After lunch, I stopped at the bakery counter, where the morning pastries had been replaced by cookies (there\u2019s a great spiced chocolate chip and a puffy ginger cookie with a scalloped edge that makes it look like a paw) and appealing lemon bars that take their flavor more from the aromatic peel than from the sour juice.\n           \n\n            Raised in India, Ms. Jaisinghani earned a degree in microbiology, with the idea that she would eventually work as a pathologist. Her career was held up while she had two children. (Her daughter, Ajna Jai, now manages her New York City restaurant.) When she was ready to work again, she didn\u2019t send her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to a laboratory but to one of the best restaurants in Houston. The two years she spent learning about flour, sugar and eggs in the pastry kitchen at\n            \n             Cafe Annie\n            \n            must account for the skill and creativity of Pondicheri\u2019s bakery.\n           \n\n            If you go for dinner, the menu changes shape again. The food is a little dressier, is ordered at the table and falls more neatly into appetizers and main courses.\n           \n\n            My dinner started very well with tangy, tamarind-marinated quail, with a pine-nut stuffing tucked into the breast. Some lamb skewers were disappointingly dry, but I was wild about a version of saag paneer made with mustard greens; as soon as I tasted it, I knew I was going to crave the sharper, more assertive flavor the next time I had saag paneer made with spinach.\n           \n\n            The impressive size of Pondicheri may be an advantage at lunch, because it virtually guarantees that you will find a seat. At dinner, though, it works against the place. The crowds so far haven\u2019t been big or energetic enough to fill the room, and even the long bar doesn\u2019t do much to turn up the voltage.\n           \n\n            The staff can be a bit desultory, too, although I found this more charming than off-putting. (I loved the deadpan way our server said, describing the crudit\u00e9s appetizer, \u201cAll the vegetables come from the Greenmarket, if that\u2019s of any interest.\u201d)\n           \n\n            Pondicheri is not the place to take a crowd of people who want dinner to be the show. But that\u2019s fine. It doesn\u2019t need to do absolutely everything a restaurant can do when it already does several things so well.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 83, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/dining/pondicheri-restaurant-review.html", "google_mag": 27.200000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n            You enter Tom Colicchio\u2019s new restaurant near City Hall through what is suddenly the most stunning hotel lobby bar in New York City.\n            \n             The Beekman hotel\n            \n            \u2019s bar is at the bottom of the atrium of the 1883 Temple Court Building, which rises up through seven floors of elaborate cast-iron railings to end in a soaring glass pyramid. It\u2019s a striking room where you can sink into an armchair with a solidly built drink in your hand and get lost in the past, a quintessentially urban experience that most of the city\u2019s grand old hotels no longer give us.\n           \n\n            With\n            \n             Fowler & Wells\n            \n            , Mr. Colicchio tries to extend the atrium\u2019s Gilded Age exuberance. He never quite gets there. The problem isn\u2019t quality or effort: The cooking is spotlessly correct, the ingredients shimmer on the plate, the flavors all make sense, and the dining room is dignified in a way that makes you realize how undervalued that trait has become in restaurants. But the central vision tying it all together is fuzzy. The restaurant is somehow less than the sum of its parts.\n           \n\n            Choosing the $135 tasting menu one night, I got a seven-course tour of robber-baron dishes as interpreted by Mr. Colicchio and Bryan Hunt, the executive chef. The opener was a delicious variation on the theme of oysters Rockefeller. Watercress stood in for spinach, and the chubby Belon oyster had been poached in oyster liquor and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche seasoned with fennel and bacon: all the right flavors, rearranged.\n           \n\n            Duck \u00e0 l\u2019orange was reworked, wonderfully, with kumquats. I smiled at how smart the chefs were to add a rippling charge to the sweetened citrus with ginger, mustard seed and vinegar made from oranges.\n           \n\n            The meat of little lobsters had been chopped and replaced in the shells with a green slash of tomalley, tarragon leaves and chanterelles the size of shirt buttons. It was very good, but was the sort of dish that chefs of Mr. Colicchio\u2019s generation have been cooking for a couple of decades. With the possible exception of its superb pastry crust, the same was true of venison Wellington, with chestnuts and black trumpets inside a ring of huckleberry sauce.\n           \n\n            None of this is a problem in and of itself \u2014 good food is good! \u2014 but you might feel mildly let down if you believed the pre-opening press, which promised cooking inspired by an earlier era. At\n            \n             Le Coucou\n            \n            , Daniel Rose locates the energy in old-guard French dishes and then multiplies it, but the kitchen at Fowler & Wells often seems to be trying to get away from the past.\n           \n\n            If you order \u00e0 la carte, the historical references are hard to spot. The freedom the chefs take here can lead to some exciting turns of imagination. Pounded rabbit loin was fried into a long, crunchy schnitzel and served over chickpeas and pistachios; lemon confit and lots of thyme leaves snapped the dish into harmony.\n           \n\n            There was a memorable monkfish cooked in hot wood smoke, served with freekeh and other grains cooked in reduced beet juice. The same grains, toasted to a crackle, had been tossed over the top. Warm cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche softened the earthy taste of the beets, although I didn\u2019t see the point of spiking this sauce with caviar.\n           \n\n            The kitchen\u2019s creativity seems to run out of gas at some points, though. There wasn\u2019t a lot of flavor in firm lumps of sweetbread with brussels sprout leaves and pale bands of lardon, and not much surprise in the juxtaposition of roasted salsify, sunchokes and leeks over a pale sunchoke pur\u00e9e. There\u2019s a pretty plate of raw fluke under red-rimmed wheels of radish and tiny globes of finger lime; it was as good as it is in other restaurants where I\u2019ve had nearly the same dish.\n           \n\n            The \u00e0 la carte menu would be more tempting if it overlapped at all with the tasting menu. It wasn\u2019t until my third visit that a server suggested the chef might be able to dislodge some dishes from the tasting menu to serve as an appetizer or main course. The two barely related menus make it hard to figure out what the Fowler & Wells experience is supposed to be.\n           \n\n            The disconnection carries over to the atmosphere. Like the lobby bar (but not the hotel\u2019s other restaurant,\n            \n             Keith McNally\n            \n            \u2019s\n            \n             Augustine\n            \n            ),\n            \n             the dining room interior\n            \n            was done by\n            \n             Martin Brudnizki Design Studio\n            \n            , but seems to have been put together by two different Brudnizkis who may or may not be on speaking terms.\n           \n\n            One Brudnizki went for a turn-of-the-century glint. There are tiered bronze chandeliers and walls overlaid with green and gold plaster until they look as if they belong in the ballroom of some faded Italian palace. In the middle of it all is an immense oval cabinet, with wine bottles on its marble top and stemware on shelves held up by bronze rails that rise into the air like the upper decks of an ocean liner.\n           \n\n            The other Brudnizki commissioned huge grids of backlighted colored glass and brought in mirror tiles and sparkly faceted-glass sconces. The walls belong in \u201cThe Leopard,\u201d but the mirrors and sconces are right out of \u201cThe Sopranos.\u201d\n           \n\n            The name Fowler & Wells is a muddle in its own way. Before the current structure was built, another building stood on the corner of Beekman and Nassau Streets. Among its tenants were\n            \n             Orson Fowler and Samuel Wells\n            \n            , a pair of phrenologists with a sideline in publishing.\n           \n\n            The 19th-century belief that\n            \n             skull shape revealed character\n            \n            provides some amusing, arcane cocktail names. But in its day, phrenology wrapped a gauzy cloak of fake science around\n            \n             the ugly armor of racism\n            \n            . Fowler was close to several abolitionists, but he also\n            \n             wrote that the heads of black people\n            \n            made them \u201cour best nurses\u201d and \u201cexcellent waiters\u201d while dooming them to language skills that were at best \u201cmiddling.\u201d\n           \n\n            This is obviously not a side of phrenology that Mr. Colicchio, who is outspoken about his progressive politics, embraces. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anybody to think we take it seriously, because it was used for some not very good things,\u201d he said in an interview.\n           \n\n            Later, I told him that the dining room staff was noticeably diverse. (One day I hope that will go without saying at restaurants all over the city.) \u201cI\u2019m not involved in hiring front-of-house staff,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got to say, I feel pretty good about it.\u201d\n           \n\n            My service was sometimes jittery, but fast and attentive. A brisk professionalism is at work throughout the restaurant. The wine service and the list, overseen by Jarred Roth, is welcoming whether you have specific tastes or just a general notion of what you like.\n           \n\n            Meals always ended on a high note thanks to the pastry chef, Abby Swain. She has a nimble mind and a sensible palate, a great combination that results in desserts like a baked alaska based on the flavors of Black Forest cake, or the panna cotta with poached quince and maple syrup.\n           \n\n            Fowler & Wells has so many strengths that few people will leave unhappy. But they may wake up the next day with scattered impressions of what the place is about, until Mr. Colicchio and Mr. Hunt can bring more focus to the menu.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 84, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/dining/fowler-and-wells-restaurant-review-beekman-hotel.html", "google_mag": 28.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n            I\u2019ve finally found a new restaurant on the Upper West Side that I want to recommend to people who don\u2019t live there. It has only taken me five years.\n           \n\n            In my time as critic, I\u2019ve searched the streets between Lincoln Center and Columbia University for good places to eat. I\u2019ve come across some, but I could never convince myself that any of them were worth a special trip. That finally changed after October, when Ken Friedman and April Bloomfield opened\n            \n             White Gold Butchers\n            \n            , a restaurant inside a butcher shop on Amsterdam Avenue.\n           \n\n            Here\u2019s something strange: In all this time, I\u2019ve never heard from Upper West Side readers either attacking me for ignoring their neighborhood or tipping me off to a gem I\u2019d overlooked. Have they just given up hope after watching the local restaurants they could honestly tell friends were worth traveling for \u2014 Picholine, Telepan, Ouest \u2014 close one by one?\n           \n\n            Another odd thing: White Gold is the first Bloomfield-Friedman restaurant where I have never had to wait to be seated. True, one night I showed up ridiculously early, and by the time I left, a small crowd by the door was eyeing my table. But people in the neighborhood tell me it is possible more often than not to walk right in and sit down. This is not typically the case at\n            \n             the Spotted Pig\n            \n            ,\n            \n             the Breslin Bar & Dining Room\n            \n            , Salvation Burger or other restaurants run by Ms. Bloomfield and Mr. Friedman.\n           \n\n            Where is everybody? People, April Bloomfield is cooking meat, one of the things she does best.\n           \n\n            Two young butchers, Jocelyn Guest and Erika Nakamura, are partners in the restaurant; in their blue aprons and white shirts, they oversee the carving and trimming and sawing and chopping. Looking at the colors in the glass butcher\u2019s case, the plum purple of the raw pork and the marigold yellow of the chicken skin, you know that this meat will cook up so nicely that it can be eaten and enjoyed all by itself. White Gold doesn\u2019t go quite that far, but it comes close.\n           \n\n            The menu gets right to the point, no small talk: The main courses fall under the heading Plates. There are usually four of them, cooked very simply. A gorgeously juicy and pink length of grilled pork, for example, was flecked with sage salt, and its only garnish was a spoonful of sauce made from apples \u2014 not applesauce but a saltier and more complex reduction.\n           \n\n            Beef heart was served like steak, sliced into small, tender, nearly rare slabs. The spice-and-nut blend dukkah was the seasoning. Probably meant more for the roasted carrots on the same plate, the dukkah was also at home with the heart.\n           \n\n            A special one night was a portion of pork shoulder cooked in milk at a quiet murmur until the meat had relaxed and the liquid had boiled away and the fat had pulled together in sweet curds the color of peanut butter. It sounds and looks creepy, but it\u2019s wonderful.\n           \n\n            As good as it felt to lose myself in tender pork and caramelized milk, the high point of that dinner was beef carpaccio. White Gold now makes my favorite version of this classic Italian dish in New York. The toppings are sliced white mushrooms, parsley leaves and pickled broccoli stems. I\u2019d never given much thought to pickled broccoli stems before, but now I think their highest use is with darkly lush sheets of raw beef furred over with fine white horseradish gratings.\n           \n\n            The raviolo in brodo is Italian, too, up to a point. The broth is beef, deeply brown and sticky on the lips. For the single raviolo, two circles of barely cooked kabocha squash do the work normally done by pasta, sandwiching a creamy core of taleggio that will end up running out and slipping into the broth, no matter how careful you are, flavoring the soup along with red drops of pumpkinseed oil.\n           \n\n            If none of this has persuaded you to take a train or crosstown bus to the Upper West Side, then it\u2019s time to let the \u201ccrispy layered potato\u201d out of its cage.\n           \n\n            These are little golden boxes made of thin rectangles of potato stacked like Post-it notes, then fried in beef fat. I\u2019m not sure how they stay together. They are crunchy and delicate and impossible to stop eating. White Gold has found a way to multiply the surface area of a fairly small piece of potato so that more potato comes into contact with hot oil. This is a significant advance in the field of applied potato physics.\n           \n\n            Like Fleishers Craft Butchery, Dickson\u2019s Farmstand Meats and a few other butcher shops, White Gold buys whole animals. In theory, the cooks should be able to get creative with the odds and ends, yet offal isn\u2019t a major feature of the menu. I have to admit that the White Gold of my dreams would serve not just chicken liver mousse but gizzard confit; not just grilled lamb leg but saut\u00e9ed kidneys; not just pork shoulder but stuffed trotters.\n           \n\n            In the morning, White Gold is devoted to egg sandwiches. At lunch, you can order a version of the chopped cheese, a late-night specialty of bodegas in Harlem and the Bronx. As the sandwich has started showing up in other neighborhoods, at higher prices, it has become a symbol of cultural appropriation and gentrification. White Gold sells it for $11, roughly twice what it would cost on its home turf.\n           \n\n            It is also a somewhat odd interpretation, not so much the classic cheese-slicked heap of ground beef as a cheeseburger hacked into chunks.\n           \n\n            Britain does better than the Bronx on White Gold\u2019s lunch menu. Head straight to the savory-pastry case and get a sausage roll, a stub of golden crust wrapped around pink, coarse breakfast sausages, or a pasty, a hand pie that can be held by its rolled seam, which looks like a fat lip. One pasty is filled with potatoes and fontina; another with beef stew. Both are so good I\u2019d recommend buying an extra to tote around in an empty pocket.\n           \n\n            One reason White Gold isn\u2019t mobbed at night may be that, for the first time, Mr. Friedman and Ms. Bloomfield have built a restaurant without a bar. Wine and beer are available, from Narragansett in a can to (when I was there) a six-year-old bottle of petit verdot from Clendenen Family Vineyards, but there\u2019s nowhere to drink them unless you\u2019re eating.\n           \n\n            The space doesn\u2019t encourage hanging out with a glass. This may have to do with the bright lighting \u2014 butchers need to be able to see to do their work \u2014 or the relative starkness of the atmosphere. The wallpaper in the restroom has more energy than the rest of the interior design put together.\n           \n\n            White Gold reminds me of small, obscure, excellent restaurants I\u2019ve tripped into during vacations, the tapas bar or the trattoria that happened to be close to where I was staying and that I remember better than the places other people had recommended before I left home.\n           \n\n            White Gold may never be a destination, but in its modest and simple way, it\u2019s memorable.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 85, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/dining/white-gold-butchers-review-april-bloomfield-restaurant.html", "google_mag": 24.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n            Like many habits, the pursuit of good sushi can get expensive.

What\u2019s next?\n           \n\n\n             Sugarfish by Sushi Nozawa\n            \n            would like to be the answer. It\u2019s not, but enough people believe it is, or want to believe, that getting inside this four-month-old restaurant on East 20th Street can be a test of patience.\n           \n\n            Sugarfish arrived with an out-of-town pedigree. Its branches around Los Angeles have an ardent following, and one of the chain\u2019s founders,\n            \n             Kazunori Nozawa\n            \n            , was among the first sushi chefs to bring to that city a rigorously autocratic style. Specializing in omakase, he was known to yell at those foolish enough to stir wasabi into their soy sauce.\n           \n\n            Nobody yelled at me at Sugarfish, but the staff didn\u2019t seem all that eager to feed me, either. I made my first assault on the host stand just after 6:30 one weeknight. (The place doesn\u2019t do reservations.) I was alone and willing to wait even if it took until closing time \u2014 11 that night. What an optimist I was in those days. \u201cWe\u2019re not taking any more names tonight,\u201d a host announced.\n           \n\n            Later, I learned to stage my raids between 2 and 4 in the afternoon, not hours when I typically crave raw fish. One lucky day, I was in within 30 minutes and out before sunset.\n           \n\n            One can order sushi by the piece, but the servers and the printed menu heavily push the three \u201cTrust Me\u201d meals. This is a variant on omakase, which roughly means \u201cI trust the chef,\u201d but a Trust Me is not an omakase meal. It is, essentially, a set menu served in waves. All three start with chilled edamame and slices of tuna in ponzu, move on to several small courses of nigiri and end with a hand roll or two. The simplest, Trust Me Lite, is $27 and includes four pieces of nigiri; the most expensive is the Nozawa Trust Me, with 12 pieces of sushi and two hand rolls at a price of $51.\n           \n\n            Each course zooms out of a window in the kitchen where sushi is made with unusual speed. Efficiency lets Sugarfish keep prices low, the volume high and the rice warm \u2014 a hallmark of what the critic Jonathan Gold has termed\n            \n             the School of Nozawa\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            The rice is not only warm. It\u2019s seasoned with so much vinegar that it\u2019s almost pickled. This makes it appealingly energetic, a quality that sets it apart from the rest of the food.\n           \n\n            The fish is uniformly soft and pretty, but none of it tastes much like fish. Sweet shrimp and sea scallops were both exactly as they should be. But there was no heft to the tuna, no depth to the salmon, and anybody who happens to like shiny-skinned, fishy-tasting species like mackerel or sardines is in the wrong restaurant.\n           \n\n            The menu and website make much of Mr. Nozawa\u2019s connections among elite fishmongers, but the selection at Sugarfish rarely rises above entry level. The menu lists certain specials \u201cwhen available.\u201d Sea urchin is one; the last time I went, there wasn\u2019t any. This has to be the only sushi restaurant in New York that can\u2019t get its hands on sea urchin.\n           \n\n            Fresh wasabi may be too much to ask at Sugarfish\u2019s prices, but there is no wasabi at all under the fish. This is weird. Where sushi is concerned, wasabi isn\u2019t just a condiment. It\u2019s the air in the tires. Sugarfish lets you apply your own from some concentric bloops of stuff that tastes like watery horseradish and looks like a green version of the poop emoji, without the smile.\n           \n\n            By the end of my third meal, I was desperate for some break in the monotony. If Mr. Nozawa had suddenly materialized to yell at me, I would have given him flowers.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 86, "rating": "Fair", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/dining/sugarfish-by-sushi-nozawa-review.html", "google_mag": 19.5}, {"review_text": "\n            A friend who has made herself a regular at the SoHo restaurant\n            \n             King\n            \n            sums up its appeal, with deep approval, as \u201cfood on a plate in a room.\u201d This undersells the place \u2014 King offers much more than that \u2014 but she has a point.\n           \n\n            The restaurant, which opened in September, is not a show-off. The dining room is small, tidy and nearly square, painted the pale color of butter in the winter. Windows stretching to the ceiling along the north wall look out on the dormered Federal townhouses of King Street. The facing wall is broken up with a single abstract painting, a doorway to the kitchen and a long opening behind which the four people who make up the entire kitchen staff can be seen at work. It is a room content with being just a room, and letting you focus on the people you\u2019re with and the food that\u2019s on the plate.\n           \n\n            There will be papery curls of\n            \n             carta di musica\n            \n            before anything else arrives. Brushed with rosemary, this Sardinian flatbread shatters when you tap it. It will be gone in a minute, but it serves as a brief introduction to King\u2019s culinary realm.\n           \n\n            After this gift from the kitchen, an order of panisse may seem redundant. It isn\u2019t. At King, these chickpea fritters are long, thin tongues that puff up like pommes souffl\u00e9s and are scented all over by fried sage. They\u2019re beautiful. They were on the menu last month, but they may not stay long.\n           \n\n            Nothing does. King\u2019s two chefs, Jess Shadbolt and Clare de Boer, cook a different slate of dishes each night. The changes tend to be evolutionary, drawing from a fixed repertoire of ideas. The first time I had halibut there, it was grilled, and its skin had been deeply charred without drying out the rich white meat right under it. The plate was filled out with spinach and white coco beans soft enough to mash with a spoon.\n           \n\n            The next time I ate halibut at King, it was poached, the beans were back and the greens had been replaced with small artichoke hearts simmered in white wine and amaranth. I\u2019ll eat either dish again in a minute if the chefs give me a chance.\n           \n\n            Their food borrows liberally from the home cooking of those parts of Italy and France where New Yorkers of a certain generation dreamed of buying a summer house. This style has gone out lately, but a few years ago it was the default for the breed of American chefs who led their staff in fava-shucking parties each spring. Ms. Shadbolt and Ms. de Boer practice an English variant of the style they learned in the kitchen of\n            \n             the River Cafe\n            \n            in London.\n           \n\n            Anybody who\u2019s eaten at that restaurant or has gone to bed with one of its cookbooks will experience occasional flashbacks at King. Polenta and almond flour go into a classic River Cafe dessert and into a different one that recurs at King. If you see it on the menu, especially if it is weighted with nectarines, pounce.\n           \n\n            Chefs can\u2019t get far on imitation. They need to understand the how and why of things, and Ms. Shadbolt and Ms. de Boer do. Once you get past King\u2019s debt to River Cafe, what you really notice is how many little moves they know that can raise a recipe from good to exceptional.\n           \n\n            Olive oil blended with nettles is an excellent sauce for boiled fingerling potatoes. What makes King\u2019s even better is that a few fingerlings have been crushed into the pur\u00e9e, so from time to time you bite into a chunk of potato hiding inside the sauce. This was a side dish that traveled alongside a guinea hen, roasted whole with a bath of verdicchio in the bottom of the pan. Wilted nettles sprawled over its crisp skin. With a squeeze of lemon, it was one of the most appealing guinea hens I had ever come across.\n           \n\n            If you eat at King often, you can see the chefs making subtle adjustments to keep flavors in balance. Ravioli under spring peas and raw pea shoots were filled with minimally seasoned ricotta one week. The next, the ricotta inside floppy tortellini got an extra spur from lemon zest. The citrus might have stepped on the sweetness of the peas, but it helped the tortellini, because the only competition on the plate was fresh marjoram.\n           \n\n            And when some new seasonal ingredient appears on the scene, you can see the chefs strike like cobras. Saltwort, the salt-marsh-loving succulent that Italians call agretti, was the exciting foundation for a May salad built with wild arugula and raw ovals of asparagus stalks, making one of their first appearances of the year. Salty goldenrod bottarga was shaved over everything, even the white rim of the plate.\n           \n\n            To be won over by King, it helps not to expect things you\u2019ve never seen before. Even those meeting saltwort for the first time will find that the rest of the meal looks familiar. What Ms. de Boer and Ms. Shadbolt offer is not a wild vision of new ways to cook but a solid vision of how to eat. They put pleasure at the table above gymnastics on the plate. For reasons I don\u2019t want to understand, I associate this trait with other female chefs around town, including\n            \n             Rita Sodi\n            \n            ,\n            \n             Missy Robbins\n            \n            ,\n            \n             Gabrielle Hamilton\n            \n            ,\n            \n             Sara Jenkins\n            \n            ,\n            \n             Angie Mar\n            \n            and\n            \n             April Bloomfield\n            \n            , another River Cafe alumna.\n           \n\n            At King, the vision extends to how to drink. Annie Shi, who superintends the dining room and is a third business partner with the chefs, can offer guidance with the wine list. She favors French and Italian producers, many of them not quite famous, whose wines gracefully weave in and around the cooking.\n           \n\n            At the compact bar by the front door, cocktails are put together with the simplicity and respect for aperitif wines that you find in Italy. There is a kir and a sbagliato, which is nothing more than Campari and red vermouth on the rocks topped up with prosecco. These and other drinks slip into the bloodstream without knocking the palate out of alignment.\n           \n\n            The desserts are cafe style. They don\u2019t look like extraterrestrial landscapes but rather recognizable slices and scoops.\n           \n\n            One of the few things at King that didn\u2019t make perfect sense was a tiramis\u00f9; it went too heavy on the espresso and too light on the mascarpone. Every other dessert was just what I wanted, even when I didn\u2019t know I wanted it. Chilled, thickened cream flavored with Pernod? I\u2019m a fan now. I\u2019m also a new convert to something called the Colonel. It\u2019s a cup of lemon granita served with a tiny pitcher of cold vodka. You pour one over the other.\n           \n\n            I have no idea why the vodka makes the granita taste better, but it does.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 87, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/dining/king-restaurant-review-soho.html", "google_mag": 30.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n            Peru is making a move on Manhattan again.

Renew your friendship with causas and chaufas and leche de tigre, the milk of the tiger, without which there can be no ceviche.\n           \n\n            All these things and more are draped all over the menu at\n            \n             Sen Sakana\n            \n            , which is devoted to the food created by Japanese immigrants and their descendants in Peru. Non-Peruvians who know this hybrid cuisine at all probably first ran into it at a restaurant run by Nobu Matsuhisa, the Japanese-trained sushi chef who worked in Lima for a few years in the 1970s and\n            \n             helped himself\n            \n            to local ingredients and ideas. If you have ever eaten the raw fish with yuzu and a dot of rocoto chile paste that is\n            \n             Nobu\n            \n            \u2019s interpretation of tiradito, or its grilled skewers with spicy anticucho sauce, you have tasted Peru\u2019s Nikkei cuisine.\n           \n\n            At Sen Sakana, you can have more than a taste. The restaurant opened over the summer on the block of West 44th Street that is home to the Algonquin, the Royalton and the Iroquois hotels. There is room for almost 200 people in the square bar up front, the main dining room with rows of light wood tables and chairs in neutral upholstery, and a raised mezzanine that manages to make room for both extra tables and an entire sushi bar.\n           \n\n            To make this vastness look less like a warehouse and more like a Japanese restaurant, the designer made liberal use of slats. Some run up and down and the rest side to side, and behind some of those slats are lights that flood the walls with red or blue.\n           \n\n            It is the kind of sleek, sprawling, good-looking restaurant that you used to see all over Midtown, and then saw less often as the dining scene\u2019s center of gravity moved to smaller, handmade spaces downtown and across the East River, and are now starting to see again at, say,\n            \n             Empell\u00f3n\n            \n            and\n            \n             the Grill\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            Sprawling and sleek is not the current fashion, but it has also become apparent that small and handmade does not always mean high quality. Like any style, it can be faked. And one advantage of Sen Sakana\u2019s sprawl is that if you are working in Midtown when the quitting-time whistle blows, or are going there for a show, your chances of getting in are better than average.\n           \n\n            At six pages, the menu is a bit of a sprawl itself. Its many categories can, however, be distilled down to just four: appetizers, main courses, skewers and sushi.\n           \n\n            In the first group is a cold cucumber of unusual interest. Covered in crunchy quinoa, toasted sesame seeds and flakes of kelp intensified with soy, it sits on a yellow streak of sauce made from aji amarillo. The menu calls the cucumber yamitsuki, the Japanese word for addictive. I wouldn\u2019t go that far, but it does push a lot of good buttons at once.\n           \n\n            Gyoza, a half-dozen or so bound together by a crisp, shattering crepe-like lid, are filled with shrimp, crab and an exhilaratingly big jolt of fresh ginger. Sea bream tiradito gets a shower of shio kombu and two sauces; the tart yellow one is mango with aji amarillo and white soy; and the spicy green one is cilantro. Another tiradito sets raw bigeye tuna, daikon sprouts and pickled daikon in a lake of cilantro-jalape\u00f1o sauce.\n           \n\n            I\u2019d order any of these again, which I can\u2019t say about all the appetizers. Root vegetable chips were more oily than crisp. Sen Sakana also has a take on Japanese onigiri in which causa, the Peruvian whipped-potato constructions, are pinched inside sheets of nori. The idea is more interesting than the flavors; the potatoes needed seasoning, and the crab and chopped salmon fillings, advertised as spicy, weren\u2019t very.\n           \n\n            With the exception of undercrisped chicken skin, the skewers of meats and vegetables grilled over charcoal on a robata are worth investigating, especially the Japanese sweet potato with a melting slab of aji amarillo-spiked butter, and the pork belly stuffed with queso cremoso, which has the texture of mozzarella that is trying to turn itself into cream cheese.\n           \n\n            The short roster of main courses on the menu nearly gets lost. This wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing in the case of the skirt steak over tacu-tacu, a go-to rice-and-beans dish in Peru that becomes a flavorless paste here. But there are better choices, like a pleasantly unorthodox oyakodon, with an egg and chicken thigh over rice cooked with cilantro and pumpkin. And the chicken nanban removes any doubt that quinoa can make an effectively crunchy crust for fried chicken.\n           \n\n            Peru and Japan each have one representative in the main kitchen, where two chefs, Mina Newman and Taku Nagai, share power. Ms. Newman is a New Yorker who spent summers as a child in Chiclayo, the city in northwestern Peru where her mother was born. Mr. Nagai, an Osaka native, is a veteran of Japanese restaurants in New York and Asia. The two generally keep up with the number of seats and the size of the menu, although waits between courses sometimes drag.\n           \n\n            The dining room staff doesn\u2019t seem as well organized. My servers were cheerful and communicated well with customers, but not necessarily with each other. Three people in a row would stop by to ask the same question, and just clearing the table seemed to take a cast of hundreds.\n           \n\n            A third chef, named Sang Hyun Lee, presides over the free-standing sushi bar. His work ranges from simple, classic nigiri and sashimi to psychedelic, 10-ingredient inside-out rolls that might make\n            \n             Jiro Ono\n            \n            cross-eyed.\n           \n\n            Sen Sakana\u2019s best sushi is somewhere in between: what Mr. Lee calls Nikkei sashimi and nigiri. Augmented with Peruvian or Japanese flavors, these pieces are only slightly out of bounds, and can be delicious. There\u2019s pleasurable tension in topping raw scallop with a tiny fleck of yuzu-ponzu jelly and commas of shaved lemon peel, or brushing sea bream with a tart, spicy sauce of yuzu and aji amarillo, then dotting it with a tiny bit of salted plum paste. Add six more things and they would all start to collide somewhere over the Pacific.\n           \n\n            One dessert is a small waffle made from batter that contains squash and sweet potato, a homage to Peruvian picarones, with a dark molasses syrup. Another is a shallow-pan chocolate tres leches cake, which tasted something like a dense brownie over which somebody poured a glass of cocktail de algarrobina, Peru\u2019s answer to eggnog. It had never occurred to me to soak a brownie in eggnog. \u201cDoes this make sense?\u201d I asked, between bites, until it was gone.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 89, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/dining/sen-sakana-review-peruvian-food-nikkei.html", "google_mag": 24.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n            L\u2019Atelier de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon may be the world\u2019s most expensive restaurant chain. Each time I ate in\n            \n             the newest one\n            \n            , which opened across 10th Avenue from Chelsea Market in November, I listened to people around me compare notes on which of the 11 other locations they\u2019d visited. Tokyo was popular, as were Las Vegas and, of course, the original in Paris.\n           \n\n            As they reeled off their Atelier achievements, these people always sounded contented. And it must be soothing to know that as you travel the world you will find an Atelier waiting for you to climb up on a comfortable red leather stool, watch the cooks dressed in what look like black pajamas, admire the slightly supernatural colors of the vegetables and fruits submerged in water inside glass vases, recline into a menu filled with Robuchon classics and small variations on the same key ingredients (eggplant, quail, squab, lobster), all at prices that most people can\u2019t afford, but you can.\n           \n\n            Lulling familiarity was not Jo\u00ebl Robuchon\u2019s aim when he built the first Atelier almost 15 years ago. Having won just about every honor the French gastronomic world offers at his first restaurant, he had officially retired, and when he came back it was only to knock the whole system on its side. His idea was a restaurant where the food, made to his excruciatingly precise standards, would be served not at tables but at a U-shaped counter. The format may have been borrowed from Japan or Spain, but in France the effect was radical, as were the late-night closing hours and no-reservations policy.\n           \n\n            The proof of L\u2019Atelier\u2019s success is how un-shocking this sounds today.\n           \n\n            Early on,\n            \n             as R.W. Apple reported\n            \n            in The New York Times, the prices could be modest \u201cif you avoid caviar and foie gras.\u201d This was less true by the time of L\u2019Atelier de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon\u2019s initial New York run, at the Four Seasons Hotel in Midtown from 2006 to 2012, where Frank Bruni awarded it\n            \n             three stars\n            \n            . I remember feeling distinct pain there each time I paid the check.\n           \n\n            I also remember a stunned awareness that I\u2019d do it again. I had had no idea anything could taste as good as the simple combination of a langoustine and a basil leaf inside a see-through wrapper of fried brik pastry, or the far more complex glass of sea urchin suspended in lobster jelly under a quarter-inch of cauliflower cream that was like an insanely luxurious Jell-O salad.\n           \n\n            Nothing on the menu at the new Atelier spun my senses around like those two dishes, not even the langoustine, which is on the menu there, too, but seems to have lost the juicy sweetness I remembered.\n           \n\n            The kitchen, directed by\n            \n             Christophe Bellanca\n            \n            , shows impressive discipline. (It serves not just L\u2019Atelier but a second restaurant, Le Grill de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon, which sits up front overlooking 10th Avenue.) Not one dot of sauce, and there are many, is out of place. But some crucial connection has been lost, the spontaneity and directness that was, I think, the point of the Atelier experiment.\n           \n\n            Out of three dinners, my first was the most patchy. A $44 pair of mini-burgers topped with foie gras were more like an expensive caterer\u2019s trick than a Robuchon brain wave. A vaguely spiced mush of eggplant under a runny boiled egg, for $32, was so unappealing I couldn\u2019t finish it.\n           \n\n            Things got better from there, and sometimes much better, though rarely much cheaper. Those two dishes were what the menu calls \u201csmall tasting portions,\u201d and as you\u2019d imagine, the appetizers and main courses come with higher prices. Three tasting menus, from $145 to $325, are not particular bargains. (Taking some of the edge off, service is included.)\n           \n\n            Mr. Bellanca and his crew are at their best with careful refinements of classic French cooking. Slabs of roasted duck breast with cracked pepper and kumquat preserves, which I had in a main-course portion for $64, did everything you\u2019d want canard \u00e0 l\u2019orange to do, and did it with style and confidence. There was a handsomely improved $42 blanquette of veal cheeks with tender-crisp vegetables and a little disc of buttered rice pilaf.\n           \n\n            The beef tartare is chopped to little pieces but not beyond, smoothed with egg yolk, dressed with enough mustard to make it stand out in a crowd, and served with the fries that McDonald\u2019s sells only in my dreams. It comes close to being a model of the form in every way except the price, $52.\n           \n\n            The $34 beet salad was full of adventure, starting with a throat-catching scoop of green-mustard sorbet and continuing with some of those famous Robuchon dots, each of which turned out to be a perfectly delicious sauce made from, say, green apples or avocado. But not many other dishes seemed interested in startling anyone.\n           \n\n            The most spectacular thing I ate did not come from the kitchen but from the bakery downstairs.\n            \n             Tetsuya Yamaguchi\n            \n            , who has been tending yeast in Mr. Robuchon\u2019s empire for two decades, is now stationed in the basement on 10th Avenue. His masterpiece is called the escargot, a swirl of savory brioche dough with olive oil between its many warm and flaky layers. He also bakes baguettes that seem to be shrunken versions of full-scale ones; at that size they could be all crust, but somehow he keeps the crust in proportion with the rest, and they are a joy to eat.\n           \n\n            Meanwhile the pastry chef,\n            \n             Salvatore Martone\n            \n            , is making some of the finest and airiest chocolate souffl\u00e9s in the city, like dark-chocolate vapor tricked into solid form. He disguises a tarte Tatin as a shiny red Snow White apple; in another optical illusion, he fashions a replica of a lemon out of blown sugar, then fills it with lemon sorbet, and while I wished it tasted as much like lemon as it looked, it was a good dessert.\n           \n\n            Those are Mr. Martone\u2019s excellent chocolates that show up around the same time as the check, and his\n            \n             kugelhopf\n            \n            that will be waiting for you in a Robuchon shopping bag by the coat check in case you want to start the next day with a custard cake, and why wouldn\u2019t you?\n           \n\n            The service strikes a rare balance of charm and formality that was missing from the uptown location. There will be smiles when you get there, and smiles later when you whisk your kugelhopf off to wherever it is you go with your kugelhopfs.\n           \n\n            Whether this is a restaurant for you is first of all a question of money; there is no way to eat a satisfying meal at L\u2019Atelier without spending a lot of it. If the prices don\u2019t bother you, then neither should my nagging sense that the cooking is not as exciting as it could be. Nobody goes to chains, even expensive ones, for new sensations.\n           \n\n\n             Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n            \n            ,\n            \n             Instagram\n            \n            ,\n            \n             Twitter\n            \n            and\n            \n             Pinterest\n            \n            .\n            \n             Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n            \n            .\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 92, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/dining/latelier-de-joel-robuchon-review.html", "google_mag": 26.399999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n         First things first. Let\u2019s drink some wine.\n        \n\n         Going to\n         \n          Pearl & Ash\n         \n         without opening a bottle or two is like buying a chocolate bar and not unwrapping it. Since it opened in February, the restaurant has become the city\u2019s most exciting place to drink wine. Some nights the dining room is so packed with grape chasers, it\u2019s as if a Bat Signal in the shape of a corkscrew were shining over the Bowery. Michel Couvreux from Per Se and other sommeliers will be hunched on a backless bench, and Mike D will be weighing the merits of a Bordeaux that was fermented around the same time he was recording the first Beastie Boys album.\n        \n\n         Here, have a look at\n         \n          the list\n         \n         . It was compiled by that dude in the Black Flag T-shirt under an untucked, unsnapped cowboy shirt. His name is\n         \n          Patrick Cappiello\n         \n         , and he didn\u2019t dress that way when he was the wine director at Gilt, but he\u2019s a partner at Pearl & Ash, and I guess he gets to set his own dress code.\n        \n\n         Check out how many of his bottles have a little age on them. At other restaurants with wines like that, the prices are almost always deal-breakers. An amazingly vibrant 11-year old Mosel sp\u00e4tlese riesling from Karth\u00e4userhof is $59. We could splash around in Burgundy\u2019s kiddie pool, with a 2007 premier cru Nuits-St.-Georges from Jacques-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mugnier, whose wines induce spasms of mysticism in pinot noir fanatics. It\u2019s a relative steal at $130, but the waters get deeper as you move into older vintages, some of them drawn from the cellar of a serious collector Mr. Cappiello knows.\n        \n\n         If you know how much these bottles usually cost, you\u2019ll notice that Pearl & Ash has very humane markups. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll just notice that you are drinking at a higher level than your budget usually permits.\n        \n\n         Now let\u2019s eat. That riesling will get along wonderfully with the raw sea scallops under a dusky sprinkle of berbere, the complex Ethiopian spice blend that throbs with chiles and dried ginger. Those lightly charred curls of lily bulb around the plate have a floral sweetness that reminds me of pears; that pale green tangle under the scallops is a bit of tartly dressed fennel salad. It\u2019s a terrific appetizer.\n        \n\n         We should definitely get that thing called \u201changer, egg, cocoa, melba,\u201d because it\u2019s a really good spin on steak tartare. Harissa turns the chopped beef rust-colored and resolutely spicy; cracked nibs of cocoa give it a little depth; those shards of Melba toast sticking out like plates on the back of a stegosaurus are convenient scoops; and that yellow creek of lightly cooked yolk smooths out everything.\n        \n\n         Try smearing some \u201cchicken butter,\u201d maple-sweetened schmaltz with cow\u2019s milk butter, on this warm, tender, smoky whole-wheat bread. Kind of tastes like bacon, somehow, right? I know, I don\u2019t like paying for bread, either, but it\u2019s only $3. And we have to get these tender and supernaturally creamy fried sweetbreads with a pur\u00e9e of hearts of palm and tiny pickled beech mushrooms.\n        \n\n         The croquettes of duck confit sound good and look crunchy, but we\u2019ll skip them. They are about as crisp as frozen Tater Tots warmed up in a toaster oven, and the shredded duck inside is a little mushy. And I know the veal cheek with forbidden rice sounds great, but let\u2019s not. The rice comes in these oyster-size dehydrated clumps, which are so hard you can barely cut them. It\u2019s like eating moon rocks.\n        \n\n         We\u2019ll be much better off with the skirt steak, poached with hay in extreme slow motion for two days. It\u2019s wildly tender but not so soft you can\u2019t chew it, which brings out the herbal, woodsy flavor donated by the hay. Great, right?\n        \n\n         The man in white who\u2019s standing at the pass with his back to us is the chef, Richard Kuo. He was born in Taiwan and later moved to Australia. He got his early training there, which may be why he is so fluent with spices and Asian flavors. Here, try this octopus. Not everybody likes it, but I think it\u2019s fantastic. Looks burned, right? But it\u2019s just the togarashi spice blend that makes it so dark \u2014 that and a blast in searing oil. But even though it\u2019s crunchy as a corn flake outside, it\u2019s still tender on the inside. That pale, sand-colored sauce is a kind of tahini made of sunflower seeds. I like it as a foil for the heat of the togarashi.\n        \n\n         In New York, Mr. Kuo studied the modernist tool kits at WD-50 and Corton. His cooking at Pearl & Ash isn\u2019t aggressively avant-garde, but if you pay attention, you catch glimmers of it in that slow-poached steak or the supremely smooth pur\u00e9e of cauliflower with pan-fried skate. (I\u2019m not sure we should order the skate, though, unless he has dialed back the black pepper, chiles and paprika in the chermoula marinade; it walked all over the sweetness of the fish.)\n        \n\n         The last time I saw Mr. Kuo, he was sharing the kitchen with Fredrik Berselius at\n         \n          Frej\n         \n         , a pop-up in Williamsburg that was open three nights a week for about seven months. The cooking there was delicate and lovely, but its rather narrow band of Scandinavian flavors didn\u2019t suggest the exuberant range of tastes he has wheeled out at Pearl & Ash.\n        \n\n         Some people who\u2019ve gone to Pearl & Ash seem confused about what kind of restaurant it is. The menu is heavy on small plates, but then the dishes under the meat and fish headings can also be prepared in main-course sizes. You can cover the table with a carnival of little dishes, or start with an appetizer and proceed to an entree. Whatever. Let\u2019s just call it a very high-functioning wine bar that offers one of the best values in the city, and move on.\n        \n\n         Speaking of moving on, there are a couple of ways we can go with dessert. There\u2019s the composed plate with some dense lemon poundcake scattered around rings of very pure-tasting, half-frozen coffee parfait that look like miniature doughnuts. Then there\u2019s a Fernet-Branca ice cream sandwich, a dish that\u2019s as polarizing as Fernet-Branca itself. The ice cream plays down the bitterness of the liqueur and brings out its herbal and minty flavors, but you might be one of the people who thinks that the smiley face drawn on the sandwich\u2019s paper wrapper is an ironic joke.\n        \n\n         Either way, let\u2019s call over Mr. Cappiello to ask about one of the three Madeiras he pours by the glass. Or, if you\u2019re feeling kind of YOLO about that $150 in your pocket, we can get a half bottle of Sauternes, like the Ch\u00e2teau Suduiraut, stunningly fresh for a wine from 1975.\n        \n\n         Right. Let\u2019s drink some wine.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 93, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/08/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-pearl-ash-on-the-bowery.html", "google_mag": 26.600000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n            A little skepticism is in order when you hear about the work history of a chef running a kitchen for the first time. As frequent diners know from sad experience, it is, in fact, possible to cook in an acclaimed restaurant without picking up any of the qualities that it\u2019s acclaimed for. Even when actual skills have been learned, they are not always obvious. Or, occasionally, they\u2019re all too obvious, and you\u2019ll catch somebody in a two-person kitchen trying to replicate dishes originally assembled by a team of 40.\n           \n\n            One interesting thing about Soogil Lim is that you can almost draw a straight line from his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to what\u2019s on the table at his four-month-old restaurant in the East Village,\n            \n             Soogil\n            \n            . It\u2019s easy to spot the imprint of Hooni Kim\u2019s\n            \n             Hanjan\n            \n            , where he was the executive chef for four years. Mr. Lim lived in South Korea until he was 28, so what he learned at Hanjan was not how to make the country\u2019s traditional food but how to rework it into appealing, contemporary small plates.\n           \n\n\n             Daniel\n            \n            , where he spent seven years and reached the rank of sous-chef, turns up in the French techniques Mr. Lim leans on, in the crisp presentations that carry an echo of nouvelle cuisine, in the tender braised short rib, in his fondness for foie gras and in his preference for skillfully modulating flavors rather than tossing umami grenades.\n           \n\n            It\u2019s also apparent, when you look around the dining room, that in his earlier jobs Mr. Lim spent most of his time in the kitchen; the lineage you taste in his cooking doesn\u2019t show up in the design. Soogil (SOO-gil) doesn\u2019t evoke a rambunctious Korean pub the way Hanjan does. Nor is it a carpeted and tableclothed luxury liner, like Daniel.\n           \n\n            Under the guidance of Mr. Lim\u2019s wife, Sasook Youn, the dining room has been done in what we now recognize as the all-purpose Modern Asian style \u2014 a long banquette of blond wood against one wall, a dining counter facing another wall, and a long communal table with benches running down the middle, all of them sitting on a plank floor. A few framed prints by Suzy Taekyung Kim, a New York artist from South Korea, are suspended over the banquettes. French windows on the street can be thrown open if the weather ever cooperates.\n           \n\n            Hanging in the back is a curtain. Once in a while it parts just wide enough for Mr. Lim\u2019s face to appear while he scans the tables. Sometimes they are full.\n           \n\n            They should be full all the time, because cooking like this does not just sprout up through every crack in the sidewalk, particularly at prices that, with one or two exceptions, don\u2019t go over $20.\n           \n\n            A good window into Mr. Lim\u2019s mind is the bindaetteok appetizer. Usually\n            \n             these mung bean pancakes\n            \n            present as flat, starchy discs whose golden surfaces hint at crunchiness without actually delivering it. The ones at Soogil, fried in pork fat, have golden crusts like veal cutlets; by the time you\u2019ve speared a piece with some chopped kimchi and dunked it in the traditional dipping sauce, you have all the expected flavors, plus a formidable crunch to sweeten the deal.\n           \n\n            He tinkers with the glass noodle dish called\n            \n             japchae\n            \n            in less radical fashion. The noodles themselves, shaped into a swirl with crisp shreds of vegetables and oyster mushrooms, have drunk in more soy and sesame flavor than they typically do. And Mr. Lim seems to have tripled, at least, the amount of bulgogi, a point he emphasizes by mounding the meat over the noodles so it looks like a sloppy Joe missing its top bun.\n           \n\n            The care the kitchen pays to technique is obvious in the seafood dishes; I\u2019ve never had one that wasn\u2019t perfectly cooked. Monkfish, which can come off as a rubber replica of some part of the anatomy I\u2019d rather not think about, gets wrapped in a cabbage or lettuce leaf, gently poached, and sliced into neat little wheels. Arranged over stir-fried vegetables in a sea of fermented chile sauce, it\u2019s terrific, and about as French as Korean cooking should be allowed to get.\n           \n\n            An almost silky consistency marks the mackerel that Soogil serves, nigiri-style, over wads of rice that have been seasoned with ssamjang (standing in for wasabi?) and wrapped in chard leaves.\n           \n\n            The tender Manila clams, squid and shrimp in the spicy tofu-seafood stew kept more of their natural juiciness than usual, although very firm shellfish isn\u2019t necessarily a defect in that dish. Mr. Lim herds all the soft tofu into a flan at the bottom of the bowl, rather than letting cubes of it fend for themselves in the broth \u2014 a move that nicely heightens the contrast of tofu and chiles.\n           \n\n            The least Korean thing on the menu must be the foie gras terrine, and it\u2019s also one of the only disappointments, with its crumbly Melba toasts and washed-out green-plum jelly. A dish called nurungji gras is something else entirely: a fine seared hunk of foie gras laid over spinach and pickled mushrooms on a springy, crunchy sizzled rice cake.\n           \n\n            Slabs of pork belly are braised until the fat streaks are nearly liquid. Then they\u2019re given a meaningful sear and served alongside a stripe of a sauce I\u2019ve never had before, made with fermented shrimp and green plums and fresh red peppers: spicy, salty, sour and hot.\n           \n\n            The dish that breaks the $20 barrier is the short rib. If you\u2019ve had\n            \n             Daniel\u2019s braised short ribs\n            \n            , the tenderness and concentration will be familiar to you, although Soogil\u2019s version is pointedly suffused with soy rather than red wine. Underlining the French connection, this block of beef is served with carrots, potatoes and winter squash. If you eat it by yourself, you could make dinner of it.\n           \n\n            After which you should probably investigate something that goes by the name Jenga Tower. Cigarettes of fried dough, chewy like rice sticks, are stacked like a log cabin, then dusted with sugar and misugaru, the powdered grain and bean blend Koreans use as an instant breakfast drink. You pull out a stick at the time until the tower falls and brings down the scoop of honey-and-chestnut gelato balanced on top.\n           \n\n            The dining room could take a few lessons in balance from that dessert. The lights could be dimmed by a few clicks. The pop music, while not actively awful, is just odd enough to be subliminally distracting. Soogil can\u2019t seem to find the right tone for service, either. Some nights it\u2019s very familiar and on others, peculiarly fussy \u2014 a server insisted on giving the book I\u2019d brought a chair of its own.\n           \n\n            These are minor snags, but sorting them out is tricky, especially for first-time restaurateurs. Somewhere in the middle is a relaxed, confident style that will match the spirit of Mr. Lim\u2019s cooking.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 94, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/dining/soogil-review-east-village.html", "google_mag": 22.899999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n            I was drinking gin and pineapple juice at the bar of Gabriel Stulman\u2019s newest restaurant,\n            \n             Simon & the Whale\n            \n            , and tasting folds of tongue pastrami laid over caramelized cauliflower, a combination that paid off against long odds, when applause broke out by the entrance. I hadn\u2019t heard anyone drop a glass or sing \u201cHappy Birthday,\u201d so I asked the woman next to me, who had eaten there three or four times already, if she knew what the sudden ovation was about.\n           \n\n            \u201cHave you been to Gabe\u2019s other places?\u201d she asked. \u201cThey like to clap for people.\u201d\n           \n\n            I hadn\u2019t noticed that, but there were other Stulman touches that had been transferred from Bar Sardine,\n            \n             Jeffrey\u2019s Grocery\n            \n            ,\n            \n             Fedora\n            \n            and\n            \n             Joseph Leonard\n            \n            to Simon & the Whale when it opened in February. Case studies in how to maximize miniature spaces, they are intimate neighborhood hangouts with elevator-size kitchens where the food and cocktails are more interesting than ought to be achievable under such conditions. It\u2019s a genre Mr. Stulman understands as well as anybody in the city.\n           \n\n            With 76 seats in the new Freehand hotel on East 23rd Street, Simon & the Whale isn\u2019t one of those. It\u2019s an Army mess hall by the standards of Mr. Stulman\u2019s\n            \n             Happy Cooking Hospitality\n            \n            group. But the design firm\n            \n             Roman and Williams\n            \n            has styled it like a California Craftsman house and subdivided it into niches and corners with open cabinets. It doesn\u2019t display its size the way\n            \n             Upland\n            \n            , another Roman and Williams project a few blocks north, does. Even the bar is personably scaled; it\u2019s configured like a horseshoe. Extensive personal research suggests this is the best possible shape a bar can have.\n           \n\n            Like all of Mr. Stulman\u2019s places, Simon & the Whale is thick with high-volume conversations when it is full, which is pretty much all night long. Like Jeffrey\u2019s Grocery and Joseph Leonard, its name comes from a relative \u2014 in this case, Mr. Stulman\u2019s 6-year-old son, who apparently received an impressive collection of whale-decorated baby gifts.\n           \n\n            Also familiar to Mr. Stulman\u2019s regulars will be the style of the servers. They\u2019re young, talkative, fresh-faced, enthusiastic, as if they are new to the city and haven\u2019t yet grown the protective exoskeleton of the hardened New Yorker.\n           \n\n            Our waiter one night showered us with recommendations for dishes, all of which he loved. We asked him about things he hadn\u2019t mentioned. He loved those, too. He loved the cocktails, a Happy Cooking strong suit, and was especially keen on one made with mezcal. \u201cMezcal never hurt anybody,\u201d he said brightly. Extensive personal research suggests this is untrue.\n           \n\n            One place where Simon & the Whale allows itself to spread out beyond the normal boundaries of the Stulman kingdom is breads and desserts. The restaurant shares a baker, Zoe Kanan, and a pastry chef, Charmaine McFarlane, with the hotel\u2019s second-floor cafe, Studio, also run by Happy Cooking. Both are very good at their jobs.\n           \n\n            Ms. Kanan makes the black, thick-crusted barley-rye bread flecked with anise seeds that comes with a halfhearted taramosalata and, more excitingly, a swipe of butter creamed with seaweed powder. The long thin toast, crackling with grains and seeds that sits under cured and smoked Arctic char and smoked sour cream? Hers. The poppy-seed torpedo roll that helps lift the fish sandwich with carrot-squash slaw above the ordinary? Also hers, although to be fair the long, flat fries also do their part.\n           \n\n            And if your spirits have been sunk, as mine have, by the\n            \n             skimpy and uninspired dessert choices\n            \n            around town these days, Ms. McFarlane will be an answered prayer. No mere afterthought, her panna cotta sits on a low base of semolina cake and is decked out with pink grapefruit fillets and grapefruit marmalade spiced with red juniper berries. A cooling evergreen moat of pine ice surrounds an earthy rye pudding that\u2019s enriched with brown butter; pears fried in honey are splayed out on top, and some acerbic cranberries prevent the whole thing from cloying. I defy you to eat it without smiling.\n           \n\n            I can\u2019t say I\u2019m as taken with crunchy knotweed-rhubarb compote as a topping for a buckwheat cake as Ms. McFarlane seems to be, but the same dessert offers one of the most astonishing ice creams around. Made with beeswax, it is as deeply aromatic as honey but not as sweet, and its texture is intensely creamy but not at all waxy.\n           \n\n            The rest of the menu is in the hands of Matt Griffin, until recently in charge of the food at Fedora and Bar Sardine. He does a neat balancing trick here, giving his adventurous side free rein at times while more often using it to add interest to the standards a hotel restaurant probably needs.\n           \n\n            A winningly over-the-top recent special was a custard-soaked pain perdu under bacon jus, pickled cabbage and speck, like some kind of demented Reuben-croque monsieur hybrid. Liver and onions turned out to be a less thrilling snack: pickled onions with deep-fried and overcooked chicken livers.\n           \n\n            Until it swam off the menu, there was an intriguing sideways version of squid ink risotto that had beech mushrooms and very tender squid confit over a black porridge of barley. Now there are spring peas, swirled with mint into a sauce for just-firm shrimp; the combination suggested pasta, but I was glad to have it without any starch getting in the way of the clear, sweet flavors.\n           \n\n            If it\u2019s pasta you want, Mr. Griffin has a glossy, chile-speckled bowl of spaghetti acqua pazza with littleneck clams and cherry tomatoes, and while the sauce is thicker and glossier than a normal acqua pazza, it is very good. What he calls a pork-collar Milanese is maybe a few millimeters too thick for the name, but I\u2019ll take it. The cut is more flavorful than a normal cutlet, and the apricot mostarda makes a pungent and welcome counterpoint.\n           \n\n            If you can\u2019t finish the whole thing, it will be taken away and replaced by a plastic action figure of a New York sports hero. This is your claim check. Mine was Don Mattingly, and I wondered if maybe the applause was for him.\n           \n\n            No, Mr. Stulman said on the phone a few days later. The woman he bought Fedora from, who has since died, was 89 when she sold it and was still showing up each night. When she entered, people clapped. \u201cWe turned that into clapping for our friends,\u201d he said.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 95, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/dining/simon-and-the-whale-restaurant-review-flatiron.html", "google_mag": 31.299999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n            \u201cGet ready for a lot of flavor.\u201d\n           \n\n            This was what an old hand with the menu at Don Peppe said as the first plates came to our table. He could have shortened that to \u201cget ready for a lot,\u201d or just \u201cget ready.\u201d Some preparation for the meal to come is definitely in order for the uninitiated, a word that on a typical day applies to nobody at this white-tablecloth red-sauce restaurant in South Ozone Park, Queens.\n           \n\n            Don Peppe novices need to know that certain items are not welcome on the premises, as listed on a sign on the front door: No Tank Tops, Hats, Strollers, Baby Carriages, Credit Cards.\n           \n\n            With these exceptions, the dress code is permissive and allows for pantsuits, polo shirts, track jackets, pleated trousers, wide shorts. The manager in charge of the waiting list one recent night \u2014 reservations aren\u2019t taken \u2014 had on a guayabera embroidered with a Yankees logo. Waiters wear white shirts and neckties. Bussers are dressed in black T-shirts with The Original Baked Clams printed on the back, a stirring if undocumented claim.\n           \n\n            Don Peppe is about half a mile north of a long-term parking lot for Kennedy International Airport and half a mile east of\n            \n             Aqueduct Racetrack\n            \n            . Seeing the jockey silks and photographs of thoroughbreds hanging on the walls, a first-timer might conclude that the restaurant has been a horse-themed clubhouse for touts, trainers, gamblers and bookmakers since the Damon Runyon era.\n           \n\n            In fact, the original racing d\u00e9cor, which dated back to the 1960s, when Don Peppe moved to Lefferts Boulevard from Brooklyn, was replaced by Italian landscape paintings many years ago as Aqueduct traffic faded. Michael DeLuca Sr., the owner, said the track crowd had started to come back recently, with bigger shares of the purse in their pockets. In their honor, he revived the equestrian motif.\n           \n\n            A person who knows of Don Peppe only as a scheme of Turtle\u2019s in\n            \n             an \u201cEntourage\u201d subplot\n            \n            may ask to see the wine list. Everybody at Don Peppe drinks the house white or the house red. Both come in bottles with no cork and no label. Both are well chilled. Both have the carefree good cheer of the very young.\n           \n\n            It would be a similar error to wait for menus. They are not printed on paper. Everything, the antipasti and pastas, the seafood, meat and desserts, is printed in white on a blackboard. If the sightlines were better, a person with good vision could read it from the other side of Lefferts Boulevard.\n           \n\n            Sitting in a corner, my guide couldn\u2019t see the menu and didn\u2019t need to. He mentioned about a dozen family-size dishes to the waiter: baked clams, fried peppers, the \u201cspecial salad,\u201d a pound of pasta (the minimum serving), another pound of pasta, veal cutlets and something called shrimp Luciano, which may or may not be named after Lucky Luciano.\n           \n\n            \u201cYou want linguine with the shrimp Luciano?\u201d the waiter asked.\n           \n\n            \u201cWhy not?\u201d So that was another pound.\n           \n\n            I thought my guide had finished, but he was merely pausing for breath. \u201cWe should get the chicken Chinese, just so you can try it,\u201d he said. \u201cOh, and the steak\u2019s not bad either. Let\u2019s get a porterhouse.\u201d\n           \n\n            As I was saying, it was a lot, and as he had warned me, a lot of flavor, although another way to put that would be to say a lot of garlic.\n           \n\n            Garlic chopped to a fine mist and warmed with clam juice and olive oil sloshes under the baked littlenecks, a dozen to an order. Spooned over the almost blackened crust of bread crumbs, this sauce is rich and gentle. It doesn\u2019t bully the freshly shucked clams, whose small size \u2014 inside their shells, many are no bigger than a quarter \u2014 helps distance Don Peppe from legions of other baked-clam artists around the city.\n           \n\n            Garlic in whole cloves is browned with onions and strips of red peppers in a pan hot enough to scare the peppers out of their skins. Called fried peppers, it\u2019s essentially a three-ingredient dish, five if you count black pepper and olive oil, and the first time you eat it you can\u2019t quite believe how far the flavors take you. One person I ate with insisted that the peppers had to have been laced with sugar.\n           \n\n            A more likely explanation is that the kitchen makes these dishes and others the way they are supposed to be made, adding a few flourishes of its own. This is a rare thing. Italian-American restaurant cooking is not an endangered species in New York just yet, but enough of its practitioners have closed or slumped into irrelevance to raise concerns about gene pool dilution. Don Peppe is one of the few exemplars where pride and purpose, both essential to this cuisine, remain intact. Mr. DeLuca employs three chefs, all charged with following recipes that in most cases go back more than 100 years, to when the restaurant was founded by a Neapolitan who went by the name Don Peppe. (His full name and the exact date were forgotten many baked clams ago.)\n           \n\n            Those pounds of pasta are one place where the difference is plain. White clam sauce can be a thin soup with stray eraser tips, or it can be, as it is at Don Peppe, a concentrated broth that sinks deep into the pasta, which sits under a wide swath of chopped fresh clams and parsley. The pomodoro sauce is a thick, profoundly red gravy that doesn\u2019t cast a watery pool on the bottom of the plate. The same sauce, or one close to it, is the bed for shells stuffed with ricotta, topped with mozzarella and run under the broiler long enough to put a crackle on the lips of the shells.\n           \n\n            The meat sauce is just meat sauce. The marinara, though, is what every jarred sauce on the market wishes it could be.\n           \n\n            Beginners may need to have a few menu items decoded. Don Peppe special salad: iceberg, tomatoes, salami, provolone and so forth, in a huge bowl. It sounds ordinary but somehow it isn\u2019t. Shrimp Luciano: shrimp in a garlic-butter sauce turned sunset pink by a rumor of tomatoes. It\u2019s great, and there\u2019s no reason not to have it over pasta. Veal Don Peppe: chopped raw tomatoes, red peppers and onions ladled over a breaded cutlet that you could slice with a wooden spoon. Chicken Chinese: cut-up chicken in a tomato sauce reduced to a brownish jam.\n           \n\n            The least compelling of these is the chicken Chinese, the subject of a homage on\n            \n             Carbone\n            \n            \u2019s opening menu. (It didn\u2019t make sense there, either.) At Don Peppe, it tends toward dryness, an affliction that can also touch the chicken scarpariello.\n           \n\n            In several return visits, I noticed regulars eating things not advertised on the menu \u2014 stuffed peppers, a porterhouse, a tomahawk chop with a bone that you could use to prop up a car hood. The beef is better than you might expect but will not give you the false impression that Don Peppe is a steakhouse.\n           \n\n            The best dessert is probably the cheesecake. The rest are what kids in Bay Ridge and Corona used to want on their birthdays: tortoni, tartufo, spumoni. Of course, the other people at your table will say they have no room for dessert. Even on your first visit, you\u2019ll know they don\u2019t mean it.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 96, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/20/dining/don-peppe-review-italian-american-restaurant-queens.html", "google_mag": 24.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n            New York is supposed to be tough on out-of-town chefs who go into business here. In reality, it\u2019s tough on chefs of all kinds. Distance simply multiplies the difficulties, and competition weeds out the unprepared.\n           \n\n            For long commutes, few chefs can top the one that Meir Adoni has been making since he opened a Middle Eastern restaurant called\n            \n             Nur\n            \n            on East 20th Street in April. He splits his time between Manhattan; Tel Aviv, the site of his two other restaurants; and his home outside Jerusalem. In Israel, he\u2019s got a full dance card; he has published a cookbook app and has a leading role in a popular Israeli cooking-contest show called\n            \n             \u201cGame of Chefs,\u201d\n            \n            where he is both a mentor to one of the teams and a judge. (Television viewers in Israel must have different ideas about impartiality.)\n           \n\n            Running a new restaurant in New York tends to be more than a half-time job, and yet Nur doesn\u2019t have the lethargy and mechanical quality of a kitchen run by remote control. The plates have energy. At times, in fact, they don\u2019t know when to quit. The sauces and powders and garnishes proliferate so quickly that it\u2019s hard to keep count. But it\u2019s easier for a new restaurant to settle down after an excess of high spirits than to recover from a tentative start.\n           \n\n            The swirl of flavors also reflects Mr. Adoni\u2019s expansive definition of the food of the Middle East. Nur\u2019s menu embraces Morocco and Libya in North Africa, in addition to Israel, Yemen and Syria; again, it\u2019s hard to keep count. His vision of his part of the globe is pluralistic.\n           \n\n            Inspired by the Arab cooks working in Mr. Adoni\u2019s Tel Aviv restaurants, Nur\u2019s Palestinian tartare begins with mounds of raw beef and adds layer upon layer of complication. Pine nuts, tender young favas, pickled onions, slices of green chiles, broccolini florets, sumac powder and micro-sprouts are strewn over at least three sauces, including a pitch-dark and smoky eggplant pur\u00e9e and a very good sheep-milk yogurt. All of this flirts with chaos, but it doesn\u2019t topple over.\n           \n\n            Nur turns an Arab dessert, the folded pancakes called qatayef, into fried savory pies filled with a mince of spiced lamb. There is some sweetness in the dough and a fair amount of delicious fat in the lamb, so a break from the richness comes in the form of cucumber spears and salted green almonds. Maybe the yogurt-mint sauce would work better as a dip than a \u201cchaser\u201d served in a shot glass, but the flavors are right.\n           \n\n            Born in southern Israel to a Moroccan family, Mr. Adoni draws on some of the cooking of that culture. The Moroccan fritters known as sfenj are the basis of an odd and appealing appetizer he calls a date doughnut. Although it is sweetened by dates it could just as easily be seen as a smoked trout beignet, or, when you get right down to it, a fish cake. The sauce is an intense sweet-and-sour citrus vinaigrette with curry powder lurking in it; a few drops go a long way.\n           \n\n            Like the chatter of a nervous guest at a party, the hyperactivity of certain dishes probably comes from a desire to impress. But the quieter plates can be just as remarkable, sometimes more so. There is a suave and very good seafood stew that is a cross between bouillabaisse and chraime, the Moroccan braise of fish in spicy tomato sauce.\n           \n\n            On the side is a bowl of what has to be the finest couscous I\u2019ve ever eaten in a restaurant. Mr. Adoni says he\n            \n             learned to make the fluffy little semolina crumbs\n            \n            from a Libyan woman. Also from Libya is the scoop of tershi that sits atop the couscous. Made from pumpkin, eggplant and harissa, it is sweet, spicy and terrific.\n           \n\n            One factor in Nur\u2019s early success \u2014 the small dining room has been thronged every time I\u2019ve gone \u2014 is Mr. Adoni\u2019s business partner and guide to local customs, Gadi Peleg. An owner of Breads Bakery, a champion producer of babka and rugelach, Mr. Peleg found the space, which crouches three steps below grade, beneath an eyelash-extension salon.\n           \n\n            The ceilings are low. The layout is tight. The service is familiar and opinionated about the menu. (Almost all the opinions are positive.) The place looks and acts, in other words, like a New York restaurant. It sounds like one, too, when all the seats are taken and raised voices start careening off the ceiling. Oddly enough, the bar is relatively quiet, and not a bad place to eat if you want to have a conversation.\n           \n\n            Mr. Peleg had a hand in the menu, and makes all the breads at his bakery from Mr. Adoni\u2019s recipes. There is a miniature loaf of challah brushed with honey, salt and golden flakes of garlic; a kind of Yemenite monkey bread, flecked with nigella seeds, called\n            \n             kubaneh\n            \n            ; and a sesame-blitzed Jerusalem bagel the size of a small bath mat.\n           \n\n            I recommend trying all three. Probably not on the same night.\n           \n\n            With all the ideas zinging around Nur\u2019s menu, a few are bound to veer off in the wrong direction. The brazenly trayf gefilte shrimp, buried under pebbles of dashi jelly, doesn\u2019t open up the way it should; both it and the jelly are too firm to melt on the tongue. A main course of octopus shimmers under a fine spice glaze, but gets wrong-footed by a jumble of sauces.\n           \n\n            Sea scallops, another main course, get along better with just one good sauce, a tart sorrel pur\u00e9e with an undercurrent of cumin. If the kitchen can do something about the awful, overcooked nuggets of ricotta gnudi, it would be onto something.\n           \n\n            Lisa Meisenger, the pastry chef, is certainly with the program. For a recent special, she scattered some juicy, dark strawberries over a bay-leaf custard with candied walnuts and pine-nut brittle. Rounded out with a scoop of mastic ice cream and decorated with flowers and edible gold, it was one of the more straightforward desserts.\n           \n\n            Something going by the name of chocolate cassata is made up of three small sandwiches of pistachio ice cream between almond cookies. They are nearly engulfed by chocolate foam, cherries in syrup, orange zest and candied pistachio. It is hectic, but delicious.\n           \n\n            Mr. Adoni said he would like to open a second New York restaurant. Selfishly, I\u2019m hoping it will be North African; he could build an entire menu around that Libyan couscous. But he has his sights on a kosher restaurant. If he can use ingredients as vibrant as those at Nur, and keep the prices from soaring out the window, it would be a real achievement.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 97, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/08/dining/nur-review-middle-eastern-restaurant.html", "google_mag": 27.200000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n            Since Atla ambled up to the corner of Lafayette and Great Jones Streets this spring, all the people who run to every new opening in town have been telling me they want to eat chilaquiles for breakfast there; they want the chicken enchiladas for lunch; they want to hide from the afternoon sun with a tall glass of iced tepache, a tingling, off-dry agua fresca Atla makes by letting sugar ferment with pineapple rinds.\n           \n\n            Sometimes, under their breath, they query a few of the prices at this casual Mexican cafe (\u201cFourteen dollars for radishes?\u201d), but I haven\u2019t talked to anyone who doesn\u2019t think Atla is an extremely likable place. Despite its fairly modest goals, or maybe because of them, Atla is one of the least divisive restaurants Manhattan has seen in some time. It\u2019s as if people, worn out by the sheer effort of being scandalized by the news, had decided that 2017 would be more bearable if we could all just find one thing to agree about. Atla is that thing.\n           \n\n            Opened by Enrique Olvera, the chef best known for Pujol in Mexico City, together with his proxy in New York, Daniela Soto-Innes, and their chef de cuisine, Hugo Vera, Atla knows just what it\u2019s doing without seeming to try. This combination is as attractive in a restaurant as it is in a person.\n           \n\n            One thing it is not trying to do is make a big statement. Mr. Olvera and Ms. Soto-Innes made their statement already, at Cosme, their more elaborate restaurant on East 21st Street, which is now nearly as well known as Pujol. Having proved at Cosme that they have original things to say about Mexican cuisine, they are set free at Atla to serve Mexican food that New Yorkers may want to eat every day. Which is not to say that this is the everyday cooking of Mexico.\n           \n\n            While Cosme specializes in the kind of layered, multicomponent dishes with which chefs make their mark, Atla\u2019s menu is simpler. The chilaquiles are just chilaquiles, tortilla chips in red or green salsa under white onions and a tangy crema. The chips are thick enough to keep their crunch, and they get more of it from a sprinkling of toasted flaxseeds.\n           \n\n            Flaxseeds are not a standard garnish for chilaquiles, but they are symptomatic of the contemporary strain of nutrient-conscious eating Atla displays. It has less in common with the sturdy cooking of traditional Mexican restaurants than with the modified health-food aesthetic of places like Dimes that cater to the yoga-mat crowd.\n           \n\n            Besides a regular cafe con leche Atla serves two versions with no dairy; one is made with cashew milk (a little odd) and another with coconut milk (wonderful). In any form, the cafe con leche is made with strong espresso, sweet enough to get along without sugar.\n           \n\n            Chia bowls usually bore me, despite their exemplary levels of omega-3 fatty acids, but the one at Atla held my attention. It\u2019s stirred with sweet Mexican cinnamon, like a semisolid horchata, and topped with candied ginger, pumpkin seeds and nuts.\n           \n\n            A number of dishes are flat-out salads, like the fine if not soul-stirring quinoa with cucumbers and pico de gallo. Others are salad-adjacent. Those $14 radishes, cool, crisp and skinny, surround a smooth avocado dip. The chunky guacamole is pounded with nearly enough tarragon, mint and basil to qualify as an herb salad. When it arrives it is nearly invisible under a single chile-dusted corn chip the color of a wet bluestone sidewalk, and the size of a flip-flop.\n           \n\n            A smaller, rounder blue masa chip, spread with farmer cheese and capers, is the foundation of the arctic char tostada. As an attempt to introduce Russ & Daughters to Mexico it is all right, but it doesn\u2019t go beyond that. The ceviche verde, on the other hand, is more dynamic than you expect, thanks to the fresh ginger in its tart green sauce, among other tricks.\n           \n\n            Depending on your metabolism, all this will leave you feeling either refreshed and ready to meet the day or slightly hungry. To make a lunch of the chilaquiles I needed to fortify the plate with poached chicken, bringing a $14 dish to $19.\n           \n\n            There are more substantial things to eat. Gray sole fried in a crunchy panko crust that tastes of garlic and butter is a complete meal. It comes with a small cucumber salad, like a Viennese schnitzel, although in Vienna they probably wouldn\u2019t bathe the cucumbers in herb juice and add green chiles and cilantro. Nor would they sell you a $3 plate of warm tortillas so you can make your own tacos. Maybe they should, though.\n           \n\n            The pambazo, meanwhile, is the traditional sandwich of chorizo and potatoes on a soft roll dipped in guajillo salsa. It\u2019s more or less the pambazo you would get out of a Oaxacan lunch truck if you were lucky enough to find one parked on Lafayette Street.\n           \n\n            Still, the overall lightness of the food has some bearing on the one real debate you could have about Atla. The question is not whether to go, but when. (People plan their meals at Cosme a week ahead or more, and while Atla takes reservations, going there tends to be a spur-of-the-moment decision.)\n           \n\n            The dining room\u2019s corner space is wrapped in plate glass. By day this invites the sunshine in and provides a wide-screen view of the endless fashion parade of NoHo. By night, when the eggs and other breakfast dishes roll off the menu and the room fills up with people more interested in mezcal and the \u201coverproof margarita\u201d than coffee and agua fresca, the windows become sounding boards.\n           \n\n            At times like this you may notice all the other hard surfaces, like the stone floor; you may wonder why only some of the seats have backs; you may be frustrated in your effort to keep all your plates and glasses on the small round table.\n           \n\n            The very qualities that make Atla ideal for a relaxed breakfast or lunch, in other words, make it a dinner destination that is best approached with a moderate appetite, a resilient lower back and a suspicion that whatever your friends are saying probably isn\u2019t important anyway. Better still, treat it as a drinking spot where food is an added attraction.\n           \n\n            For dessert there is a curious tamal topped with queso fresco. It\u2019s more salty than sweet, a minor-key reprise of the great corn-husk meringue at Cosme. The most appealing dessert I had was a roasted sweet potato under a caramelized pool of sweetened condensed milk. It is off the menu now, but I am telling you about it anyway because I suspect it will be back. I know I will.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.30000001192092896, "id": 98, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/dining/atla-review-mexican-restaurant-noho.html", "google_mag": 24.700000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n         Chase the scent of great barbecue in\n         \n\n\n          New York City\n         \n         , and you are rooting for a team that will, sooner or later, let you down. You are a Red Sox fan in any season from 1919 to 2003. There will be enough victories to keep the dream flickering, and there will be nights when you watch the ball hop between the first baseman\u2019s legs.\n        \n\n         But every loss feeds a new hope in your heart. This winter, hope came in threes. Barbecue hounds ran to Gowanus to get burnt ends and char siu pork steak at\n         \n          Fletcher\u2019s Brooklyn Barbecue\n         \n         , and to Williamsburg to find out whether\n         \n          BrisketTown\n         \n         deserved to be crowned the Brisket King of New York in a recent cook-off. They descended on the East Village to take apart Flintstonian beef ribs at Mighty Quinn\u2019s Barbeque and watch men in heavy black gloves grab pork shoulder by the fistful and shake it into dripping hunks \u2014 yes, real pulled pork on Second Avenue.\n        \n\n         All three places slow-cook their barbecue with hardwood only, no gas allowed. All three places serve meat that is largely raised on pastures or outdoors, including pork from old breeds with flavorful rosy flesh and a thick girdle of white fat that bastes the meat as it melts. All are worth noticing, and one of them, Mighty Quinn\u2019s, comes as close to delivering on all fronts as any barbecue place the city has seen so far.\n        \n\n         Mighty Quinn\u2019s got its start as a stall at\n         \n          Smorgasburg\n         \n         , the open-air souk for start-up deliciousness on the Brooklyn waterfront. Hugh Mangum, a drummer and cook who worked under\n         \n\n\n          Jean-Georges Vongerichten\n         \n         , drove there on weekends hauling brisket he had smoked in Hunterdon County, N.J. The meat was deliberately, slowly sliced, and the lines were notoriously long.\n        \n\n         A 30-minute wait could make a stale bagel taste good, so the greater efficiency of Mighty Quinn\u2019s operation makes it easier to evaluate Mr. Mangum\u2019s work.\n        \n\n         The restaurant, which opened in December, runs on the cafeteria model, with meat at the start of the assembly line, drinks at the end and shiny metal trays that you ferry to a table made of century-old spruce salvaged from the Puck Building. The counter workers are quick and usually friendly, although once when I asked for three-quarters of a pound of brisket I got an unsmiling, have-it-our-way reply: \u201cYou can get a pound or a half-pound.\u201d\n        \n\n         With digital scales in use, why?\n        \n\n         Half a pound at a time, it became clear that Mr. Mangum\u2019s scope has widened well beyond brisket. The only disappointment is the chicken, no better or worse than what a skilled weekend cook can produce with a kettle grill. And while there is nothing wrong with a smoked hot sausage, the one here isn\u2019t quite strong enough to build a meal around.\n        \n\n         With its cuts of pork and beef, though, Mighty Quinn\u2019s gets serious, smoking more cuts of meat more skillfully than its rivals, except, perhaps,\n         \n          Daisy May\u2019s\n         \n         , which unfortunately obscures its handiwork in sticky sauces.\n        \n\n         The pulled pork is the only one in town that doesn\u2019t make you embarrassed for New York. It is staggeringly good. The inside meat is slick with the flavor of old-school pork butt; the black, chewy outer rind looks as if it fell into the fire. Don\u2019t be fooled, though; the flavor of smoke and sweet fat is most concentrated there.\n        \n\n         The carvers splash the pulled pork with the house barbecue sauce, which balances sugar with vinegar and mustard; Mr. Mangum calls it Texalina because it blends the styles of\n         \n\n\n          Texas\n         \n         and\n         \n\n\n          North Carolina\n         \n         . It comes close to being an all-purpose condiment, but the rich butt would still benefit from a more bracingly acidic treatment.\n        \n\n         Spare ribs are exceptional, too, meaty and juicy, with a smoky outer ring the color of cherry soda. They are brushed with a little paprika to enhance the oak, cherry and apple smoke they picked up over many hours in a pit made in Mesquite, Tex.\n        \n\n         The beef rib is an instant conversation stopper, a long block of impressively tender meat clinging to a Jurassic curve of bone. It surely upstages the brisket in theatricality, and possibly in flavor as well, though it\u2019s a close call. The brisket is cooked patiently to render much of the fat from the top cap, moistening even the leaner lower muscle until it gleams. A simple rub of salt and pepper is subdued but effective. The meat is not as thoroughly suffused with smoke as the best products of Texas, but it has as much finesse as anything I have ever eaten from a cardboard box.\n        \n\n         The carvers sprinkle the barbecue at Mighty Quinn\u2019s with Maldon salt. This is nice, but it would be even nicer if the restaurant put salt and pepper, or better still a salt-pepper blend, on the table, alongside the brown-glass bottles of that sauce.\n        \n\n         In some barbecue joints in the South, the awfulness of the side dishes is a point of pride. New York, still struggling to be taken seriously, tries harder. Mighty Quinn\u2019s baked beans, darkened with molasses, roughed up with mustard and choked with bacon, may be the best I\u2019ve tasted. If your timing is lucky, you will place your order just as a carver is sweeping a handful of fresh brisket trimmings from the butcher block into the pan.\n        \n\n         There is a salad of peas and edamame coated with goat cheese that people seem to like, although it\u2019s a little out of place here. Perfectly at home, though, is the sweet potato casserole, which is like a pie without a crust. Actually, with its topping of pecans in brown sugar, it is more like two pies, and is as close as Mighty Quinn\u2019s comes to serving dessert.\n        \n\n         The natural enemy of well-smoked barbecue in New York is, of course, New Yorkers. The ones who work for the city can shut down a pit at a moment\u2019s notice if they decide the smoke has not been thoroughly scrubbed and filtered, citing concerns about air quality.\n        \n\n         Some of us believe that the aromas of brisket and ribs improve air quality, but rules are rules. The cost of a flue that satisfies the government, Mr. Mangum said, can run from $10,000 to $15,000 for each floor. Mighty Quinn\u2019s is in a six-story building. Hill Country\u2019s flue is 11 stories high and Blue Smoke\u2019s is 15 stories.\n        \n\n         Doing the math, many pitmasters are now planting their smokestacks on the low rooftops across the East River. Fletcher\u2019s opened in November on an unphotogenic strip of Third Avenue in Gowanus that, against all odds, has become something of a restaurant row.\n        \n\n         The sides made the strongest case for Fletcher\u2019s, like the beans that lap up wood smoke as they bake in the pit next to the meats; the crisp house-made refrigerator pickles, put up in a jar; and the macaroni and cheese when it is topped with the great burnt-end chili.\n        \n\n         Although the meats are all well seasoned and admirably smoky, nearly everything I tried in two visits tended toward dryness in one degree or another. This was more pronounced in the brisket and burnt ends than in the ribs, which were still juicy and pink. Sauces helped lubricate the thinly sliced pork steaks, like the char siu steak, with its Chinatown seasonings.\n        \n\n         As the cooks learn the idiosyncrasies of their J & R smoker, Fletcher\u2019s meats may come closer to an ideal balance. Pitmasters are nothing if not obsessed, losing sleep to tend their fires, adjusting to each day\u2019s temperature and humidity.\n        \n\n         The most obsessed pitmaster in New York may well be\n         \n          Daniel Delaney\n         \n         , who hitched a cast-iron offset smoker to the back of a U-Haul truck in Texas and drove it to Brooklyn. Before he opened BrisketTown in November, he sold brisket by subscription. He did his research, and sells slabs of cheese, like a lightly crunchy and caramelized Comt\u00e9, in homage to the days when barbecue purveyors doubled as grocers (although he is surely the first pitmaster in history to utter the words, \u201cWe\u2019ve started working with Bedford Cheese to curate our cheese program\u201d).\n        \n\n         The most atmospheric of the three restaurants, BrisketTown gets the props right: the neon steer over the butcher block; the paper towel rolls used as an element of d\u00e9cor. You could almost believe you were in Texas if the customers weren\u2019t all as skinny as drainpipes.\n        \n\n         Mr. Delaney pushes cooking time and seasoning to extremes. He rubs the brisket generously with salt and cracked peppercorns and smokes it for many, many hours, until it is very, very tender. The style has its fans, who line up before the doors open at 6:30 and keep coming until the brisket sells out, as it almost always does.\n        \n\n         But I was a skeptic. Long cooking had made the meat too soft; the fatty brisket one night had so little structure I could have eaten it with a spoon. And the edges were so peppery, that\u2019s all I tasted; when I got to the milder interior, my mouth was almost numb. The spare ribs, rubbed less lavishly, were more satisfying.\n        \n\n         Recently I started a fantasy barbecue league. Now I\u2019m building my dream New York City barbecue restaurant with elements from all over town. I\u2019ve got the soundtrack and the corn pudding from\n         \n          Hill Country\n         \n         ; the pickles and chili mac from Fletcher\u2019s; the pork belly and beers from\n         \n          Fette Sau\n         \n         ; the beans, pulled pork, brisket and both kinds of ribs from Mighty Quinn\u2019s; the enthusiasm, atmosphere and cheese from BrisketTown.\n        \n\n         I like our chances this year.\n        \n\n\n          Fletcher\u2019s Brooklyn Barbecue, open Wednesday to Monday for lunch and dinner, 433 Third Avenue (Sixth Street), Gowanus, Brooklyn; (347) 763-2680;\n          \n           fletchersbklyn.com\n          \n          .\n         \n\n\n\n          BrisketTown, open daily for dinner, 359 Bedford Avenue (South Fifth Street), Williamsburg, Brooklyn; (718) 701-8909;\n          \n           delaneybbq.com\n          \n          .\n         \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 99, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-mighty-quinns-barbeque-in-the-east-village.html", "google_mag": 38.29999923706055}, {"review_text": "\n\n             The Pool\n            \n            is such an exceptional restaurant that customers may suspect there\u2019s something wrong with them when they walk out feeling that something was missing. But they\u2019re right. Eating there is like dating somebody who looks great, gives you presents, takes you on trips and tries to convince you that you\u2019re happy until the day you find out that the gifts and plane tickets were charged to your credit card.\n           \n\n            Much of this restaurant\u2019s appeal, as well as some of its problems, come from its architecture. The Pool is one half of the\n            \n             old Four Seasons restaurant\n            \n            in Midtown, the part on the north side of the Seagram Building with a square marble pool in the center. The other end is now\n            \n             the Grill\n            \n            , which I\n            \n             reviewed in August\n            \n            .\n            \n             Philip Johnson\n            \n            designed the whole thing with richly detailed, rigorously geometric understatement that earned it status as one of the few interiors in the city\n            \n             protected by landmark designation\n            \n            .\n           \n\n\n             Major Food Group\n            \n            , the company that runs the Grill and the Pool, took its cues from Johnson to give the two restaurants contrasting styles. The Grill, with its imposing walnut paneling, has a meat-focused menu with midcentury roots that is overseen by Mario Carbone. The Pool, under the hand of Rich Torrisi, serves seafood with a contemporary outlook.\n           \n\n            Crucially, Major Food Group and the building\u2019s owner decided that each restaurant deserved its own bar with its own style. The Grill already had one. For the Pool, which didn\u2019t, they requisitioned, redecorated, refurnished and renamed the mezzanine.\n           \n\n\n             The new Pool Lounge\n            \n            , I discovered by making a phone call, was built without the permits from the Landmarks Preservation Commission that the law requires. In September, the commission summoned the building\u2019s owner, RFR Holding, for a public hearing.\n           \n\n            An application has been belatedly filed to cover three major installations made without approval: the bar and the wall coverings of woven cotton, wool and silver threads in the lounge and the reception desk in the lobby off East 52nd Street. (Sheldon Werdiger, director of marketing and design development at RFR Holding, said in a statement that because furniture is not covered in the landmark designation, \u201cwe thought a new reception desk and bar in the lounge were additive fixtures to the space that can be easily removed and did not require LPC oversight.\u201d)\n           \n\n            But you don\u2019t need to be an architectural historian to see that none of them are remotely in the International Style. The large, inelegant reception desk belongs in an airport; you half expect to be asked if you\u2019re checking any luggage. But the more serious rupture is the Pool Lounge. Although the building\u2019s owner has argued that the Four Seasons used the mezzanine for private events and storage, it was open and in use for restaurant seating every time I ate in the old Pool Room. The tables up there, with their views of the lower dining room and the pool itself, were among the best in the house.\n           \n\n            Now the mezzanine looks as if it had been moved on a trailer from some other building and attached with thumbtacks. Its blue color scheme and rounded, Deco-inspired furniture fight with what is left of Johnson\u2019s right angles and natural tones. When the lounge is full, it\u2019s a distraction. When it\u2019s half-empty, as it often seems to be, it looms like a stage set waiting for the actors to show up. Either way, it sucks energy from the restaurant, which needs all it can get.\n           \n\n            The Landmarks Preservation Commission is waiting for a response from the landlord before ruling on the new fixtures. One change that it is not challenging is the removal of the large planters from the four corners of the pool. When\n            \n             the Four Seasons opened in 1959\n            \n            , these held trees that were changed whenever a new spring, summer, fall or winter rolled around. The trees broke up the sight lines, so you never saw the entire space at once. Now you look around at an uninterrupted sea of heads.\n           \n\n            Messing with the subtle dynamics that Johnson set in motion puts pressure on the cooking and the dining room staff to animate the room. They don\u2019t completely succeed right now.\n           \n\n            The Pool\u2019s problems don\u2019t include the ingredients, which are spectacular. The sweetness of chilled spot prawns under a few drops of olive oil made me shiver with pleasure. A trio of flash-seared Hokkaido sea scallop, Pacific mackerel whose skin had been peppered and griddled, and raw amberjack under tiny cells of finger lime suggested that Mr. Torrisi could run a stunning sushi restaurant.\n           \n\n            My eyes rolled back in my head whenever I ate sea urchin. In one appetizer, it is arranged on griddled pretzel bread with mustard oil and tiny cubes of green apple. In another, lobes of it are layered into an iced bowl to be eaten, with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and chives if you like, over blini, hard-cooked eggs, toast or, my favorites, creamy potato halves roasted in duck fat. (Caviar and trout roe are served the same way.)\n           \n\n            Mr. Torrisi\u2019s approach is to be lavish with punctiliously cared-for seafood and to outfit it sparingly. A beautiful illustration is the cured king salmon, two long, intensely flavorful strips served with a single potato dressed with mustard, shallots and dill. Another is any of the whole fish. The skin on turbot caught in Portugal is seared to a satisfying crackle on a plancha and served with a simple lemon vinaigrette. Like the Dover sole, it is lifted from its skeleton by a slim captain (they\u2019re all slim) who performs the surgery wearing a Tom Ford suit.\n           \n\n            One night five captains in five suits filleted five sole for five diners at a table next to mine. It looked like a scene from\n            \n             \u201cOcean\u2019s Eleven\u201d\n            \n            that didn\u2019t make the final cut.\n           \n\n            But some of the more elaborate dishes are underwhelming. I don\u2019t know how striped bass with banana peppers and \u201cmole spices\u201d can be dull, but it is. Coconut-orange vinaigrette sounds like a terrific sauce for lobster, but it added very little except sweetness, which the lobster didn\u2019t need. Chopped gazpacho ingredients over a puddle of actual gazpacho was both too complicated (why not just serve gazpacho?) and too plain (the cucumbers and tomatoes didn\u2019t shine with flavor).\n           \n\n            This is all a huge improvement on what prevailed in the last years of the Four Seasons. But it doesn\u2019t make you feel as if you are in the hands of one of the city\u2019s best chefs, which Mr. Torrisi is, I think. Even at its best, the food rarely rises to the technical brilliance or boldness of, say, the\n            \n             green curry mushroom mille-feuille\n            \n            or the Vietnamese-flavored chicken legs he put on the menu at\n            \n             Dirty French\n            \n            . If his cooking at the Pool had some of that swagger, what\u2019s on the plates could live up to the best parts of the original architecture and help make up for the renovation\u2019s mistakes.\n           \n\n            This is exactly what happens when Stephanie Prida\u2019s desserts arrive. Ms. Prida, who until a few months ago was the pastry chef at\n            \n             Manresa\n            \n            in Los Gatos, Calif., has a knack for combining flavors that seem to get more interesting as you go along, like a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e with shaved plums and bitter almond ice cream under a squiggle of reduced sherry vinegar, or coconut parfait and fluffy pink-grapefruit mousse sandwiched between the thinnest possible layers of matcha sabl\u00e9.\n           \n\n            Bottles of Chateau d\u2019Yquem going back to 1811 are kept in a glass wine room just off the entrance to the Pool, where they cast a beautiful amber glow that the servers are fond of pointing out. Enjoy it as you walk in, because this is as close as you will get to a dessert wine of any kind unless you are ready to spend at least $95, the price of the least expensive glass.\n           \n\n            The wine list is full of wonderful bottles, but its most noteworthy feature is its breezy lack of concern for normal budgets. Out of dozens of sparkling wines, more than 30 are priced above $1,000. Just one is under $90. This is quite a pinch to put on customers who are already paying between $39 and $74 for main courses.\n           \n\n            The Grill/Pool bifurcation extends to the dining room staff. In the Pool they are reserved, poised, deferential and seem to have been directed not to show any warmth or wit. Compared with the talkative, jokey characters in the Grill, who are ready to flamb\u00e9 something at the drop of a hat, the servers in the Pool are cardboard figures in tailored suits.\n           \n\n            Major Food Group has no fear of going over the top. So I\u2019m reluctant to suggest that the Pool needs more personality and drama \u2014 these guys are capable of stocking the pool with live sharks if they thought it would help. But the restaurant needs something, because at these prices, what might pass for restraint and simplicity can start to seem like a sophisticated heist.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 101, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/dining/the-pool-review.html", "google_mag": 36.099998474121094}, {"review_text": "\n         If we have a shred of sanity left, those of us who never stop thinking about what we\u2019re eating have to wish that once in a while we could turn back the clock. We start to miss the days when you could go out to dinner without all the food talk: the \u201chave you been there yet?\u201d interrogations, the name-dropping of pop-up ramen stands and celebrity milkweed foragers, the tableside decipherings of what is on your plate, moving counterclockwise from the cod milt gelatin resting in a pickled starling\u2019s nest.\n        \n\n         A yearning for simpler times may explain the Beatrice Inn in the West Village, which has been packed to its low rafters since it opened in November. Graydon Carter said that he and his partners in the restaurant, Emil Varda and Brett Rasinski, wanted it to be \u201ca classic chophouse,\u201d a term so dusty that one of the city\u2019s few remaining chophouses, Keens, now calls itself a steakhouse.\n        \n\n         Everything about the place \u2014 the burnished paneling; the leather banquettes in law-firm green; the men waiting tables in white shirts and black neckties; the short and to-the-point menu of Hillary Sterling, the chef since February \u2014 broadcasts a return to the days when dinner required no explanation. Sorry, Instagrammers, but you will not be posting shots of your steak or salad, because a footnote on the menu reads \u201cPhotography is not permitted.\u201d\n        \n\n         It might have added, \u201cPlease refrain from talking about your food,\u201d but there\u2019s little danger of that.\n        \n\n         After eating squishy goat-cheese gnudi that were bursting with the flavor of warm New York City tap water and were buried under slices of prosciutto almost too thick to cut with a fork, only one remark came to mind: \u201cHow\u2019s your steak?\u201d\n        \n\n         The steak was no conversation piece itself. A New York strip, it had a chewy band of fat at its edge, as if the meat were wearing a protective latex sheath, and the meat was shot through with gristle. My dinner companion and I stared and chewed and thought for a long time. Finally, one of us said, \u201cWell, it\n         \n          is\n         \n         medium-rare.\u201d\n        \n\n         There was nothing to say about a stack of carrots that came with a braised and roasted veal breast except that it shouldn\u2019t be possible for vegetables to be both charred and raw. Apparently it is, though, because a steak turned up in the company of blackened and crunchy hen-of-the-woods mushrooms. The desperately undercooked sunchokes with saut\u00e9ed trout were something of a relief. They were awful, but they were not even a little bit burned.\n        \n\n         For dessert there was cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e studded with dried-out apple fragments that might have come from an envelope of instant oatmeal, and an uncreamy scoop of ricotta gelato on a stiff pool of ice-cold honey caramel with chopped walnuts.\n        \n\n         This time words came easily. We asked for the check.\n        \n\n         Other dishes were unremarkable in a more benign way. Flattened chicken with crunchy, golden skin and a kind of dirty-blond gravy was easy enough to eat. Kale dressed with lemons, chiles and fried garlic was better than that, and so was a salad of watercress and other greens with shaved radish. The strip steak on a later visit was juicier and more tender.\n        \n\n         Lamb porterhouse showered with roasted artichoke leaves was very satisfying once I ignored the grainy, salty sauce of dried black olives around it. So were crisp and fresh fried oysters with smoked char roe, as long as I didn\u2019t focus too much on a bitter and blandly sweet citrus pur\u00e9e. A dessert with fresh grapefruit and whipped cream on top of lemon curd was refreshing and soothing.\n        \n\n         But there I go, talking about the food. The thing to do at the Beatrice Inn is to look and listen.\n        \n\n         Two longtime staff members at Vanity Fair, which Mr. Carter has edited since 1992, are huddled at a cozy round table. They nod to me because I used to work as a fact-checker at the magazine, drifting away around 1994.\n        \n\n         \u201cEverybody is obsessed with Jennifer Lawrence,\u201d the man next to me is shouting. Speaking only for myself, I am more interested in Candice Bergen, who left a few minutes ago. And over there is Charlie Rose and his posse. He seems about to doze off, but he looked that way before he started eating.\n        \n\n         Sleep would be challenging. Those ceilings multiply the roar. On the plus side, they make short people look like models and models look like church steeples. Everybody is roughly twice as attractive inside these walls. This might explain why, when the Beatrice Inn was a nightclub known for youthful high jinks, the previous owners had to put up signs reminding patrons that it was not all right to have sex in the bathrooms.\n        \n\n         Mr. Varda and his partners put a stop to all that. The drug of choice at the Beatrice Inn is now wine, most of it rather expensive, served with laconic grace by Aaron Zebrook. One night he recommended a pinot noir that took me over some rough patches in my meal, and he also led me to a bottle I drank during the one good dinner I had at the Beatrice Inn.\n        \n\n         This was back in January, when the chef was Brian Nasworthy, previously a sous-chef at Per Se. Mr. Nasworthy\u2019s interpretation of chophouse cuisine was careful, smart and refined, although the desserts were still a punt. His shrimp cocktail played gently poached shrimp against a horseradish-chile gastrique that had the lively hot-sweet-sour-salty tension of a Southeast Asian sauce. He baked oyster mushrooms, salsify and spinach under a textbook hollandaise for a clever take on oysters Rockefeller. It was meant to be a sideshow to an over-the-top-rich Wagyu rib-eye for $150, but came close to upstaging it.\n        \n\n         Mr. Nasworthy was dismissed a few weeks later and is now the chef de cuisine at Picholine. Mr. Varda praised his talent but said, \u201chis culinary philosophy did not agree with ours.\u201d\n        \n\n         Evidently not. The four of us at the table that night had talked about the food on the way home.\n        \n\n\n          The Beatrice Inn\n         \n\n\n         Satisfactory\n        \n\n         285 West 12th Street (West Fourth Street), (917) 566-7400, Greenwich Village\n        \n\n\n          ATMOSPHERE\n         \n         Like a William Hamilton cartoon of a private club, but with younger men, and women, too.\n        \n\n\n          SERVICE\n         \n         Kind, but not particularly familiar with what the kitchen is up to.\n        \n\n\n          SOUND LEVEL\n         \n         Debilitating.\n        \n\n\n          RECOMMENDED\n         \n         Greens; crispy oysters; roasted chicken; citrus cream.\n        \n\n\n          DRINKS AND WINE\n         \n         Cocktails are rejuvenated classics; wines are impressive but expensive, with a few exceptions.\n        \n\n\n          PRICES\n         \n         Appetizers, $14 to $17; main courses, $25 to $45.\n        \n\n\n          OPEN\n         \n         Dinner nightly.\n        \n\n\n          RESERVATIONS\n         \n         Accepted by phone, text or e-mail:\n         \n          Beatrice@thebeatriceinn.com\n         \n         .\n        \n\n\n          WHEELCHAIR ACCESS\n         \n         Not accessible.\n        \n\n\n          WHAT THE STARS MEAN\n         \n         Ratings range from zero to four stars and reflect the reviewer\u2019s reaction primarily to food, with ambience, service and price taken into consideration.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 102, "rating": "Satisfactory", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/22/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-the-beatrice-inn-in-the-west-village.html", "google_mag": 26.0}, {"review_text": "\n         IN HIS LANDMARK STUDY FROM 1971, \u201cThe Food of Italy,\u201d Waverley Root divided that nation into 19 distinct culinary regions. The book is a classic, its insights and prose recipes still tantalizing four decades later, but it contains a major oversight. Mr. Root says nothing at all about the Italian Upper East Side.\n        \n\n         In this chunk of the earth that broke off from the boot and drifted 4,300 miles across the ocean before colliding with Manhattan, the restaurant menus resemble one another more than they do the menus of Emilia-Romagna, Campania or Umbria. Ligurian pesto, Tuscan steak, Roman pasta all\u2019amatriciana and Sicilian cannoli live together in harmony. Salad is an antipasto, truffles never go out of season, and beets with goat cheese is a combination as time-honored as tomatoes and olive oil.\n        \n\n         Caravaggio, which opened in 2009 around the corner from the Whitney Museum of American Art, makes a strong bid to win respect in its wayward region. Owned by Giuseppe, Antonio, Cosimo and Geraldo Bruno, the four brothers who also run Sistina and San Pietro not far away, it is one of the most civilized Italian restaurants to turn up anywhere in the city in the last few years.\n        \n\n         Plumes of fresh flowers (cherry blossoms in early April, calla lilies later in the month) line one side of the hallway to the dining room; on the other is a framed print by \u2014 oh, hello, signed Matisse lithograph. Inside are more flowers, and much more art: a pair of Ellsworth Kelly prints, a pair of Frank Stella paintings, all four bought from the widow of William Rubin, the former curator of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art.\n        \n\n         On a commission from the Brunos, the painter Donald Baechler has covered the entire back wall with a crowd of the eeriest children in the world. With their terrified eyes and gaping red mouths, they look as if they might be friends of Dick and Jane\u2019s who have just watched Spot eat Puff. The mural is unsettling, but it has the hovering, electric presence of real art.\n        \n\n         Caravaggio is defiantly elegant in an age that sees white tablecloths as a medieval relic whose sadistic power to stand in the way of a good time is second only to that of the chastity belt. The tables are draped with linens, ceiling baffles keep the noise to a low burble, and streamlined chocolate-leather chairs offer a quaint amenity known as lumbar support.\n        \n\n         Another anachronism: a dress code. Jeans, shorts and sneakers are not permitted, the Web site says, although in practice only the ban on shorts is enforced. Jackets and ties are not required, but nearly all the men wear them, along with haircuts that seem to have been tidied up at Paul Mol\u00e9 a day or two ago. The women seem to have had their hair done even more recently. Caravaggio\u2019s loyalists are so well groomed, it is humbling. \u201cWe are among our betters,\u201d a companion said one night.\n        \n\n         The plates are just as carefully put together, assembled with a sharp eye for color and shape. Caravaggio has a roasted swordfish that is an Italian flag in seafood form, the white fillet sitting between a red pond of pur\u00e9ed tomato sauce and a frothy green sea of oregano sauce. And it served me one of the prettiest veal chops I\u2019ve ever seen, trimmed into a thick, nearly perfect circle and evenly, handsomely browned.\n        \n\n         Osso buco with saffron risotto, which may be the official dish of the Italian Upper East Side, looked better than ever and was almost ideally cooked, the meat tender and rose-tinted, the rice firm and creamy.\n        \n\n         But Caravaggio, for all its civility, is haunted by inconsistency more than three years into its run. Some of my meals there were very good; in others, I couldn\u2019t find a single dish to get excited about, and there were a few that were just not right at all.\n        \n\n         The same kitchen that dressed perfectly al dente spaghetti with a wonderfully balanced pesto of dried nuts and tomatoes put too many tomatoes in a Sicilian sardine and fennel sauce and tossed the result with bucatini that were crunchy and hard at one end. Dover sole was cooked to show off the firm delicacy that makes it such a treat, but the swordfish wrapped in the Italian flag should have come out of the oven at least two minutes sooner.\n        \n\n         Scallops, shrimp and tiny squid rings were sweet and tender, and while serving them warm over braised leeks with a lobster reduction may have stretched the definition of a seafood salad, it was so good nobody would ever complain. But in another appetizer, octopus tentacles had no flavor at all; they were nothingness with suction cups.\n        \n\n         Caravaggio\u2019s bomboloni, sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and served hot in a figure-8 dish with vanilla sauce and caramel, were light enough to achieve liftoff. But the floury, dry torta di ricotta remained depressingly earthbound.\n        \n\n         First-time travelers should be warned: no matter what the euro is trading at, the exchange rate on the Italian Upper East Side is always awful. It is especially unfavorable at Caravaggio, where salads begin at $18, and most of the pastas hover around $25. This ought to be enough to buy bucatini that is cooked on both ends.\n        \n\n         Service, slightly formal but relaxed enough to crack a smile, often lived up to Caravaggio\u2019s aspirations. But there could be unscheduled leaves of absence after main courses were cleared, and one night one server after another tried to take our order before anyone had told us about the specials. When someone finally did, the recitation went on for almost five minutes, covering at least a dozen dishes.\n        \n\n         It felt like a memory quiz, one I always flunked until I started writing the correct answer on my palm: just get the chicken meatballs. They are made from white meat mixed with capers, sun-dried tomatoes, thyme and enough milk-soaked bread to give them some loft, and they are braised in tomato sauce, but none of this quite accounts for their appeal.\n        \n\n         The appeal of fickle and expensive Caravaggio is easier to explain. For great Italian cooking, much of the action is in thunderous and flashy downtown dining rooms. The civilized style of a place like Caravaggio feels as rare and impressive as a blue whale. That would draw me back, along with the chicken meatballs, the bomboloni, those spooky kids and the chance that one day the restaurant will put the Italian Upper East Side on the map.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 103, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-caravaggio-on-the-italian-upper-east-side.html", "google_mag": 20.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n         Your job may be worrying you, or your father\u2019s health, or your own. You may have been up at 2 that morning drafting a better ending for a long-ago memory. But certain restaurants, if you can afford them, can knock down the barriers between you and happiness for a few hours. Every taste seems to transport you to another world, while every gesture of the staff convinces you that you live in the privileged center of this one.\n        \n\n\n          Daniel\n         \n         , which turned 20 this year, can make you feel that way. Does chilled pea soup sound like the stuff of privilege? It is when it comes from this kitchen, where\n         \n          Jean Fran\u00e7ois Bruel\n         \n         has been the executive chef since 2003, and which\n         \n\n\n          Daniel Boulud\n         \n         , the proprietor, watches over from a windowed perch above the saucepans and sieves.\n        \n\n         Those sieves got a workout on this soup, straining it to a gliding smoothness. It had the clear, refreshing sweetness of the smallest peas eaten straight from the pod. Salty diamonds of smoked sable and a white ring of rosemary-infused cream helped the soup\u2019s purity shine more clearly. This kind of exquisitely sensitive, profoundly seasonal, fundamentally French cooking helped lift Daniel to several four-star reviews in\n         \n\n\n          The New York Times\n         \n         ,\n         \n          the most recent one\n         \n         by Frank Bruni in 2009.\n        \n\n         Again and again, I have been startled by the excellence of Mr. Bruel\u2019s ingredients and his talent for unlocking all they had to offer. I have never tasted more calmly flavorful veal tenderloin, or fresher and more gently handled swordfish, or a more skillfully roasted breast of guinea hen.\n        \n\n         But some of these star ingredients were embedded in elaborate, multipart compositions that didn\u2019t fully reward the attention they demanded. At times, the restaurant gave the impression that it was trying to garnish its way to greatness.\n        \n\n         And while the service can be among the best in the city, with a supreme attentiveness softened by a surprising warmth and even chattiness, it is not always that way for everyone. When people who are known at the restaurant tell me about their meals, they look blissful. Others look disappointed or resentful as they tell me about cramped tables in the neoclassical arcades around the grand sunken dining room and hasty, perfunctory service.\n        \n\n         One night I had a reservation 15 minutes apart from a colleague who wasn\u2019t likely to be recognized, as I repeatedly was. We both ordered the six-course $195 tasting menu. (A three-course prix fixe dinner is $116.) Our meals were virtually identical. Our experiences were not.\n        \n\n         The kitchen sent two amuse courses to my table. His got one. A few remaining sips of my wine, ordered by the glass, were topped off. His glass sat empty at times while he waited to be offered another.\n        \n\n         We both ate extraordinary fried lollipops of filleted frogs\u2019 legs on a long stick of bone, but only I was then brought a napkin-covered bowl of rosemary- and lemon-scented water for rinsing my fingers.\n        \n\n         My servers were solicitous: Was this course, or that one, or that one, prepared to your liking? Was the pacing of the meal satisfactory? Could we interest you in a cheese course? Would you like your espresso with dessert, or after? Finally, as I neared the revolving door on East 65th Street: Can we help you find a cab tonight?\n        \n\n         My colleague wasn\u2019t asked any of those questions. Still, the next morning, he reported feeling very well taken care of. And a restaurant can\u2019t be blamed for trying to impress a critic.\n        \n\n         It can be faulted, though, for turning its best face away from the unknowns, the first-timers, the birthday splurgers, the tourists. They are precisely the people who would remember a little coddling at a place like Daniel for years.\n        \n\n         And while a missing finger bowl won\u2019t seriously mar anyone\u2019s evening, missing Daniel\u2019s cheese cart might. It is one of the finest four-wheeled vehicles in New York. Whenever I wondered if I really wanted cheese, a server would lay his knife on a soft wheel, pressing gently. The mounded top would fall for a moment then rise up again, gracefully and almost willingly. After that, the question was not if I should have some, but how many kinds could fit on one plate.\n        \n\n         It was just as pointless to try to wave away the basket of Mark Fiorentino\u2019s gorgeous breads, like a garlic focaccia, round and dimpled in the center. Rajeev Vaidya, the head sommelier, shepherded me past the many bottles that could land a weak wine lover in debt to more affordable ones. He has a 2007 halbtrocken from the German riesling maker Georg Breuer. Some buyers scoffed at the vintage, pushing prices down, but not Mr. Vaidya. A bottle can be yours for the princely sum of $25.\n        \n\n         Recently, the title of executive pastry chef passed from Sandro Micheli to Ghaya Oliveira, and the dessert course, already exciting, has a little more energy. Ms. Oliveira\u2019s approach is more modern and wide-ranging, embracing unusual spices and exuberant swipes of color. Her mint-scented strawberries are a giddy, flagrant essay in pink, with triangles of watermelon, columns of half-frozen strawberry mousse and ladyfingers tinted with powdered strawberry skin. It was a soft, lilting summer tune I won\u2019t get out of my head before Labor Day.\n        \n\n         The courses before dessert could be just as wonderfully haunting. I\u2019d give a lot to recapture the happiness I got from slow-baked abalone, rich with creamed avocado and slightly tart with heart-shaped wood sorrel. I\u2019m still transfixed by a peekytoe crab salad\u2019s bravura variations on apple and celery, carried through to the juices in a walnut-oil vinaigrette.\n        \n\n         And nothing quite prepared me for the untamed whoosh of intense green herbs in a bowl of olive-oil-poached cod teased into big, glistening flakes, then seasoned with za\u2019atar and a bright cilantro sauce.\n        \n\n         But the kitchen\u2019s compulsion toward complexity could also result in a proliferation of dollhouse garnishes. Grilled sweet shrimp were outfitted with a heart of palm pur\u00e9e, microcubes of mango and cucumber, bok choy, tiny tapioca crackers, curls of shaved hearts of palm, among other things. The parts never quite gathered into a rush of flavor.\n        \n\n         A variation on Mr. Boulud\u2019s classic roasted sea bass with syrah sauce came with radicchio so bitter I wanted to slap it. A drum of sweet potato pur\u00e9e with a candylike crust of marrow on top only made the next bite of radicchio harder to take.\n        \n\n         The kitchen loves to put two or three treatments of an ingredient side by side, when it might do better to focus on the one that works best. In a triptych of striped jack, a poached piece on a salad of mustard seeds with cubes of riesling gel\u00e9e tasted as if the components were destined to be together. But there wasn\u2019t the same inevitability about the lettuce-wrapped dumpling of striped jack tartare topped with caviar, or the smoky rillettes surrounded by crunchy carrot and asparagus.\n        \n\n         Daniel built its fame on Mr. Boulud\u2019s exquisite refinements on French peasant food. Over the years, the refinements have multiplied while the peasant food has been sent away to his many spinoff bistros.\n        \n\n         Traces of it are still around, as in the short rib braised in red wine, half of a beef duo. The last time I tasted it, I was sure it was the finest French beef stew in existence. I knew my servers were trying to make my night one I\u2019d recall with a smile. And I wished everyone could be so lucky.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 104, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/24/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-daniel-on-the-upper-east-side.html", "google_mag": 31.899999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n            All the things I love about the pancakes at\n            \n             Chez Ma Tante\n            \n            , near the Greenpoint waterfront in Brooklyn, are things that normal chefs would try to fix. They are a little too tall and too big around. The outside is nearly black in parts, and crunchy, which American pancakes almost never are.\n           \n\n            What they most closely resemble are the pancakes I\u2019ve made on camping trips, from a mix, with about a quarter-stick of melted butter in a smoking-hot pan over a fire. Each one is the size of Frisbee because too many people are waiting for breakfast for any space in the pan to be wasted.\n           \n\n            Assuming my campfire pancakes were to catch a chef\u2019s eye, the standard way of turning them into a brunch dish would be to refine them. The heat would come down so they\u2019d cook to an even golden-brown. My quantity of butter would seem insane in a professional kitchen, so it would be cut. The batter would probably be thinned to make the pancakes shorter and more elegantly rounded.\n           \n\n            Rounding out the rough edges is, in a broad sense, one of the main things chefs do. They may not always do it consciously, any more than a copy editor consciously corrects typos. It\u2019s supposed to become a reflex, which is the point of the sign on the kitchen wall at\n            \n             Eleven Madison Park\n            \n            : MAKE IT NICE.\n           \n\n            This is just what the chef Aidan O\u2019Neal at Chez Ma Tante does not do to the pancakes. Rising up from a small flood of maple syrup, they look and taste as if they\u2019d been made in the woods. I will gladly admit they\u2019re better than mine. At weekend brunch, they are on virtually every table.\n           \n\n            Mr. O\u2019Neal and his chef de cuisine, Jake Leiber, do not lack skill in the kitchen, but they know when to resist cheflike impulses and think like hungry campers. Their healthy disregard for refinement spills over to the dinner menu, which recently expanded to seven nights a week from five, just as the restaurant is approaching its first birthday.\n           \n\n            To start, you might smear a gob of chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 on a tangy slice of miche charred over the grill, or some head cheese, a spreadable pink composite of meat not quite held together by drippy pork goo. The most rustic thing you can eat there at night, though, has to be the thick steak carved out of a pork shoulder, rubbed with mustard and maple syrup, and striped with wide, dark grill marks. Smeared over the top is a salsa verde made from fresh parsley and other herbs that were whole about three or four slashes of a knife ago. Stewed Puy lentils spill across the rest of the plate. The look may say it was thrown together, but the full, lasting flavors tell you it wasn\u2019t.\n           \n\n            It is hard to say exactly what kind of food Chez Ma Tante serves, apart from the consistently good kind. The website calls it \u201cfood that can only be described as European.\u201d This isn\u2019t particularly helpful or specific; I\u2019ve never eaten anything there that seemed Finnish, say, or Bulgarian.\n           \n\n            If the menu has a theme, you won\u2019t guess it from the dining room. A collection of brown chairs and black tables on a black floor in an undecorated white room, it is as austere as a Shaker chapel, although one with a long, well-populated bar against the wall.\n           \n\n            No hints are forthcoming from the cocktail list, either, which plays it close to the vest with daiquiris, Negronis, Cosmopolitans and so on. It is the first cocktail list I\u2019ve seen in a long time on which I recognized every drink.\n           \n\n            Other writers have described Chez Ma Tante as a neighborhood spot, a homage to certain well-known London restaurants, a gastro pub and a \u201cFrench-Canadian bistro.\u201d This last must be a reference to Mr. O\u2019Neal. Raised in Vancouver, British Columbia, he cooked at\n            \n             Au Pied de Cochon\n            \n            in Montreal under Martin Picard, the grinning scoutmaster of the hungry-camper troop, before moving to New York to work at the berserk Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois outpost M. Wells, in Long Island City, Queens. (He met Mr. Leiber a few years later when they worked together at\n            \n             Caf\u00e9 Altro Paradiso\n            \n            in SoHo.)\n           \n\n            The name Chez Ma Tante was borrowed from a stainless-steel slot of a place in Montreal known for its steam\u00e9, a steamed hot dog in a steamed bun. An \u201call dressed\u201d steam\u00e9, meaning it\u2019s loaded up with mustard and coleslaw, is a new feature on the brunch menu in Greenpoint. Apart from that and a recurring maple motif \u2014 the jugs of syrup on a shelf outside the kitchen are not just for show \u2014 the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois influence is minimal.\n           \n\n            A minor British theme seems undeniable. First off, the French fries are unmistakably English chips: twice-fried wedges that are steamy and starchy on the inside. If I were from England myself, I\u2019d probably call them \u201cproper chips,\u201d even though they come with a little cup of aioli on the side.\n           \n\n            Whether Chez Ma Tante\u2019s kedgeree is a proper kedgeree I don\u2019t know. It is, essentially, white rice dyed yellow with curry powder and mixed with hard-cooked egg and flaked cod. A fair amount of butter seems to be involved. On top is a crunchy salad of celery stalks and leaves. Somehow it\u2019s rich and refreshing and soothing and exciting at the same time.\n           \n\n            How did falafel, fried to a crackle and served over hummus and harissa with pickle wheels, get here? Not sure, but it is a great improvement over most of the vegetarian options you meet around town.\n           \n\n            Salads, too, are better than usual: shavings of kohlrabi and apples imbued with lemon; roasted almonds and raisins over white shreds of stracciatella cheese; a Caesar whose romaine leaves are small and tender, and whose croutons are closer to fried crumbs.\n           \n\n            The night ends with straightforward bistro desserts. Maple returns one more time in a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e; its torched sugar crust is repeated, in a lighter form, on the surface of a lemon tart wedge; the tarte Tatin is classic, although the caramel one night was a little more bitter than it needed to be.\n           \n\n            Like\n            \n             King\n            \n            in SoHo, which could be this restaurant\u2019s older sister after a junior year abroad, Chez Ma Tante offers sorbet with a shot of vodka meant to be poured over the top. Because this is Greenpoint, the vodka is Polish. Presumably for the same reason, most customers don\u2019t bother pouring it over the sorbet; they just toss it back in one gulp.\n           \n\n\n             Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n            \n            ,\n            \n             Instagram\n            \n            ,\n            \n             Twitter\n            \n            and\n            \n             Pinterest\n            \n            .\n            \n             Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n            \n            .\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 105, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/dining/chez-ma-tante-review-brookyn.html", "google_mag": 27.299999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n         The outside makes no grand statements. A glass wall stares out at a not-yet-trendy block of Orchard Street. It\u2019s blank except for the small menu posted by the door, offering five courses for the relatively modest sum of $55. Hanging on one inside wall, more art than ad, and almost invisible unless you are walking southbound very close to the window, is the restaurant\u2019s name in red neon script:\n         \n          Contra\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         At work in a compact kitchen at the far end of the earnest and narrow dining room are two chefs whose ambitions for Contra are anything but small. They want to create a style of cooking that New York can call its own.\n        \n\n         \u201cThis is an incredible food city, but sometimes you can see a lack of identity in the restaurants here, where people want to channel another place, another time,\u201d Jeremiah Stone, a former sous-chef of\n         \n          Rino in Paris\n         \n         who helped open\n         \n          Isa\n         \n         in New York, told\n         \n          Eater\n         \n         shortly before the restaurant opened in October. \u201cThey want to do modern Thai, Roman, creative French.\u201d\n        \n\n         His partner in the kitchen, Fabian von Hauske, who worked in the pastry kitchen of\n         \n\n\n          Jean Georges\n         \n         and, briefly, at\n         \n          Faviken\n         \n         in\n         \n\n\n          Sweden\n         \n         , pursued the idea. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s that much of a style here,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go to\n         \n\n\n          San Francisco\n         \n         and there is definitely a style there when you go to places like\n         \n          Coi\n         \n         or\n         \n          Commis\n         \n         . I think there should be more of an identity here, something that\u2019s contemporary that you can\u2019t find anywhere else.\u201d\n        \n\n         In most other cities, hatchets would be out for a pair of 20-something chefs who rode into town promising to show everybody how it\u2019s done. But not New York. Here we just say, All right, kids, let\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got.\n        \n\n         What Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske have is a personal, understated, modern approach to deeply seasonal cooking. Mr. von Hauske makes the desserts and the bread, which costs an extra $3 and is worth it for the supremely creamy butter alone. Mr. Stone does the rest, but their styles are compatible. I\u2019m not enthusiastic about what strikes me as a Northern European\n         \n\n\n          phobia\n         \n         of spices, but I came to admire their restraint with salt and added fat. You can see this approach catching on among other young chefs, some of whose food gets lumped in with\n         \n          the New Nordic movement\n         \n         . A more accurate name for their quiet, naturalistic, drama-averse approach may be mumblecore cuisine. Contra, at the moment, pulls it off with an originality that is sometimes dazzling and always worth following.\n        \n\n         The monkfish that appeared one recent night was cooked with faultless timing, roasted slowly, with the kind of tender pink center you\u2019d find inside a seared scallop. It shared its chunky earthenware plate with leaves of charred kale, a marmalade of caramelized onions and a fish-sauce foam, but if you are thinking Vietnamese-molecular fusion, forget it. The fish sauce was a complex and milky froth made of monkfish bones and smoked trout, and it was very, very good.\n        \n\n         This was truly expressive cooking, exploring shades of flavor more watercolor than acrylic. The dish is either changed or gone by now, no doubt, but the impression lasted.\n        \n\n         And I won\u2019t forget Contra\u2019s pairing of chicken breast with pickled daikon, toasted sesame seeds and blood sausage. The sausage had been transformed into a swipe of soft, tangy, beet-red paste, dotted with marjoram leaves and tart nubs of dried raspberries. It all came together in a way so unexpected and right that I had to shake my head.\n        \n\n         New dishes roll onto the tasting menu every few days, and old ones are subject to restless tinkering. (Old, at Contra, means anything that was invented before today.) The first time I ate monkfish there, a mash of raw walnuts and garlic in miso was trying out for the role that was later played, with more depth, by the onion jam. And I liked watching the evolution of a raw scallop dish outfitted with noodle-like ribbons of raw kohlrabi. As wide as seatbelts the first time, they had slimmed down and looked more like fettuccine the next. On the other hand, the dried raspberries had gone from the blood-sausage swoosh the second time I saw the monkfish. I missed them a little.\n        \n\n         You get the luck of the draw at restaurants that offer only tasting menus, but the format suits Contra\u2019s food unusually well. The flavors are subtle, and on first encounter it\u2019s a bit like walking out of the daylight and into a candlelit room: you need to adjust. Five courses is enough time to open your eyes (you may get more time than you need on nights when the pace drags).\n        \n\n         Another advantage of the tasting menu becomes clear when you are served dessert, followed by a second dessert. As you may have guessed, Mr. von Hauske is judicious with sugar and quite comfortable with vegetables. I liked a beets-and-yogurt number more than I did a creamed gianduja studded with tough sunchoke chips that put up more of a fight than I could face at the end of the night.\n        \n\n         But at least I knew everybody else would be crunching along with me, and I\u2019d already smiled my way through a less-antagonistic dessert, a kind of rebuilt apple crisp, with an oat crumble and whipped oat-infused custard around a cider-like apple granita. This dessert was pure fun and charm, like Mr. von Hauske\u2019s partnering of tangerine granita with a smooth popcorn-infused mousse and smashed bits of caramel popcorn.\n        \n\n         Linda Milagros Violago, who stocked the cellars at\n         \n          Mugaritz\n         \n         in\n         \n\n\n          Spain\n         \n         and Geranium in\n         \n\n\n          Denmark\n         \n         , has put together a list of bottles from the kind of small winemakers who think of themselves as farmers and avoid modern tricks. The results aren\u2019t always what you\u2019d predict; a French cider, she said, had a note of blue cheese, and it did. The list almost forces you to try something unfamiliar, which feels just right for this restaurant.\n        \n\n         I hope Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske achieve all their goals except the one about creating a shared New York style. The crazy riot of voices chattering in hundreds of accents is the whole point of this crazy, riotous city they have adopted. We don\u2019t need other chefs imitating Contra\u2019s style. We\u2019ve got the original now.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 108, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/12/dining/restaurant-review-contra-on-the-lower-east-side.html", "google_mag": 25.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n         Another week, another Japanese-Venetian restaurant.\n        \n\n         All\u2019onda is the name, and in truth it\u2019s not quite like any other place, although it\u2019s not as far-out as the elevator pitch makes it sound, either. The space glows with warm invitation to passers-by on East 13th Street, who can see the communal table and bar downstairs and, through second-story windows, the main dining room. Inside, there are no terrifying beasts with Japanese heads grafted onto Italian torsos, no teriyaki calf\u2019s liver or soba pesto.\n        \n\n         There is nothing terrifying at all. Chris Jaeckle\u2019s cooking at All\u2019onda is recognizably and elegantly Italian, and for the most part it\u2019s wonderful stuff. Mr. Jaeckle is a sophisticated chef whose marriage of Ligurian and French-Mediterannean cooking at\n         \n          Ai Fiori\n         \n         , under the guidance of\n         \n\n\n          Michael White\n         \n         , helped the restaurant\n         \n          win three stars\n         \n         from\n         \n\n\n          The New York Times\n         \n         in 2011. At All\u2019onda, he has teamed up with the restaurateur Jeffrey Chodorow.\n        \n\n         The relationship between the two cuisines at All\u2019onda is less a marriage than an infatuation. It\u2019s as if an Italian menu had a raging crush on\n         \n\n\n          Japan\n         \n         and couldn\u2019t stop bringing it up in conversation.\n        \n\n         Most of this is done so smoothly, you hardly notice. Black truffle risotto, slick with Parmesan and butter, would strike you as old school if you didn\u2019t know that Mr. Jaeckle finishes it with the rice mash left over when sake is fermented. The Japanese ingredient adds a rounded, softly fruity flavor that quietly works its way into the risotto. Far more prominent are the flecks of winter truffles, whose aroma, part onion and part animal, goes directly from your nostrils to your brain.\n        \n\n         Long quills of garganelli are tossed with chunks of sweet crab and toasted bread crumbs. It\u2019s all very classic, as is the warm spiciness that lifts up the pasta. But the source of the spice is yuzu kosho, the Japanese condiment fermented from yuzu peel and a weaponized dose of chiles. The way Mr. Jaeckle uses it, though, nearly convinced me that yuzu kosho should be sold at\n         \n          Eataly\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         As usual with crushes, the object of affection occasionally comes up in a context so strained you have to roll your eyes. All\u2019onda\u2019s winning dark chocolate tart grew menacing when it came with a salty scoop of soy gelato. And the most regrettable dish I ate was an ill-advised twist on tortellini in brodo, in which the pasta parcels stuffed with unmelted cheese sat in a gelatinous, lukewarm and indistinct stock made from Parmesan and dashi.\n        \n\n         Other slight misfires can\u2019t be blamed on Japan. The aged-duck rag\u00f9 with bent tubes of pasta called lumache simply needed more depth, as if the soffritto had not been caramelized enough, and the very dark chocolate in the rag\u00f9 and around the rim of the plate didn\u2019t cover the deficit.\n        \n\n         For the most part, though, good sense and good taste prevail. All\u2019onda just opened in early January, and already Mr. Jaeckle has come up with two dishes so appealing that he will have a fight on his hands if he tries to take them off the menu.\n        \n\n         First, there is the bucatini with sea urchin. Sea urchin pasta is so popular now, it will probably turn up on the menu at the Olive Garden before the year is over, but Mr. Jaeckle has done something novel and delicious with it. The urchin is cold-smoked, which makes it something like briny bacon and, when folded into egg yolks, cream and garlic, makes the rest of the dish something like spaghetti carbonara from the deep. The first time I had it, the bucatini were too soft and doughy, but the next time they had the proper snap to offset their creamy sauce.\n        \n\n         And there is the short rib for two. The side dish of saffron risotto calls osso buco to mind, but this is not another brown, sticky braise. It\u2019s cooked sous vide for three days until the meat is glistening pink-red with veins of rich fat inside, then grilled to give it a spicy black crust. It looks like pastrami, and I can\u2019t get it out of my mind.\n        \n\n         As has been widely reported, New York law now requires raw seafood appetizers in all Italian restaurants. The ones here are generally very good, like hamachi in a soy sauce bath with strands of pickled kuri squash and tiny cubes of peperoncini. Among the main courses there is not one that isn\u2019t well thought out, from the skate under a veal glaze to the guinea hen, separated into a roasted breast and confitted leg beneath a naturally sweet pur\u00e9e of parsnips.\n        \n\n         Like many new restaurants, All\u2019onda isn\u2019t strong across the board. Service can be rushed and not exactly polished, and I can\u2019t say the soy gelato was the only disappointing so-called sweet. Affogato is no treat when the espresso tastes charred and the ice cream has big ice crystals. Panna cotta flavored with Fernet-Branca is an oddity that would be easier to bear if it were a palate cleanser before a real dessert arrives. Until All\u2019onda gets the rest of its lineup in shape, the dense and lightly crunchy olive oil cake is your best hope.\n        \n\n         Despite the risks, All\u2019onda is fun and lively enough that I can imagine dropping in once a month or so for a short-rib reunion. This is late-period Chodorow, with the nightclub grandiosity stripped away. The dining room staff looks almost ostentatiously casual \u2014 none more than Chris Cannon. New Yorkers who remember Mr. Cannon in a stiffly knotted necktie standing at attention behind the host stands at\n         \n          Marea\n         \n         ,\n         \n          Convivio\n         \n         ,\n         \n          Alto\n         \n         or Palio won\u2019t recognize him here, where he works as a consultant. He lopes beneath the exposed rafters outfitted in jeans, a plaid shirt, a quilted vest and a backward wool cap. With a dead rabbit or two over his shoulder, he\u2019d look like an Italian winemaker coming back from a hunting trip.\n        \n\n         If he lopes to your table, get him started about wine. He knows who makes the good stuff in\n         \n\n\n          Italy\n         \n         , and laid the foundation for the wine list before Nathan Rawlinson took it over. The list doesn\u2019t trawl for big spenders the way some of Mr. Cannon\u2019s others have, but many of the bottles taste more expensive than they are. Especially impressive is the carefully edited selection of affordable nebbiolos and the range of 40 sparkling wines, which makes welcome detours beyond prosecco. There\u2019s a bit of sake, too, as there is in all the best Japanese-Venetian places.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 109, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/26/dining/restaurant-review-allonda-in-greenwich-village.html", "google_mag": 27.700000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n         WHEN I ASKED a friend to meet me for dinner at a food court near the Javits Convention Center, he acted as if I had suggested we fill a fanny pack with Hot Pockets and eat them on the back of a bus.\n        \n\n         After that, I sharpened my sales pitch. I told people that we would be inhaling ramen that is famous in\n         \n\n\n          Tokyo\n         \n         , and for good reason. I said that we would be drinking beers that were more unusual and delicious than what they were used to, and that for ballast we\u2019d put down a layer of lamb sausage. I noted that we might sit at a tapas bar that in flavor and spirit comes as close to the Spanish ideal as any place in New York.\n        \n\n         That worked.\n        \n\n         Once I had convinced them, my guests tended to like everything about this food court, called\n         \n          Gotham West Market\n         \n         , except getting there. It occupies a block of 11th Avenue in the West 40s that lately feels less like Hell\u2019s Kitchen than Hell\u2019s Freezer.\n        \n\n         But the inconvenient address is the reason this new eating adventure exists. It was built to lure renters to\n         \n          Gotham West\n         \n         , the 1,238-unit apartment complex above and behind it. As any New York real estate agent can tell you, even buyers who think of themselves as pioneers don\u2019t want to mill corn and slaughter hogs like Pa Ingalls. Gotham West\u2019s developer tried to answer that objection by bringing forth a troop of places to eat in a spot that had almost none.\n        \n\n         It is not the only effort to\n         \n          upgrade the food court\n         \n         , long the province of soft pizzas, sludgy stir-fries and swollen cinnamon rolls. A few blocks south, the sprawling\n         \n          Hudson Yards development\n         \n         will have a food hall (the preferred term these days), as will\n         \n          Brookfield Place\n         \n         in Battery Park City. This spring, Crown Heights in\n         \n\n\n          Brooklyn\n         \n         will get\n         \n          Berg\u2019n\n         \n         , a beer hall with food from stalwarts of the Brooklyn Flea and Smorgasburg. Anthony Bourdain, meanwhile, has driven his fans into a near frenzy with\n         \n          his plan\n         \n         to bring street food from around the world to\n         \n\n\n          Manhattan\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         With an unusual degree of imagination, Gotham West smartly stakes out a middle ground between the star power that packs\n         \n          Eataly\n         \n         and the hope of discovery that drives small-business proving grounds like Smorgasburg and the Golden Shopping Mall in Flushing,\n         \n\n\n          Queens\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         Somewhere between famous and brand new, at least to New Yorkers, is\n         \n          Ivan Orkin\n         \n         , the American chef who taught himself to make ramen in Tokyo. Manhattan is becoming enmeshed in ramen, but his noodles at Ivan Ramen Slurp Shop stand out from the tangle.\n        \n\n         Of the traditional ramens, my favorites are the shio, a supercharged chicken soup of phenomenal depth and clarity, and the vegetarian shoyu, darker and heartier, tasting of soy sauce and roasted mushrooms. Both broths were scalding hot, with a fatty richness that made my lips slippery. After the first few mouthfuls of rye noodles, I put down my chopsticks and stared into the white ceramic bowl, trying to see where all that flavor was coming from.\n        \n\n         If I ever showed up at Slurp Shop in a linen suit, I might forgo slurping and order roasted-garlic mazemen, a more recent style that dresses the noodles in a thick sauce, something like Italian pasta. Or I might eat a rice bowl. The one with smoked whitefish tastes like a Japanese translation of a morning at Russ & Daughters. But I was even more taken by the one topped with tender, soy-rich pork and a smear of salty, sour plum paste.\n        \n\n         The chef Seamus Mullen is here, too. His tapas bar, El Colmado, expands on the Spanish menu he developed at\n         \n          Tertulia\n         \n         but is set up so it\u2019s easier to drop in and graze and drink wines from\n         \n\n\n          Catalonia\n         \n         or Bierzo and pretend that 11th Avenue is in\n         \n\n\n          Spain\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         El Colmado feeds the illusion. The cooks are dressed in sky-blue grocers\u2019 jackets and dark gray caps, and the counter is propped with jars of squid and cans of piment\u00f3n next to oysters on ice. They are excellent, as is the Serrano ham, which falls from a vintage Berkel slicer in shaggy pink leaves that are meltingly pliable.\n        \n\n         With the exception of fried artichokes smothered below overdressed arugula, the cooking has a light hand that befits the elemental flavors of Spanish cuisine. Frying is a strength, in croquettes filled with smoked eel, or fried whitebait, their pinpoint black eyes staring up from a swirl of lemon-yellow aioli. Lamb meatballs are a model of the form. So are the gambas al ajillo, red shrimp in a quarter-inch of garlic- and shrimp-infused olive oil that I would drink from a shot glass.\n        \n\n         The market showed some discernment in electing Caroline Fidanza\u2019s Little Chef as a delegate from Brooklyn. Ms. Fidanza helped create the borough\u2019s current restaurant aesthetic as the first chef of\n         \n          Diner\n         \n         in Williamsburg, before she downshifted to a smaller shop,\n         \n          Saltie\n         \n         . Little Chef\u2019s menu expands a bit on Saltie\u2019s, adding soups and spirited juice blends. (I\u2019m a fan of the carrot and fresh turmeric cocktail.) The core mission is the same, though: lavishing care on breakfast and lunch with a modest roster of eggs and sandwiches. Simplicity is luxury in the Ship\u2019s Biscuit, a raft of creamy scrambled eggs and ricotta on very fresh focaccia studded with crunchy sea salt.\n        \n\n         Across the hall, staring down the largely vegetarian pleasures of Little Chef with a meaty gleam in its eye, is the Cannibal. An outpost of the cultish East 29th Street\n         \n          original\n         \n         steered by the chef Francis Derby, this baby Cannibal makes do without a full-fledged kitchen. Sometimes it shows; the brussels sprouts I had tasted like Thanksgiving leftovers. There is a baked Japanese sweet potato that was a wonderful thing to find at the end of a cold walk, but in general charcuterie is the strong suit here, like spicy lamb sausages in natural casings or a surprisingly gentle sausage of juicy rock shrimp with fennel pollen. Even better is the beer fridge, shelved with obscurities that the servers expertly match with your tastes.\n        \n\n         Some spots are geared for the day-to-day needs of locals. Genuine Roadside is an all-day diner annex designed and run by\n         \n          AvroKO\n         \n         , the design firm that did the rest of the market. I got more of a kick out of the hipster-truck-stop d\u00e9cor, with its shelf of vintage beer cans that includes deep verticals of Schlitz, than I did from an uninspiring pulled pork sandwich or the hard-shell ceviche taco spackled together with guacamole. But if I lived upstairs, I would make an occasional lunch of the fried chicken sandwich. And I would be devoted to the high-end heroes built by the Court Street Grocers Sandwich Shop.\n        \n\n         Dessert is a weak spot, especially at night. Little Chef, which bakes homey sweets during the day, closes at 6 p.m. Another early closer is the Blue Bottle Coffee kiosk. The baked goods devised by one of its owners, Caitlin Freeman, like crisp almond biscotti with more than a hint of saffron and the excellent, sweet-and-savory shortbreads, taste best between sips of state-of-the-art coffee and espresso. After dark, the best choices are the old-school flan from El Colmado or the s\u2019mores icebox cake from the Cannibal, worth ordering just so you can see the toasted marshmallow slab.\n        \n\n         Nearly every vendor has counter seating, but servers will run food out to the communal tables and benches in the center of the hall, which is handy if you want ramen and your friends want tapas. The offer is always made with a smile; while the businesses are separately run, they share a common spirit of friendliness. It\u2019s as if everybody knows you didn\u2019t really want to come to 11th Avenue.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 110, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/dining/restaurant-review-gotham-west-market-in-hells-kitchen.html", "google_mag": 31.200000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n         Earlier this year\n         \n          R\u00f4tisserie Georgette\n         \n         put a new chef in charge of its spit-roasted chickens and fish, its fries flecked with tarragon and its baby potatoes heavy with meat drippings, and I couldn\u2019t tell the difference. This is meant as praise, and not the damning-with-faint kind.\n        \n\n         The cult of the new in restaurants has brought us many wonders, but it has also left us with the curse of compulsory creativity. It\u2019s no longer enough for chefs to cook hot food that makes us happy; they are supposed to dumbfound us with flavors the human tongue has never tasted.\n        \n\n         This is why writers like me devote energy to, for example, puzzling postmodern taquerias while taking for granted the simple excellence of traditional ones. The change in restaurant culture is something like the shift that overtook popular music after the\n         \n\n\n          Beatles\n         \n         . Singing old\n         \n\n\n          Cole Porter\n         \n         tunes was out; suddenly every kid with a guitar and an amplifier was supposed to have the songwriting chops of Lennon and McCartney combined.\n        \n\n         R\u00f4tisserie Georgette isn\u2019t writing any new music. The kitchen, now under Chad Brauze, plays standards from the French songbook and plays them well, with what a colleague who has eaten high and low around the city calls \u201ca refreshing lack of creativity.\u201d If this restaurant had a clock, its hands would be stopped at five minutes before nouvelle cuisine, when meat was carved to cover the plate and sauce came on the side and nobody turned down potatoes, when people eating a roast with a good but not-too-expensive\n         \n\n\n          Bordeaux\n         \n         could hardly imagine a better night out.\n        \n\n         You can feel this way at R\u00f4tisserie Georgette, although the joys of time travel end with the Bordeaux.\n         \n          Jean-Luc Le D\u00fb\n         \n         \u2019s list has an affordable 2002 Haut-M\u00e9doc from Ch\u00e2teau Lanessan\u00a0for $62, but the other red Bordeaux have \u00a0been adjusted for inflation and then some.\n        \n\n         R\u00f4tisserie Georgette has a real rotisserie and a real Georgette, both easy to spot.\n        \n\n         There are two rotisseries, in fact, standing back to back in the open kitchen. The one facing the dining room is a tall steel model with brass trim, loaded up with pudgy chickens, small flocks of stuffed quail, dorade locked in a cage with lemon wheels and thyme branches.\n        \n\n         There is one Georgette. Her last name is Farkas. A coiled spring of proprietary energy, Ms. Farkas started cooking in restaurants at 15, attended hotel school in\n         \n\n\n          Switzerland\n         \n         and interned with\n         \n\n\n          Alain Ducasse\n         \n         in Monte Carlo. She was on her way to running a restaurant of her own when\n         \n\n\n          Daniel Boulud\n         \n         offered her a job. After she said yes, she learned that she would be handling marketing and public relations.\n        \n\n         That little gig lasted 17 years, which may be one reason that R\u00f4tisserie Georgette seemed to have traveled from another decade when it landed on East 60th Street last November. The loft-height walls are hung with a cluster of antique mirrors, an Aubusson tapestry and bronze Louis XV-style sconces. Carpeting helps muffle the noise, which tends to wane around 9 p.m. This is an early-to-bed crowd, and with an 8:15 reservation one night I was the last to leave. At one end of the room is a porter\u2019s chair, its egg-shaped back upholstered in leather. Now I know where to seat the dowager countess when she comes to visit.\n        \n\n         In some ways R\u00f4tisserie Georgette is a delayed-gratification version of the restaurants opened in the \u201970s and \u201980s by young Americans who fell for European ways of dining. What set Ms. Farkas\u2019s heartstrings humming were the rotisseries of\n         \n\n\n          France\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         R\u00f4tisserie Georgette will sell you half a chicken for $24 or a whole one, which feeds two people for $36 each. The economy model, raised on an Amish farm in\n         \n\n\n          Indiana\n         \n         , is rubbed with herbes de\n         \n\n\n          Provence\n         \n         and cracked coriander seeds. Roasted chickens don\u2019t always pick up the flavor of the herbs they\u2019re stuffed with. These birds do. The legs are tender without disintegrating into strands, as rotisserie dark meat can do. The white meat is close to ideal, with just a whisker of dryness at the narrow tips.\n        \n\n         The pricier chicken is called the poule de luxe, French slang for a woman with high upkeep costs. It is brought up in\n         \n\n\n          Pennsylvania\n         \n         under Mennonite supervision, hides a terrific mushroom stuffing under its skin, and features a slab of seared foie gras that is both unsatisfying and beside the point. Too bad you can\u2019t get the stuffing without paying for the liver, but I\u2019m sure if I were French I\u2019d understand that this is always the way with a poule de luxe.\n        \n\n         There is nothing fancy about the quail, just juicy meat wrapped around a pale-pink poultry forcemeat seasoned with paprika and piquillo peppers. The dorade, roasted whole and then filleted, breaks into beautiful white lemon-scented chunks.\n        \n\n         A special one night was rotisserie duck \u00e0 l\u2019orange, carved and arranged on a silver platter. Mr. Brauze had defied the modern rule of duck cookery, taking the breast all the way to medium. He knew what he was doing, because medium-rare meat wouldn\u2019t have taken as well to the bittersweet orange-peel sauce. Only once was I served meat that didn\u2019t come off the spit at the ideal moment: a crumbly, dried-out lamb shoulder with a merguez stuffing that tasted as if it had been left out in the rain.\n        \n\n         With any main course, the fat-basted rotisserie potatoes are almost required, although the frites, fried to a mahogany crisp, will also do. But a strict meat-and-potatoes diet can be supplemented by creamed spinach with garam masala, tiny and fiery-hot brussels sprouts and purple cabbage stewed with cider and bacon. I\u2019d be surprised if the vegetables at Ms. Farkas\u2019s long-ago French rotisseries were worth noticing, but these are.\n        \n\n         Ms. Farkas put her first initial on the better of two salads, the salade G, with a time-tested mix of endive, pears, blue cheese, bacon and candied walnuts. There is also a salade Francine. If I were Francine, I\u2019d be on the phone with my agent trying to get my name taken off it.\n        \n\n         Nicole Kaplan, the pastry chef who made her name at\n         \n          Eleven Madison Park\n         \n         and\n         \n          Del Posto\n         \n         , handles the desserts, mostly stock characters from the bistro repertory. The tarte Tatin has been circling the target: the caramel was too scorched one time, not scorched enough the next. But the chocolate souffl\u00e9 hit the bull\u2019s-eye, and so did the dark chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me in a coffee mug. Neither was the least bit surprising. That\u2019s a compliment, too.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 111, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/19/dining/restaurant-review-rotisserie-georgette-on-the-upper-east-side.html", "google_mag": 23.899999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n         \u201cThe chef calls this one the gun, because it hits you,\u201d our server at Cagen said promisingly as she set the night\u2019s last bite, a stubby little handroll, on the table. Glossy and dark, it looked, if you had a suggestible turn of mind, something like the barrel of a snub-nose revolver, with a metallic sheen it got from its seaweed wrapper, a rare blend of green and black kelp. The gunpowder was inside: an extra-hot, nostril-punishing slug of wasabi implanted alongside strands of sweet squash, waiting to go off when I bit into it.\n        \n\n         The maker of this nifty loaded firearm is Toshio Tomita, the chef and owner of Cagen, which opened last summer in the East Village. Mr. Tomita worked for 16 years for\n         \n          Nobu Matsuhisa\n         \n         , and he has his mentor\u2019s ability to bend Japanese tradition in his own directions.\n        \n\n         If you\u2019ve tasted the shiso chimichurri at\n         \n          Nobu\n         \n         , you won\u2019t be surprised to hear that Mr. Tomita serves it with sashimi at Cagen, but this is his own version, made not just with shiso but also with wild Japanese wild ginger, yuzu juice and more than a little jalape\u00f1o. Next to it is a dish of soy cooked with mirin, but it was the chimichurri I kept coming back to, basting it on pliant slices of skipjack, sea robin or suzuki, the Japanese sea bass.\n        \n\n         One minute Mr. Tomita will do the unadorned, noninterventionist thing you expect from a Japanese chef. His ingredients, especially the fish he brings in from Japan, are often exceptional. Three broiled fillets of ayu, a Japanese trout, wore nothing but their shimmering skins, the better to show off their delicate freshwater taste.\n        \n\n         The next he will throw a curve. A plate of small appetizers offered ham deep-fried katsu style with a splotch of Worcestershire on its panko crust, along with a single mouthful of the Nobu classic, miso-marinated black cod, as irresistible as ever.\n        \n\n         But then there were two little flavor bombs of grape tomato halves barely cooked in white wine and yuzu. Were they pickles or candied fruit, or both? Either way, I wanted more. And what was inside this little paper parcel secured with a twist-tie? A pea-size speck of goat cheese, white chocolate and wasabi. It tasted like an after-dinner mint from another planet.\n        \n\n         Cagen inhabits the empty shell left behind by\n         \n          Kajitsu when it moved to Midtown\n         \n         . Kajitsu specializes in the vegan cuisine of Japan\u2019s Zen temples, and the two basement-level dining rooms of\n         \n          the East Village original\n         \n         had a monastic severity; the walls were coated with sand from Kyoto, and everything else followed that color scheme. Mr. Tomita appears to have moved in and gotten right down to work, without putting too much energy into redecorating. Time has not brightened the interior\u2019s subterranean charms, which could use a fresh coat of good cheer.\n        \n\n         You notice this more at the tables than you do at the counter, where Mr. Tomita\u2019s samurai intensity supplies extra atmosphere. Cagen is a kappo ryori restaurant, in which the chef prepares most of the food facing the diners across a counter. (Mr. Tomita\u2019s son, Rei, works on hot dishes out of sight in the kitchen.) You can pick a path across the \u00e0 la carte menu or just free-fall with a seven-course, $120 omakase meal.\n        \n\n         It\u2019s a question of budget and time, but the big splurge shows off all the things Cagen does very well: sashimi with that nervy chimichurri, sushi wrapped in grilled seaweed that crackles like autumn leaves, and zaru soba, served as three small ponytail bunches of cool soba noodles. The first is plain, the next is dusted with yuzu peel, the last is freckled with kuro shichimi, the black seven-spice blend. They all get dunked in a soy dipping sauce.\n        \n\n         When they\u2019re gone, you get a pitcher of the hot, cloudy water they were cooked in, for pouring into the dipping sauce. Good as this fancy Cup-a-Soup was, I always wished I had more of the firm, nutty noodles. Then I would look over the counter at the two matching stones that grind each day\u2019s soba flour out of whole buckwheat. Each stone is the size of a birdbath and they are powered by hand \u2014 Mr. Tomita\u2019s hands. The thought of all that labor was the only thing that stopped me from asking for seconds.\n        \n\n\n          ***\n         \n\n\n         Given the rate at which Michael White\u2019s\n         \n          Altamarea Group\n         \n         spits out restaurants these days, this column has adopted a new policy. The amount of time spent critiquing each Altamarea place will be proportional to the time Altamarea spent coming up with the idea. This review of Ristorante Morini, open since December, will be brief.\n        \n\n         The name, a tribute to Mr. White\u2019s mentor in the kitchen, has been used before, at\n         \n          Osteria Morini\n         \n         , which this new restaurant doesn\u2019t resemble in any way. The downtown osteria serves the fun, lusty food of Emilia-Romagna, while the ristorante, on the Upper East Side, is not defined by Italian geography or, really, much of anything. The website promises \u201cpan-Italian regional cuisine with a menu that covers various seasonal specialties, both inland and coastal.\u201d Well, that narrows it down.\n        \n\n         The menu is most similar to that at Mr. White\u2019s\n         \n          Marea\n         \n         , and while seafood isn\u2019t the only choice, in my experience it tended to outshine other options, like the fine but slightly dull sage-roasted chicken or short rib braised in red wine. Main courses were mostly memorable for their prices, which start at $35 and inflate from there.\n        \n\n         But dull dishes are rare. Gordon Finn, the executive chef, is turning out the most carefully prepared and well-considered food that the Altamarea Group has given New York since Ai Fiori opened in 2010. You should get an excellent meal if you stick to the cured and raw crudi, like the wonderful bay scallops with bits of pink grapefruit and dots of pistachio pur\u00e9e; the pastas, which are as good as they are at any Michael White restaurant, which is to say they are as good as at any place in the city; and dessert, overseen by Altamarea\u2019s corporate pastry chef, Robert Truitt.\n        \n\n         What you won\u2019t get is a solid argument for going there and not to another Altamarea subsidiary. If you want refined, expensive seafood, you can get it in much more attractive surroundings at Marea. Inside Ristorante Morini\u2019s split-level space, the chandeliers look like grotesque experiments in stretched skin, and the artwork is the type that speaks eloquently of corporate tax write-offs.\n        \n\n         Ristorante Morini hasn\u2019t bestirred itself to become a unique destination; it seems to want nothing more than a piece of the action in a neighborhood whose residents proved long ago that they don\u2019t mind overpaying for pasta.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 112, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/30/dining/restaurant-review-cagen-in-the-east-village-and-ristorante-morini-on-the-upper-east-side.html", "google_mag": 21.5}, {"review_text": "\n         Lately I\u2019ve been keenly aware of needs I didn\u2019t realize I had, like dress shoes with ice cleats, an age-appropriate ski cap, self-shoveling sidewalks and a car that can hop sideways over snowbanks into empty parking spots. With the first bite of my first course at a new restaurant in\n         \n\n\n          Brooklyn\n         \n         called\n         \n          Dover\n         \n         , I knew I\u2019d been missing something else, too.\n        \n\n         Broiled oysters.\n        \n\n         Specifically, these were\n         \n\n\n          Wellfleet\n         \n         oysters, keeping warm under a lightly toasted blanket of one of those eggy, creamy Gallic sauces. Vaguely old-fashioned, the oysters were just rich enough to feel like an extravagance without bringing on gloomy reflections about the brief duration of our time on earth.\n        \n\n         It turned out that my winter had been missing more than just broiled oysters. It was missing the style of cooking that they represent. The style is often French in spirit if not in all its particulars. It is both refined and generous, and it responds to the time of year not just in its choice of ingredients but in its instincts for feeding seasonal cravings. It is a style that Dover\u2019s chefs, Joseph Ogrodnek and Walker Stern, practice fluently and charmingly. If the rigorously tweezered austerity that is in vogue in the city\u2019s kitchens has begun to seem as comforting as an icicle, Dover\u2019s cooking will strike you as a sweet relief.\n        \n\n         Mr. Ogrodnek and Mr. Stern met in culinary school. Their orbits crossed again at\n         \n          Alain Ducasse\u2019s satellite in the Essex House\n         \n         , and then in 2011 when they built Battersby, a broom closet of a restaurant on Smith Street. They worked side by side in a space as roomy as the back seat of a Mini Cooper. (Think of them the next time you say you\u2019d do more cooking if your kitchen were bigger.) Since Battersby opened,\n         \n          long waits have been routine\n         \n         , except for diners who are hungry at the stroke of 5:30 p.m. or who reserve for the much-praised tasting menus.\n        \n\n         At Dover, a few blocks away on the Carroll Gardens end of Court Street, anyone can make a reservation and everyone gets more breathing room. Fifty or so pale bentwood chairs match the bare wood tables set on bare wood floors. The walls are white or brick, and the paint on the paneled wainscoting is the color of modeling clay. It has the elegant severity of a 19th-century parsonage inhabited by a very neat, unmarried\n         \n\n\n          New England\n         \n         minister. There is also a bar in one corner, suggesting that the minister enjoys his cocktails.\n        \n\n         With some 16 choices under the headings Raw (what it sounds like), First (appetizers), Second (seafood main courses) and Third (meat), the menu is more expansive, too. The servers, bright-eyed and polite, may tell you that it is designed for four-course dining, or may suggest three courses instead. As a professional overeater, I will tell you that four followed by dessert is too much. Three is a fun route if you are hungry and curious, and two with dessert is what, in another era, used to pass for a full dinner. Dover\u2019s chefs do not cook for hummingbirds.\n        \n\n         Caviar pie, at $35, is the cocktail-party classic last seen in the ritzier suburbs, a layered dip of chopped egg and thickened cream under the midnight gleam of American paddlefish roe. Mounding some on folded blini or white toast will make at least two people smile as they scheme to get the last spoonful without looking greedy.\n        \n\n         For an earthier opening, there is a spicy lamb tartare in yogurt sauce brought to the table with a stack of newly grilled pita. Unannounced on the menu, the pita is an example of the care Dover gives to the small details that make a dish. It\u2019s one of several warm breads and savory pastries that appear without notice, like the goug\u00e8res filled with fondue, and a skinny loaf of stecca with a smooth white-bean dip.\n        \n\n         One of the four slots on Dover\u2019s menu should be handed over to vegetables, because the chefs handle them very nicely. An appetizer of roasted cauliflower with toasted hazelnuts and raisins built contrasts (sweet and savory, crunchy and soft) so successfully that every bite was different. A $95 seven-course tasting menu brought sunchokes that had been caramelized until they looked like seared scallops. Even the best sunchokes can use a little help, and these got it from tahini and za\u2019atar, along with candied pine nuts that were sweet and airily crunchy, like kids\u2019 breakfast cereal.\n        \n\n         A French grandmother would say Dover\u2019s cream-saturated root vegetable gratin was old hat. Then, if she were smart, she\u2019d eat the whole thing. The gratin is served alongside a roasted chicken for two that has been likened to\n         \n          the NoMad\u2019s\n         \n         . The comparison is inevitable in that both birds are presented whole to the table, carved in the kitchen, and brought back in two forms (in Dover\u2019s case, the breasts with a simple jus and the legs shredded in a lukewarm salad with a hint of truffles). On my scorecard, the NoMad takes the gold medal in both the dark-meat and white-meat events. Dover\u2019s gratin is a winner, though.\n        \n\n         You never get the sense that Mr. Ogrodnek and Mr. Stern are grandstanding. They are cooking to please, whether they are carefully balancing the lemon juice and cream in an artichoke sauce for black sea bass or trying to inject luxury into the buckwheat served with a terrific duck breast that has a filet mignon tenderness.\n        \n\n         In the colorless trudge of January, carrots and orange sections arrayed around excellent seared scallops were a treat for tired eyes; the melding of carrots and orange in the sauce made a clear appeal to the taste buds, too. The energetic Vietnamese dressing of lime, peanuts, mint and chiles was a welcome break from the wintry mix, too, and from the richness of grilled lamb ribs.\n        \n\n         Did a long, bittersweet slab of Brooklyn blackout cake need a scoop of beet ice cream? Does anything? Maybe not. But the clean taste of verjuice sorbet was an elegant counterpoint to the buttery tang of a cheesecake mousse served in a jelly jar.\n        \n\n         That jar was Dover\u2019s one nod to Brooklyn\u2019s shaggy armies of picklers, and I\u2019m not sure it was meant that way. Mr. Ogrodnek and Mr. Stern don\u2019t seem very interested in playing along with the clich\u00e9s about the borough. It\u2019s one reason their restaurant stands out. When you\u2019re the last one on the block without a tattoo, you become the conspicuous one.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 113, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/dining/restaurant-review-dover-in-carroll-gardens-brooklyn.html", "google_mag": 22.700000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n         THE CHEF was late.\n        \n\n         All 10 of the black-leather-and-chrome swivel seats, the same kind you\u2019d perch on to play the slots at the Venetian in\n         \n\n\n          Las Vegas\n         \n         , were taken.\u00a0Most of us had reserved a month before. Now we found ourselves sitting in the small, bright, glossy, black-and-white front room of the restaurant, which opened in August in the West Village. It looked about as Japanese as\n         \n          Peter Luger\n         \n         . Servers in black suits were offering hot towels, water and drinks, and more water, and then small talk, until it became clear that they were stalling. Were they going to let us eat?\n        \n\n         Finally, Daisuke Nakazawa walked in the front door. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the chef said cheerfully as he slid behind the counter and prepared for work. He had just come back from\n         \n          Pier 76\n         \n         , he said. The police had towed his car.\n        \n\n         Then he picked up a palmful of rice and began to serve one of the four most enjoyable and eye-opening sushi meals I have ever eaten. I had the other three at Sushi Nakazawa over the next few weeks.\n        \n\n         The moment-to-moment joys of eating one mouthful of sushi after another can merge into a blur of fish bliss. But almost everything Mr. Nakazawa cups in his hands and places in front of you is an event on its own. A piece of his sushi grabs control of your senses, and when it\u2019s gone, you wish you could have it again. These little events carve themselves into your memory. So does the meal, 21 pieces or so over about two hours.\n        \n\n         I remember precisely the dull luster of Mr. Nakazawa\u2019s mackerel and the way its initial firmness gave way to a minor-key note of pickled fish and a major-key richness that kept building the longer I chewed. I can feel the warmth of just-poached blue shrimp from the South Pacific islands of New Caledonia, which had a flavor that was deep, clean and delicate at the same time. I can tell you about the burning-leaf smell of skipjack smoked over smoldering hay until it becomes a softer, aquatic version of aged Italian speck.\n        \n\n         We don\u2019t normally think of one sushi piece as wildly different from the next, apart from the inherent qualities of the main ingredient. But one of the points made by the 2011 documentary\n         \n          \u201cJiro Dreams of Sushi\u201d\n         \n         was that a driven, obsessed chef will treat each sea creature as a unique challenge. He\u2019ll ask, how can I make the best piece of horse mackerel anyone has ever tasted? When Jiro Ono dreamed of sushi, what he saw were new dishes waiting to be invented.\n        \n\n         In the movie, Mr. Nakazawa was the young apprentice who cried when Mr. Ono conceded that he had finally made an acceptable egg custard. With his shaved scalp, bowed head, downturned eyes and meek acceptance of Mr. Ono\u2019s criticisms, he gave the impression of a novice Zen monk who was accustomed to abuse in the name of enlightenment. (He also gave you the idea that Jiro could be kind of a pill.)\n        \n\n         Mr. Nakazawa must have learned something, because his fish often tastes as if it has been coaxed along until it\u2019s as delicious as it\u2019s ever going to get. Each slice has a slightly different temperature, affecting flavor and texture, whether it spreads on your tongue or stays firm and chewy. All good sushi chefs do this, but Mr. Nakazawa seems to be able to hit any point on the thermometer with an assassin\u2019s aim, locating a temperature for yellowtail belly that makes its buttery richness into a time-release pleasure bomb.\n        \n\n         He gets other effects by skipping the standard wasabi smear. He dabs Japanese mustard under medium-fatty tuna and the hay-smoked skipjack, bringing out its bloody-lip tang. Yuzukosho, a paste of bright yuzu peel and burning chiles, bites playfully into the cool sweetness of a sea scallop lopped from its shell just a minute before it\u2019s served, its edges still fluttering. That scallop dish is distinctively his, and once you\u2019ve had it you\u2019d know it anywhere.\n        \n\n         Not everything I ate was in that category, and not everything is the best in town. The eel and octopus at\n         \n          15 East\n         \n         are still undefeated, and possibly the rice, too, although Mr. Nakazawa\u2019s has a wonderfully rich, rounded flavor. The $450 menu at\n         \n          Masa\n         \n         may glide to a higher pitch of pleasure, but the most striking dishes arrive before the sushi starts. No restaurant in town does as much with sushi, and sushi alone, as Nakazawa.\n        \n\n         Behind the counter of Sushi Nakazawa, the chef is nothing like the movie\u2019s humble stepchild. He laughs, he jokes, he handles live animals. One evening he held out a tray of sea urchins, their spikes groping the air, and asked each of us to choose one. The tiger shrimp he set down on white plates another night had more energy. With a flick of its tail one jumped up in front of a woman at the counter\u2019s end. She jumped even higher. Another customer, more game, picked up the shrimp just above its wriggling legs, pointed toward his mouth in pantomime (Mr. Nakazawa is learning English), and asked the chef, \u201cWhat is the best way?\u201d\n        \n\n         The best way is to wait until Mr. Nakazawa yanks off its head, strips its shell and drapes the raw shrimp over a cushion of rice. Everything is gently pressed over rice, in the two-century-old Edo style of sushi that Mr. Nakazawa respects and refines. Sashimi is not served, and there are no hot dishes from the kitchen.\n        \n\n         Sushi Nakazawa operates more like a tasting-menu restaurant than most Japanese sushi places. Mr. Nakazawa does not take requests until the very end, when he offers to sell you a second taste of anything. He does work around dietary restrictions, though. (He also notices who\u2019s left-handed, and sets their sushi down with the ends pointing at 8 o\u2019clock and 2 o\u2019clock so it\u2019s easier to pick up with the fingers.)\n        \n\n         There are three seatings a night at the counter. Reservations there can be made only for parties of two, which is needlessly unaccommodating; sushi counter dining is one of\n         \n\n\n          Japan\n         \n         \u2019s great gifts to solo diners, and I can\u2019t imagine Sushi Nakazawa would have trouble filling the slots. Reservations for the 25 seats in the back are more flexible, with staggered times and a discounted price, $120 instead of $150 at the counter. You can\u2019t see the show from the cheap seats, and the room, while perfectly comfortable, will not be appearing in any interior-design magazines. But the sushi is rushed to the tables while the rice is still warm, which is crucial, and the dining room is the place to sit if you want to have a conversation without interruptions from jumping shrimp.\n        \n\n         Interruptions from Rick Zouad, the sommelier, are welcome, though. I am skeptical of pairings with tasting menus, but Mr. Zouad\u2019s choices flattered each style of sake, and the price, $40 for six or seven glasses, is almost a gift.\u00a0There are some very tempting half-bottles of Champagne from Chartogne-Taillet and other small producers or, for $12, about 15 percent of the price of the Champagnes, a 17-ounce Japanese lager brewed by Echigo from sushi rice that hits the reset button as effectively as pickled ginger.\n        \n\n         Sushi Nakazawa is owned by Alessandro Borgognone, whose other restaurant is\n         \n          Patricia\u2019s\n         \n         , his family\u2019s place in the\n         \n\n\n          Bronx\n         \n         . At home one night, Mr. Borgognone watched\n         \n\n\n          \u201cJiro Dreams of Sushi\u201d\n         \n         and announced that he was going to bring one of the chefs to New York. His wife, reasonably, said no, you\u2019re not. Luckily, he ignored her, and eventually found Mr. Nakazawa working in\n         \n\n\n          Seattle\n         \n         for another former apprentice of Mr. Ono\u2019s.\n        \n\n         The trip from the Bronx to the West Village is probably easier to make than the trip from \u201cspaghetti\n         \n\n\n          Frank Sinatra\n         \n         \u201d to raw triggerfish under a squiggle of its own liver. Every once in a while, the distance tells. Mr. Borgognone has been bringing in sorbets made by his father at Patricia\u2019s. The gesture is lovely, but superfluous. The egg custard Mr. Nakazawa cried over, made with mountain yam and shrimp, is the final, transporting piece of sushi. It hovers over the border between pudding and cake, and it tastes like an ending.\n        \n\n         Welcome to New York, Mr. Nakazawa. It\u2019s\n         \n          a nice town for a great sushi chef\n         \n         . Please read those parking signs carefully, though.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 114, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-sushi-nakazawa-in-the-west-village.html", "google_mag": 31.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n         There were more luxurious fine-dining restaurants in New York than\n         \n          Corton\n         \n         , which closed this summer after nearly five years in TriBeCa, but very few that could deliver as many high-wire thrills.\n         \n          Paul Liebrandt\n         \n         \u2019s cooking challenged you to pay attention. The precisely calibrated flavors might be contained in a single mouthful, or might unscroll themselves as you ate your way across several plates. The harmonies were multilayered, and so were the rewards.\n        \n\n         Corton earned three stars from\n         \n\n\n          The New York Times\n         \n         and two from Michelin, yet the acclaim didn\u2019t translate into the kind of love that fills dining rooms. While other restaurants serving far less compelling food at similar prices were booked weeks ahead, tables at Corton could often be found with just a few hours\u2019 notice. This seemed wrong to me, and it must have seemed wrong to Mr. Liebrandt, too. This summer, he opened the Elm in a new hotel in Williamsburg,\n         \n\n\n          Brooklyn\n         \n         ,\n         \n          extricating himself from Corton\n         \n         weeks later.\n        \n\n         \u201cHonestly, I wanted to do a restaurant that would reach a clientele that would never, ever have come to Corton,\u201d\n         \n          he told the blog Grub Street\n         \n         . Corton was hushed; the Elm plays music. Corton\u2019s tiny bar seemed like a waiting room; the Elm\u2019s is a hangout. Corton\u2019s menu offered two tasting menus, one long and the other longer; the Elm\u2019s lets you drop in for a bite, a meal or something in between. You can study the food or just eat it while in the background Jarvis Cocker sings,\n         \n          \u201cI want to live like common people, I want to do whatever common people do.\u201d\n         \n\n\n         The Elm, in other words, would be just like a hundred other restaurants if not for Mr. Liebrandt. He has ratcheted down the complexity and the number of surprises in his cooking. This could have dumbed down the cuisine, but it has focused its pleasures instead. He has tied one hand behind his back and made that seem like an advantage.\n        \n\n         A dish called Flavors of Bouillabaisse, in quotation marks, sounds ominous, as if the Proven\u00e7al classic has been turned into edible powders. It is lovely. Mr. Liebrandt has kept it in seafood-stew form but rearranged the emphasis. He leans strongly on the sweet perfume of fennel and orange peel in the luxurious, halfway-sweet emulsion that swirls around razor clams, oysters, bits of lobster and a brick of meaty tilefish.\n        \n\n         How do you eat something called Summer Garden? When a black Dutch oven arrived at the table, filled with what our server called \u201cliterally around 50 different vegetables and fruits\u201d bobbing in a green herb sauce, we plunged into the chaos. Some of those vegetables were raw, some were pickled, some were roasted, some were braised; all tasted extremely fresh and delicious.\n        \n\n         Instead of appetizers and main courses, Mr. Liebrandt\u2019s menu puts forth mix-and-match categories called Raw, Sea, Land and Share, with so much overlap that the point is hard to follow. Foie gras torchon, listed under Raw, was of course cooked before it was topped, thrillingly, with pickled strawberry jelly and pungent cracked long pepper.\n        \n\n         More confounding is the Share category, where Mr. Liebrandt seems to be trying to catch the large-format wave without changing the way he composes his plates. Except for the Summer Garden, these consist of two main-course servings of one dish arranged inside a casserole or pan that played no apparent role in its preparation. It\u2019s your job to transfer each element to a plate. So, for example, turbot stuffed with a pale green vein of leek mousse has to be fished out with two spoons and dropped unsteadily upon a bowl of summer beans.\n        \n\n         There is no reason not to do all this work in the kitchen. My turbot certainly lost something in the journey, including whatever warmth it once had. The chicken Kiev had less to lose. Mr. Liebrandt prepares the log of white meat without the traditional bark of fried bread crumbs that makes it crunchy fun to eat. Once you\u2019ve stabbed the skin and watched the melted butter gush out, the show is over.\n        \n\n         From his days at\n         \n          Atlas\n         \n         and\n         \n          Papillon\n         \n         in the early 2000s, Mr. Liebrandt has had a fearless palate that didn\u2019t try to please everybody. So it\u2019s a little surprising that the few disappointments at the Elm err on the side of dullness. Blobs of Mr. Liebrandt\u2019s swell homage to HP sauce couldn\u2019t salvage one of the Land courses, a long-cooked short rib that was dry and dull and, on one of the two nights I tried it, almost as gray as pot roast.\n        \n\n         But while you can find a couple of sleepwalkers on nearly any menu, you\u2019d be lucky to find just one dish as good as Flavors of Bouillabaisse. The Elm has at least a half-dozen that equal or surpass it, and none of them is more than $30.\n        \n\n         I stopped noticing bacon in restaurant cooking a long time ago, but I was almost knocked on my back by the intensity of the spicy, smoky bacon XO sauce that lifts a beet salad to a higher plane of awesomeness. The gnudi splayed around a browned sea scallop were a little sticky, but I forgot that, once I tasted their wildly rich coconut-milk sauce, lush with Kaffir lime and galangal. And there is nothing safe or dull about the charred eggplant pur\u00e9e beside the lamb neck. Terrifyingly black and shiny, like nothing that humans are meant to eat, it has a deep and enduring flavor that goes on even longer than the taste of the gorgeously sticky lamb, and that is saying something.\n        \n\n         My reservations about the shared plates definitely do not extend to the fruit tart for two, a conglomeration of meringue chips, berries, lemon grass marshmallows and flowers that shows up under a glass cloche looking like a prom corsage. In fact, I had no reservations about any of Jeffrey Sytsma\u2019s desserts, or about the wedge of aged goat cheese from\n         \n\n\n          Vermont\n         \n         Creamery that the Elm serves with pistachio croutons and a twisted band of apricot.\n        \n\n         I could complain that the dining room, in the open basement of the\n         \n          King & Grove Williamsburg hotel\n         \n         , isn\u2019t as fixated on the details as the kitchen is. The servers were amiable, but apt to say things like \u201cHow\u2019s that lamb working out for you?\u201d when not mangling the pronunciation of \u201cEton mess\u201d in a way that Eton\u2019s headmasters would have once rewarded with a caning. When a fork clattered to the concrete floor, nobody noticed. And the phrase that runs through my mind each time I look at the bulbous glass lamps on the ends of long, thin, bent rods is \u201calien probes.\u201d\n        \n\n         Building a restaurant that can keep company with Mr. Liebrandt is no easy job, however. \u201cYou\u2019ll never live like common people,\u201d Jarvis Cocker is singing now.\n         \n          \u201cYou\u2019ll never do what common people do.\u201d\n         \n\n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 115, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-the-elm-in-williamsburg-brooklyn.html", "google_mag": 25.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n         Because the kippered salmon, the slippery pink lengths of matjes herring and the shiny white sturgeon at the new Russ & Daughters Cafe are the same products you can take home from the old Russ & Daughters shop a few blocks away on East Houston Street, a cynic may say that the restaurant offers nothing more than an opportunity to eat the proprietors\u2019 fish on their plates instead of yours.\n        \n\n         To which I\u2019d say: What\u2019s wrong with that?\n        \n\n         The cafe, which opened in May, is modeled on the store, to an almost obsessive degree. Backlit signs in black and white proclaim the presence of sardines, chubs, rugelach and pickles by the barrel. Below the signs are boxes of matzo and jars of chocolate-covered jelly rings. In the center of the restaurant sides of salmon and whole, golden-skinned whitefish with their slit bellies pointing up wait in a refrigerated case until they are sliced to order by a counter worker in a white jacket, just as on Houston Street.\n        \n\n         But Niki Russ Federman and her cousin Josh Russ Tupper, the fourth-generation owners of\n         \n          the family business\n         \n         , have added to, elaborated on and deviated from the store in ways that make the cafe a three-dimensional restaurant, not just a theme-park homage designed to cash in on the original\u2019s popularity.\n        \n\n         Take, for example, the rye bread. Everybody talks about good Jewish rye but hardly anyone has tasted it. To get a rye that deserved to share the table with their smoked fish, the owners\n         \n          imported a baker\n         \n         from\n         \n\n\n          Massachusetts\n         \n         known for his artisan loaves, Gordon Weissman. His rye is dense and rugged, with a crisp, ragged crust, a sourdough depth and a generous strafing of seeds, not just caraway but also onion-scented nigella. Called shissel, the bread is as different from most ryes as bourbon is from light beer.\n        \n\n         Or take the way that items the store is known for have been worked into the menu. Halvah is sold by the block, but shouldn\u2019t be eaten that way. It should be eaten this way: broken into chewy bits and scattered over rich sesame ice cream along with salted caramel sauce and a spackling of sesame seeds.\n        \n\n         Or take the new line of dishes from the Eastern European Jewish canon that are not sold at the store, like the baby knishes stuffed with potatoes and caramelized onions. Over the years the New York knish has become so dense it could be used as an anchor for a small boat. These little specimens are light and fluffy, and they taste not like flour and grease but like baked potatoes.\n        \n\n         Or take the bar, situated by the front door on Orchard Street. How does a 100-year-old temple to sturgeon get into the cocktail trade? With a reimagined old-time soda fountain of the kind that would have blasted jets of seltzer into egg creams when Joel Russ, newly arrived from\n         \n\n\n          Galicia\n         \n         , in what is now\n         \n\n\n          Poland\n         \n         , was selling herring from the barrel on the Lower East Side. The white-jacketed bartender makes fresh cucumber soda, cherry shrubs, egg creams and excellent Bloody Marys.\n        \n\n         He looks as if he belongs there, and the drinks, with Eastern European flavors like caraway, taste as if they belong, for the most part, although my egg cream was not as volcanically fizzy as it might have been. There is a small but well-considered wine list, too. The sparkling wines, especially the less expensive ones from outside Champagne, might have been made to go with smoked-fish platters like the Anne, which collects some of the store\u2019s most luxurious treats on a briefcase-size board: its famous sable and Western nova smoked salmon, its underrated brook trout, its extraordinarily fine wild salmon roe and its \u201cprivate stock\u201d sturgeon. I asked our waiter what made it private stock.\n        \n\n         \u201cThey get a lot of high rollers at the store, some very particular customers,\u201d he said. \u201cThis one lady came in and asked for sturgeon, but when they started to slice it, she said: \u2018No, no, no. I don\u2019t want your regular sturgeon. I want your private stock.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n        \n\n         This private stock of sturgeon did not, as of yet, exist, but the slicer obligingly found her an unusually sleek specimen. From then on, the fattiest fish would be kept under the counter for customers who would not settle for the regular sturgeon. (As with many stories about Russ & Daughters, the waiter\u2019s account has the ring of folk legend. When I asked Jen Snow, who has the title of Yenta at the company, whether it was historically accurate, her response was long and began with \u201cOy vey.\u201d) At the restaurant, private-stock sturgeon is advertised but is still a high-roller item; the Anne platter goes for $90.\n        \n\n         The Anne feeds three or four people. And it does come with a basket of the excellent rye and other breads; a very good, crisp salad of thin-sliced potatoes with mustard; the house cream cheese, which sets the standard for the rest of the city; and all the usual fixings. Still, $90 is not bupkis, and it is not the only disconcerting price at Russ & Daughters Cafe.\n        \n\n         Forget the caviar service, which starts at $105 for 50 grams of paddlefish and inclines swiftly from there. At the store, long admired for competitive prices on tins of fish eggs, the same 50 grams cost about half as much. The markups are an unpleasant surprise, and guarantee that for most value-minded diners, the caviar section of the menu will be strictly a curiosity.\n        \n\n         At $60, the scrambled eggs with paddlefish caviar may seem like a more reasonable splurge. But when I had it, Mr. Weissman\u2019s challah, although toasted, was going stale and the eggs didn\u2019t have the voluptuousness achieved at, say,\n         \n          Jean-Georges\n         \n         . Some everyday items seem out of line, too, like $22 for four slices of sturgeon with butter, capers, tomatoes, onions and a serviceable bagel.\n        \n\n         For most people, fish on a bagel may not be enough reason to go to a restaurant at night. Russ & Daughters Cafe is open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., with the same paper place-mat menu day and night. You could certainly make a light supper from one of the egg dishes, especially the creamy and soft scramble with onions and lox. (How did the Lower East Side get along without this?) But that is a meal best enjoyed alone with a book. The kitchen offers very little that will provide enough traction for a group of friends engaging in a round of cocktails followed by a bottle of wine.\n        \n\n         Unlike most New Yorkers, the menu looks best by daylight. Most helpings are modest, good for noshing. Salmon roe and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche with latkes, with hard-shell exteriors and fluffy white interiors, seem like breakfast. So does the sturdy bagel chip piled up with whitefish and salmon salads and flying-fish roe infused with wasabi. At lunch the excellent cold borscht could lead up to the herring sampler featuring rollmops, Swedish matjes and pickled herring, which has immediately joined the small list of dishes whose flavor helps define New York.\n        \n\n         The cafe might have a stronger nocturnal allure with a separate dinner menu or beefed-up portions of plates like the latkes. And it might look into slicing Mr. Weissman\u2019s breads closer to the dinner hour so they aren\u2019t as fatigued. I\u2019m not expecting to see any big changes right away, though. This is, after all, a business that took a century to give its customers a place to sit down.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 116, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/dining/restaurant-review-russ-daughters-cafe.html", "google_mag": 25.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n         I\u2019m starting to worry about the steakhouse.\n        \n\n         It used to be a rock of stability. The shifting winds of fashion did not bend it. Its basic formula was so firmly set that you could go to a steakhouse in San Bernardino and then one in\n         \n\n\n          Baltimore\n         \n         and have the same meal without looking at the menu.\n        \n\n         Now steakhouses are swerving all over the road. Their menus read like competitions to see who can stray furthest from plain beef and potatoes. The more desperate they grow in their attempts to prove they\u2019re not like the staid steakhouses of yore, the more they seem to converge.\n        \n\n         Take two examples that opened last year:\n         \n          Knife, in Dallas\n         \n         , and\n         \n          Bowery Meat Company\n         \n         , in\n         \n\n\n          Manhattan\n         \n         . Knife has duck risotto on the menu;\n         \n\n\n          Bowery Meat Company\n         \n         has duck lasagna for two. Knife has a whole roasted chicken; Bowery Meat Company has half a roasted chicken. Knife has half a roasted pig\u2019s head with Mexican salsas and tortillas; Bowery Meat Company has pork belly Chinese-barbecue style. After a while, reading these menus is like seeing your dad twerk.\n        \n\n         But the hey-we\u2019re-cool-no-really menus aren\u2019t as troubling as the way these places insist that they don\u2019t want to be called steakhouses anymore. Knife, according to its website, is \u201ca reinvention of the steakhouse experience.\u201d And here on First Street just off the Bowery, the chef Josh Capon and the restaurateur John McDonald, the team behind\n         \n          Lure Fishbar\n         \n         and\n         \n          El Toro Blanco\n         \n         , have brought forth a \u201cmeat company\u201d whose website says it is \u201cnot a traditional steakhouse, but a balanced meat-centric menu.\u201d\n        \n\n         Just between us, Bowery Meat Company is not, in fact, a menu, balanced or otherwise. But it does have a menu, and on it you will find seven cuts of beef and a burger, potatoes cooked at least four ways and a spinach side dish. Mr. Capon appears at certain tables presenting masses of raw beef draped on a cutting board. And while the wine list has admirable and enticing range, its foundation is a cache of broad-beamed cabernets that are obviously meant to be married off to bricks of dry-aged beef.\n        \n\n         Is it possible that Bowery Meat Company doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s a steakhouse, the way\n         \n\n\n          Bruce Willis\n         \n         in \u201cThe Sixth Sense\u201d doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s a ghost?\n        \n\n         The dining room, by\n         \n          Meyer Davis Studio\n         \n         , could go either way. The right angles, the horizontal grain of the glossy paneling, the broad stretches of simple geometric curtains and the collection of midcentury chairs by Eames and other designers call up the heyday of\n         \n\n\n          Palm Springs\n         \n         and gibsons and Pall Malls and, yes, steak, along with other meats.\n        \n\n         In this retro room, prime beef makes as much sense as Mr. Capon\u2019s swell nods to old-school Italian-American classics, like shrimp scampi, woozy with garlic and butter, or broiled oysters under slightly scorched bread crumbs,\n         \n\n\n          New Orleans\n         \n         style. His zucchini carpaccio dotted with creamed feta, chopped pistachios and fresh mint is very good now; it will be excellent when squash is in season.\n        \n\n         He also makes a terrine of chicken livers and foie gras, smooth in all the right ways and served with onion jam and toasted brioche. This is true luxury, not the mock luxury of a garden-variety deviled egg trying to pass itself off as a $25 appetizer by dressing up in caviar.\n        \n\n         Mr. Capon is not given to rash experiments. He knows where the pleasure centers are and how to tickle them. (So does his pastry chef, Katie McAllister. Her desserts are unabashedly sweet, sometimes to the point where you lose interest, although the s\u2019mores sundae is uncannily precise, down to the ice cream that tastes exactly like a campfire marshmallow.) So his duck lasagna is not some bold invention but a gooey casserole in which the duck rag\u00f9 is essentially a seasoning and the bulk of the work is done by loads of melted caciocavallo. It is meant to serve two but could probably bring four people to a dead stop.\n        \n\n         And there is more. Much more. In the end, I barely put a dent in the menu, though it left its mark on me.\n        \n\n         Connoisseurs of ultratender burgers will go wild for Mr. Capon\u2019s hefty but loosely packed version on an extremely yielding bun. I like a burger that puts up more of a fight, but I loved the flavors of the melted raclette and caramelized onions.\n        \n\n         The most imposing of the meats is the veal chop, thick and quartz-pink. It\u2019s rubbed with paprika, coriander and fennel seeds for a whiff of the souk, but what gives it energy is the juice of a grilled orange half. That citrus-spice alchemy is a terrific solution to the boredom sometimes caused by plain broiled lumps of animal muscle.\n        \n\n         Another solution may be a smaller chop costing less than $52, but Bowery Meat Company understands that one of the jobs of any steakhouse, traditional or not, is to help carnivores spend lavishly. There is, as you\u2019d expect, a proprietary cut of meat from the celebrity butcher Pat LaFrieda, the $54 \u201cBowery steak.\u201d (Imagine the things \u201cBowery steak\u201d might have been a euphemism for 20 years ago.) A mosaic of trimmed rib-eye cap, it\u2019s intensely flavorful, but I wish Mr. Capon would leave the garlic-heavy raw chopped herb sauce on the side.\n        \n\n         The 14-ounce New York strip is $55, is served naked except for some roasted shallots and has a fine dry-aged tang. It was missing only a rough, satisfying crust of the kind the kitchen put on the c\u00f4te de boeuf, a 38-ounce marvel of careful dry-aging and extensive marbling that costs $138.\n        \n\n\n          Demand for expensive beef rises\n         \n         with bull markets in stocks, and the current one just charged into its sixth year. The natural outcome of this is more steakhouses, but lately there have been complicating factors. Women don\u2019t take to the traditional steakhouse the way men have. Many people have ethical and environmental concerns about beef production. The most recent challenge is the rise of the small-plates culture, which has made portions of meat larger than, say, half a pound look a bit unseemly.\n        \n\n         This is why (he said, adopting a Viennese accent) the steakhouse has been acting so peculiar lately: It is trying to unite what\u2019s left of its core audience with the new herd of refugees from the small-plates revolution. Maybe Bowery Meat Company and places like it should just forget about defining themselves in relation to the steakhouse. Instead, they could come up with a new name for a place where you eat an appetizer followed by six or more ounces of meat, poultry or seafood. There used to be a word for this: restaurant.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 117, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/11/dining/restaurant-review-bowery-meat-company-in-the-east-village.html", "google_mag": 24.5}, {"review_text": "\n         A woman I once worked with had a facility for languages that was matched by her self-assurance.

Very few have eight weeks to spare these days, but that doesn\u2019t stop them when, in pursuit of empire building, they decide to learn some other nation\u2019s food. By the time the news releases are ready, a week\u2019s vacation has become a research trip, and a snack bought with pocket change has become a $13 appetizer.\n         \n\n\n          Mexico\n         \n         is a favorite destination for these immersion courses. This has led to the illusion that New York is enjoying a boom in serious Mexican cuisine, when in fact what the city is experiencing is a handful of restaurants that present, some more convincingly than others, a chef\u2019s south-of-the-border fantasies.\n        \n\n         Before he opened\n         \n          Cosme\n         \n         on East 21st Street in October, the chef\n         \n          Enrique Olvera\n         \n         reversed the process. He already had a pretty good handle on the cuisine of Mexico, having grown up and now owning a flock of restaurants there, including the globally acclaimed Pujol. Mr. Olvera\u2019s research trips were to\n         \n\n\n          Manhattan\n         \n         instead. He studied its dining rooms, its menus, its cocktails and its customers. He was clearly taking notes, because he shows an uncannily state-of-the-art instinct for what New Yorkers want when they go out for dinner.\n         \n\n\n          Cosme\n         \n         is cool, but isn\u2019t trend-chasing. It\u2019s crowded and lively, but isn\u2019t painfully loud. It\u2019s comfortable, but isn\u2019t coddling.\n        \n\n         Most of all, the cooking is a thrill, largely because it sails right over ideas like tradition, authenticity and modernity. Many underpinnings come from Mexico, while a lot of the ingredients were bought locally. The flavors are here and now, though; you connect with the dishes right away.\n        \n\n         In the style of places like Estela, many seafood and vegetable dishes turn out to be salads, or something like a salad, approachable, simple-seeming assemblages with a jolt of the unexpected. White ayocote beans, which look like cannellinis and are as creamy as any bean I\u2019ve tasted, are surrounded by mixed greens and sliced radishes, all looking innocent enough; it\u2019s the habaneros and charred cucumbers in the dressing that get you. The raw hamachi dabbed with lime and jalape\u00f1o sounds like another crudo variation, but the jalape\u00f1os are fermented and the limes dried until they turn black; together their flavor is so intense it could walk through bricks.\n        \n\n         Scallops and poached jicama, cut into white discs that you can\u2019t tell apart until you bite down, are dressed with lime juice and cucumber; it seems like a traditional aguachile, but the sneaky, sideways heat comes from grated wasabi. Mr. Olvera doesn\u2019t use heat and spice as weapons; he uses them like a pen, to sharpen and define the outlines of a dish. Dried ground chiles provide some backbone to a sweet pineapple pur\u00e9e served with firm, flavorful cobia and warm tortillas, for making an exhilarating seafood version of tacos al pastor.\n        \n\n         Whenever a stack of fresh tortillas arrived, I would pull one from its folded napkin, hold it up to my face and inhale. It was a motion I hadn\u2019t made since grade school, when I would bring the purple-smudged handouts still warm from the Ditto copier up to my nose to breathe in their sweet, forbidden, chemical smell, like rubbing alcohol mixed with danger. The aroma of these tortillas was completely wholesome \u2014 like flowers, bread straight from the oven, and a baby\u2019s cheek at the same time \u2014 but I still wanted to fall headfirst into it the way I did with Ditto solvent. There are no tortillas remotely like this in New York. Cosme makes them downstairs in the kitchen from old strains of blue, yellow, purple and white corn grown in Mexico.\n        \n\n         The tortillas are one of the few reminders around if you forget for a moment that Cosme is a Mexican restaurant. Many of the kitchen\u2019s innovations probably shouldn\u2019t be copied, because they depend on Mr. Olvera\u2019s deep knowledge of Mexican food together with his understanding of what\u2019s being cooked in\n         \n\n\n          Copenhagen\n         \n         ,\n         \n\n\n          Chicago\n         \n         and\n         \n\n\n          Lima\n         \n         . But one idea that I hope other Mexican restaurateurs steal is the decision to go without all the props (sombreros, grinning calaveras) that say, \u201cHola, amigos, have a margarita!\u201d\n        \n\n         The furthest Cosme goes in that direction are the small potted succulents on every table. Yana Volfson, Cosme\u2019s drinks mastermind, reacted as if we\u2019d stepped on her foot when we asked if mezcal (she has quite a collection) would be poured into rustic clay cups; no, she said, it goes into clear, modern glasses. The dining room hangs in a pool of darkness, where black ceilings and walls recede while shafts of light beam down onto the tops of the tables. You see what you\u2019re eating and whom you\u2019re eating it with; that\u2019s about it.\n        \n\n         The menu is not built around familiar Mexican signposts like enchiladas, either; it\u2019s just a long list of dishes, all of roughly the same size, running down the left side of the page. In the lower right corner, by itself, is guacamole. It\u2019s the one landmark every customer is sure to recognize, and it is literally marginalized. Mr. Olvera might as well train the servers to roll their eyes like\n         \n          April Ludgate\n         \n         if anyone orders it.\n        \n\n         The menu, in fact, isn\u2019t a lot of help when it comes to suggesting how to put together a meal. Servers will suggest sharing about three dishes for each person at the table. Follow this advice, and you will not go hungry; unlike many chefs, Mr. Olvera takes the trouble to plate food so that it divides easily. But you will pay for the experience. Cosme is an expensive restaurant, where dinner for two with dessert and wine can easily creep beyond $300.\n        \n\n         A few dishes leave you wondering momentarily if it\u2019s worth it, like the stodgy, compacted eggplant-lard tamal. And while there is an absolute classic on Jes\u00fas Per\u00e9a\u2019s dessert menu, the cracked meringue made with burned and pulverized corn husks and filled with corn mousse, the rest of them tend toward a blandly pleasant sweetness.\n        \n\n         There aren\u2019t many problems like that, though. More often you get something like the fried pork skin, as big and brown and open as a catcher\u2019s mitt, covered with sliced radishes and avocados. It doesn\u2019t sound like much, but it\u2019s sensational. So are the duck carnitas, slowly braised in the meat\u2019s own fat with orange and\n         \n\n\n          Coca-Cola\n         \n         (the Mexican one, no corn syrup). Or the lobster paired, boldly and unerringly, with fresh chorizo and refried black beans. Almost everything you taste at Cosme seems new without being forced or mannered. It isn\u2019t the kind of Mexican cooking that can be learned on a vacation. It has to be lived, and for that there are no shortcuts.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 118, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/04/dining/restaurant-review-cosme-in-the-flatiron-district.html", "google_mag": 27.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n            In the early days of Thai cuisine in the United States, when pad Thai and spring rolls were exotic treats, Americans fell hard for the interlocking tastes of lime, fish sauce, chiles and herbs. Over the years, that love has grown lukewarm. Many of the restaurants weren\u2019t very good to begin with, and watered-down, sloppy Americanized versions of dishes from central Thailand were the only Thai food many Americans knew.\n           \n\n            When a reformist tide of traditional Thai food began rolling in about a decade ago, it was led by restaurants specializing in the cooking of the north and northeast regions. Now, when thrill chasers tell you about Thai meals that realigned their taste buds, they\u2019re likely to be talking about Kris Yenbamroong\u2019s organ- and chile-laden cooking at his two\n            \n             Night & Market\n            \n            restaurants in Los Angeles, or Johnny Monis\u2019s sticky-rice-centric set menus at\n            \n             Little Serow\n            \n            in Washington, D.C., or Andy Ricker\u2019s deep repertoire of Isan dishes at the far-flung outposts of\n            \n             Pok Pok\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            This northward expansion has brought eye-opening discoveries. It\u2019s also made it painfully obvious how desperately the central and southern Thai food available to Americans needs an overhaul, the way the last shirt I bought made it clear that I could use a haircut.\n           \n\n            All of this is to explain why I\u2019m so interested in\n            \n             Fish Cheeks\n            \n            , a new restaurant in NoHo that focuses on traditional seafood dishes from around Thailand. The menu isn\u2019t particularly adventurous or long by Thai standards, with just five appetizers and nine family-style main courses. Service is still in the eager-but-wobbly toddler stage, and the cocktail list is not so much a minefield as a box of live grenades. But the cooking is fresh, vivid and intense.\n           \n\n            The kitchen is in the hands of\n            \n             Chat Suansilphong\n            \n            and his brother, Ohm, who cooked at\n            \n             Nahm\n            \n            in Bangkok under its erudite and painstaking chef, David Thompson. Fish Cheeks doesn\u2019t aspire to the worldwide recognition Nahm has won. But the neighbors seem to be enjoying it, filing under the awning of fish-scale shingles to take their places on wooden chairs painted blue, yellow and hot pink.\n           \n\n            On the black-and-white letter board that lists the daily specials is a note proclaiming \u201cNo pad Thai zone.\u201d This may be true, but it gives the impression that Fish Cheeks is going to take you on a wild ride careening down the unmarked back roads of Thai cuisine. This isn\u2019t quite accurate.\n           \n\n            The Suansilphongs, in fact, serve tom yum, the sour and spicy soup that can be found at almost every Thai restaurant in the land; often it\u2019s watery and acrid. The version here hums with fresh galangal, lime leaves and lemongrass. Shrimp and knobby mushrooms simmer in a broth that gets extra body from milk, a twist I\u2019ve never seen before but one I approve of. It could be spicier, but the use of bird\u2019s-eye chiles is far from shy.\n           \n\n            Woon sen, the transparent noodles that are almost as widespread as tom yum, are baked with shrimp and pork belly in a sweet, Chinese-influenced casserole. From southern Thailand comes a lush and complex crab curry, rich from coconut milk and hypnotically aromatic from freshly ground spices.\n           \n\n            Nam tok, a northeastern salad of grilled meat with green herbs and shallots, is another familiar sight, but the pork is more flavorful than usual, with a deeply satisfying char on the edges. And I wish every Thai restaurant could make fried chicken with shallot rings and a classic sweet red-chile dipping sauce that is as engaging as the appetizer version at Fish Cheeks.\n           \n\n            If you\u2019ve ever eaten a Thai seafood dish that was undermined by the shallow-pond flavor of farmed fish, you\u2019ll understand why I hope the Suansilphongs keep using local bluefish. In one recurring special, they steam a big skin-on fillet and serve it in a pot that bubbles as it lands on the table. The broth is mild on its own, but the spicy green nam jim sauce and the fresh bird\u2019s-eye chiles liberally tossed over the top are exactly the kinds of aggressive partners that bluefish enjoys sparring with.\n           \n\n            Bird\u2019s-eye chiles also brought a pleasantly psychedelic level of heat to raw butterflied shrimp flash-marinated in fish sauce, lime and garlic. The dish turns up at\n            \n             Somtum Der\n            \n            , among other local restaurants, and the version here is forceful enough to suggest that the brothers have faith that people on Bond Street can take a little pain.\n           \n\n            For the ones who like to walk on the mild side, there is a very likable branzino that has been fried to a golden crackle with garlic. On the side is a dish of fish sauce, which you should dump on top. It\u2019s almost laughably uncomplicated, and while I wouldn\u2019t try to make a meal of it alone, it\u2019s useful as a spacer between more intense bites.\n           \n\n            I would recommend Fish Cheeks even more loudly if the cooking had been more consistent. Pad cha, a stir-fry of mixed seafood with wild ginger, little eggplants and grapelike clusters of green peppercorns, was bracingly intense one night. It was unremarkable a week later, and green-lipped mussels in a perfectly good galangal and lemongrass broth had been cooked so furiously they were rubbery.\n           \n\n            On the short list of mixed drinks, I didn\u2019t object to the iced tea with Cognac, which tasted like a Southeast Asian milk punch. The old-fashioned was bitter in ways that didn\u2019t help it make its case, though, and the mango sticky-rice cocktail simply made me wish I could have mango sticky rice.\n           \n\n            There\u2019s just one dessert on the menu, a Thai tea panna cotta. Servers usually mentioned it offhandedly, as if it didn\u2019t make much difference whether you ordered it or not. This turned out to be the case.\n           \n\n            But nobody judges Thai restaurants by their desserts. What comes before is what counts, and Fish Cheeks had won me over by the end of the meal. It\u2019s not a groundbreaking restaurant; it simply cooks the way I wish more Thai kitchens did.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 121, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/dining/fish-cheeks-review-restaurant-noho.html", "google_mag": 26.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n            One of the 20 or so courses served to me the first time I ate at the new\n            \n             Aska in Brooklyn\n            \n            was a cluster of nasturtium leaves, next to a bundle of burned herb sprigs and flower stalks, tied up with a string. It looked pretty and pagan at the same time, like a page from a Martha Stewart lifestyle magazine for witches.\n           \n\n            This plate was more than just photogenic, though. Wrapped inside the scorched bouquet was a langoustine, very gently cooked to a soft pink. It tasted of herbs and ashes. There were blots of chamomile jelly and a langoustine-head sauce on the plate, too, and when I rubbed a bit of the orange-pink lobster around in there, the combination of flower and shellfish flavors was a complete surprise, extraordinary in ways I\u2019d never imagined before.\n           \n\n            One of the rewards of working as a restaurant critic for a few years is getting to see chefs growing into their ambitions. On my watch, few have done this as dramatically and successfully as Aska\u2019s chef,\n            \n             Fredrik Berselius\n            \n            . Aska, which opened beneath the ribs of the Williamsburg Bridge in July, is his third restaurant. And with each fresh incarnation, his cooking has taken a leap forward.\n           \n\n            His first, in 2012, was\n            \n             a part-time operation called Frej\n            \n            , which shared its space in Williamsburg with a ramen outfit and a coffee bar. Its five-course menu was a great deal at $45, and Mr. Berselius, who was born and raised in Sweden, was already showing a gift for delicately naturalistic compositions in the\n            \n             New Nordic style\n            \n            . But some of the flavors were tentative, like underexposed photographs.\n           \n\n            Mr. Berselius fleshed out some of those sketches when he turned Frej into a full-time restaurant, called Aska. The menus were longer and a little more expensive. Some dishes were too subdued and others were just off-putting; I may still have a bit of a coagulated-pig\u2019s-blood cracker stuck between my teeth. The pleasures, however, were numerous and original enough to persuade me that\n            \n             Aska was easily a two-star restaurant\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            Less than two years in, though, Mr. Berselius closed Aska, saying that he had outgrown the site. New York\u2019s real estate and construction industries being what they are, it took him more than two years to find and then renovate the new space, a warehouse from the Civil War era about a mile south. He installed a bar and lounge in the basement, a patio in the courtyard and a moody main dining area and open kitchen in the soaring, big-boned room at street level.\n           \n\n            Mr. Berselius must have used some of that time to bear down in the kitchen, too, because his new tasting menus vault past the ones at the old Aska. They are longer, and much more expensive, at $145 for 10 courses and $215 for 19 courses, service included. But the flavors don\u2019t hide anymore; they have an insistent presence, and their dynamics are beautifully modulated from one dish to the next.\n           \n\n            You will still be eating things you probably didn\u2019t think you wanted to eat. A new pig\u2019s blood creation has replaced the cracker, and this time it leaves a memory I\u2019m happy to be haunted by. The blood lends a mineral tang to an appealingly tender traditional Swedish pancake set under rose petals, cherries and a sweet-sour rose hip jelly. It looks, and even tastes, a little like a thin chocolate cake. (Blood imitates chocolate again in a little truffle that shows up at the end of the night.)\n           \n\n            Reindeer lichen, another ingredient that didn\u2019t entirely win me over last time around, is back. I may never learn to love the way a clump of it feels in my mouth \u2014 like a cross between kataifi pastry and a hairball \u2014 but I loved the chanterelles and their broth that surrounded the lichen and the swoosh of cream, cooked down to a caramelized sweetness, that was hiding beneath.\n           \n\n            Mr. Berselius is the rare chef who thinks like an artist and gets away with it. His Nature Boy act took a turn toward the mystical on a recent night as he delivered a dish to the table; he recalled seeing a small flock of sheep in the Catskills, amid hills overrun with bedstraw. He said he wanted to bring the two together, which he accomplished by placing lambs\u2019 hearts under burning bedstraw until the hearts collapse into ashes.\n           \n\n            These ashes are then scattered over sunchoke cream mixed with pickled sunchokes. The pairing of bitter cinders and sweet sunchokes was fascinating, and reminded me of baking chocolate grated over melted white chocolate. But one or two tastes were enough for me; incinerated heart may be better expressed as a one- or two-bite snack, like the grape-size puff of pommes souffl\u00e9es, topped with wonderfully smoky flounder roe.\n           \n\n            Part of the program at Aska asks us to look again at nature, and to try ingredients that aren\u2019t sold in any supermarket. Mr. Berselius does impressive things with more ordinary materials, though, like the slabs of scallop and their dark-coral roe with elderflower-scented brown butter spooned over the top, or a simple and remarkably good stick of roasted king crab leg with tiny potatoes, cooked almost al dente.\n           \n\n            The procession of plants and seafood is usually broken up by some red meat right before dessert. Once, it was dry-aged beef bathed in rendered beef fat, tasting the way the air at Peter Luger smells: hypnotic. More recently, there were a few deep-red slices of wild wood pigeon, brought in from Scotland; a very fine thing on a chilly, windy fall night.\n           \n\n            After that came an amazing sorbet of raw milk served with little strawberries preserved during the summer, along with some fermented juice on its way to becoming wine. This was followed by birch ice cream under white slices of raw pine mushrooms and woodruff leaves, an odd, herbaceous and unexpectedly stirring combination. In my tour of duty, I\u2019ve eaten a number of dishes that were supposed to represent a walk in the woods, but none came as close to capturing the forest\u2019s aromas as this one.\n           \n\n            The service is warm and unpretentious, even down to earth. Guidance through the wine list, which has some fashionably esoteric choices alongside some excellent, familiar ones, isn\u2019t quite as fluid as at the old Aska, but the servers know how to listen and respond.\n           \n\n            Their tone is especially welcoming in the basement lounge, where you can sprawl on a couch or unwind at a small table over a martini that\u2019s been Nordicized with Icelandic birch liqueur and syrup distilled from prehistoric amber. The \u00e0 la carte menu downstairs offers a fantastic cured pork shoulder in mushroom vinaigrette, or red-leaf lettuce leaves dotted with a mash of smoked hake that tastes like unusually good gefilte fish. These and other dishes may not be the makings of a filling weeknight meal, but they do provide a fine, low-cost introduction to the Aska worldview.\n           \n\n            Mr. Berselius has a lyrical sensibility, though it seems to have abandoned him when it came time to design the main dining room. The tablecloths and the ceiling are black, which makes most of the room disappear.\n           \n\n            When I was there, most of the tables were taken by couples seated side by side, facing the open kitchen. It looked as if they were at a cabaret, waiting for the show to start. By the third hour of the night, I was restless and conscious of the passage of time; I kept expecting the cooks to do something, maybe sing a little Sondheim.\n           \n\n            The atmosphere at a lot of tasting-menu restaurants can feel a little inert. This tends not to matter very much to most customers, few of whom are going to put a $215 19-course menu into their regular rotation. What they want is a delicious, memorable night that takes them to places they haven\u2019t been before. Aska does all of that, and throws in a little blood and poetry.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 122, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/06/dining/aska-review-brooklyn.html", "google_mag": 27.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n         Time to cheer for\n         \n          Aquavit\n         \n         and its power to defy the forces of gravity.\n        \n\n         Time drags down restaurants in New York. It turns hot spots into castoffs and grand dining rooms into whispery museums. Hakan Swahn opened Aquavit in 1987. Over the last 27 years, it made the reputation of one\n         \n          Marcus Samuelsson\n         \n         and transferred from a light-drenched atrium with a defining waterfall to a more prosaic space in a pink-granite tower in the East 50s.\n        \n\n         The move happened a decade ago, but Aquavit still seems to be struggling to find the right tone in its dining room, which still isn\u2019t as comfortable as it could be. Its kitchen is soaring, though. Emma Bengtsson, who took over as executive chef last spring, is cooking modern Scandinavian cuisine as delicious as any I\u2019ve ever had in this restaurant.\n        \n\n         In three-course prix fixe menus as well as five- or eight-course tastings, she juxtaposes flavors and textures in ways that are both complex and finely tuned. Even more crucially, her ideas are fresh without aping fashionable Nordic tropes, which would have been the wrong way to bid for relevance. Ms. Bengtsson sprinkles enough sea buckthorn around to show she\u2019s perfectly aware of what\u2019s happening in\n         \n\n\n          Copenhagen\n         \n         , but she is in no apparent danger of disappearing inside a cloud of hay smoke. She is her own chef.\n        \n\n         Almost every dish is denoted by a pair of ingredients, but there is always more to the story. For \u201cscallop and radish,\u201d slices of raw scallops are given extra depth by white soy and fish sauce, and shaved breakfast radishes are tucked around them. Unannounced, but pivotal, is a brightly flavored froth of ramps. This green fluff has been sprinkled with puffed buckwheat kernels, whose slightly earthy crunch completes the picture.\n        \n\n         Ms. Bengtsson builds contrasts of color and shape that underscore ones of flavor and texture. She pairs creamy white buttons of delicate asparagus panna cotta with crisp ribbons of raw asparagus. Against both forms of the vegetable she pits salty-sweet gravlax in ravioli-esque pink bundles, sheets of cured salmon draped over chopped mounds of it.\n        \n\n         When a fillet of grilled Spanish mackerel shows up, you can see its slashed black-and-silver skin through a glossy apricot-colored sheath of jellied gooseberry. The gel is also tart enough to offset the mackerel\u2019s rich oils, a clever way of adding acidity without a sauce. There\u2019s a hint of sweetness in the candied pistachios and in the lacy umbrellas of fennel flowers, and more tartness in the poached red gooseberries strung along the plate with cauliflower florets \u2014 some raw, some pickled and lightly charred.\n        \n\n         When Sam Sifton wrote the last\n         \n          Times review of Aquavit\n         \n         , in 2010, Marcus Jernmark was the chef and Ms. Bengtsson was in charge of breads and desserts. (Mr. Jernmark is now cooking at Restaurant Frantzen in\n         \n\n\n          Stockholm\n         \n         .) It\u2019s tempting to see a pastry chef\u2019s training at work in Ms. Bengtsson\u2019s dynamic handling of color, her appreciation of things that go crunch, her use of fruit in savory dishes, and her sense of sugar as a seasoning, on full display in the caramelized walnuts and drops of birch syrup with curls of an aged Swedish cheese called havgus.\n        \n\n         But it\u2019s foolish to push that argument too hard. I don\u2019t blame her background in the sugary sciences for the one savory dish of hers I could not force myself to like, a p\u00e2t\u00e9 of calf\u2019s liver encased in unnervingly sweet cucumber jelly. It looked like an expensive paperweight and tasted, to me, like a Jell-O salad concocted by a deranged \u201960s housewife. But I suspect it wouldn\u2019t seem nearly as strange to somebody raised in\n         \n\n\n          Sweden\n         \n         , as Ms. Bengtsson was.\n        \n\n         No matter which menu you get, there are extra treats all along the way, from a traditional potato dumpling in smoked lingonberry broth to intensely flavorful rye crackers. I was so happy spreading soft brown butter on the seed-packed Danish rye that I probably wouldn\u2019t have minded had the meal stopped right there.\n        \n\n         The climax of the eight-course menu is a stunning imitation of nature that sets yolks of sea-buckthorn curd inside eggs made of goat cheese parfait; snowflakes of yogurt foam dust a bird\u2019s nest of honeyed tuile strands. Eating the dessert called \u201cchocolate and texture\u201d is like sneaking into a box of leftover chocolate cake and quietly spooning up all the crumbs and frosting before anyone notices.\n        \n\n         In short, Ms. Bengtsson\u2019s food is wonderful. I only wish there were a little less stiffness involved in eating it.\n        \n\n         Aquavit is, among other things, a showroom for the graceful curves of Scandinavian design, from Erik Bagger\u2019s elegant flatware to Arne Jacobsen\u2019s swooping egg chairs. But one night, as the meal rounded the corner into its third hour, my lower back began to understand that the spindly armchairs were not necessarily conceived with the rigors of 21st-century tasting menus in mind. My dining companion was perched in an uncomfortable yoga pose because her banquette cushions were too far from the table for her to sit back and relax.\n        \n\n         Lumbar support wouldn\u2019t be a major issue if Aquavit were not so eager to push the longer menus. The choices on the three-course prix fixe are limited, and servers like to say that the eight-course menu provides the fullest expression of the chef\u2019s creativity, or something like that. Whatever the exact words, they were always spoken as if the meaning of life were about to be revealed.\n        \n\n         At times the servers had the somber expressions and postures you\u2019d see at a funeral \u2014 on the pallbearers, if not the deceased. This becomes unnerving when they stand in a row at the back of the dining room, all dressed in black. Once I could have sworn I heard a captain snap his heels together as he stood at attention, like\n         \n          Colonel Klink\n         \n         . My preliminary diagnosis is Michelinitis, an excessive stiffness caused by a desire to get or keep Michelin stars. Aquavit has two now, and I worry that if it ever gets to three, the servers will have been replaced with wax figures.\n        \n\n         But life still breaks through often enough. Sarah Blau, the beverage director, is natural and confident, and she sifts through an abundance of fine choices on the wine list. And the lounge, one of the most civilized harbors in Midtown, has a relaxed tone that the dining room could stand more of. I\u2019d almost suggest turning the bar into a tasting-menu counter if it weren\u2019t such a fine place to chase Swedish meatballs with one of the many so-called aquavits that are really house-infused vodkas. Both have been fixtures for years, holding steady in a restaurant that in many ways seems to be getting younger all the time.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 123, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/dining/restaurant-review-aquavit-in-midtown.html", "google_mag": 24.899999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n         The night was humid, and I was drinking cold ros\u00e9 at the black-veined marble counter that faces the kitchen of\n         \n          Rebelle\n         \n         . The couple on my left had ros\u00e9 in their glasses, too. I did what one member of the pink wine fellowship does when encountering other members, and offered them a taste.\n        \n\n         Patrick Cappiello, the wine director of this worthwhile modern French restaurant on the Bowery, provided the introductions. My Bellwether pinot noir was not, he said, technically a ros\u00e9, though it was translucent, the color of raspberry juice, and as highly drinkable as any Proven\u00e7al pink. The grapes were grown on the east coast of Seneca Lake and turned into wine with a minimum of hocus-pocus by\n         \n          Kris Matthewson\n         \n         . Mr. Cappiello called him \u201ca rock star of the Finger Lakes.\u201d\n        \n\n         My neighbors knew the fellowship\u2019s code and offered me a pour of their sparkling ros\u00e9, Ultramarine. With its precise, almost etched framework of acidity, it was a thrill. The pinot noir grapes were grown along the Bohemian Highway in Sonoma County, and fermented by\n         \n          Michael Cruse\n         \n         who, according to Mr. Cappiello, is \u201ca rock star of California sparkling wine.\u201d\n        \n\n         It was starting to sound like a winemaking supergroup, the Velvet Revolver of pinot noir. But this is just Mr. Cappiello\u2019s way of talking about the 1,600 or so bottles on his list. He likes to knock the crust off the rituals of buying something to drink by casting a favorite producer as a poet of barrel fermentation, a virtuoso of natural yeast, or, to give this restaurant\u2019s name in English, a rebel.\n        \n\n         The assault on tradition implied by the name turns out to be fairly tame stuff, but you bump into it all over the restaurant.\n        \n\n         The unforced, intermittently French food is inspired by one particular rebellion. The chef, Daniel Eddy, comes to Rebelle straight from the Paris restaurant\n         \n          Spring\n         \n         , a member of the loosely bound bistronomy movement. Bistronomy isn\u2019t a style of cooking; it\u2019s a reordering of priorities across the restaurant. The idea is to strip out expensive Michelin bait like linens so prices can come down and everybody can pay attention to the food again.\n        \n\n         While bistronomy put an extra shine on the copper pots in Paris, it hasn\u2019t really resonated in the United States. So Rebelle, despite its bistronomic pedigree, won\u2019t strike most New Yorkers as a huge departure. It should, however, strike them as a very good place to eat seasonal food that flirts with French ideas in exciting ways.\n        \n\n         The sauce on an appetizer of sliced raw fluke is brown butter with a flicker of lemon and a handful of capers, fried until crisp. Say hello to your old friend skate Grenobloise, but reimagined as chilled sashimi, and approximately 10 times better than that sounds.\n        \n\n         And here are leeks in vinaigrette, but not the comfortable old mush you\u2019ve cozied up to before. Snipped into bite-size cylinders, these leeks are younger, firmer, their onion character not completely subdued. What the black filaments of leek ash are doing on the plate I can\u2019t say, but the scraps of soft-boiled egg are there to help when the grains of mustard tug at your throat.\n        \n\n         Like Spring\u2019s chef, Mr. Eddy is American born and raised. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell what distinguishes his contemporary French cuisine from the international style in food that stretches from Copenhagen to Mexico City and beyond. In the case of the excellent roasted monkfish with a pale pink blush at the core, it must be the butter emulsion that insinuates itself about the sea beans, the mussels and the sliced razor clams. In the case of the seared scallops with raw green apples and crisp turnip coins in a bright-tasting juice pressed from herbs, apples and celery, who knows. Nothing, maybe? It\u2019s smart, original and not quite like any other scallop dish I\u2019ve had.\n        \n\n         So far the meatless main courses I\u2019ve tried could be described as a collection of vegetables sharing a plate. The beet bourguignon (beets, pearl onions, braised carrots, raw mushrooms) needed a sauce to tie everything together, ideally one with some fat. And I\u2019m not sure anything could tie Rebelle\u2019s carrots together with morels and peas, but the dish has some distance to go before it will be compared to\n         \n          Narcissa\u2019s carrots Wellington\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         Or, for that matter, to Rebelle\u2019s monkfish, or its roast chicken, a long strip of bird under a crackerlike roof of skin. Absolutely everything about this plate seems to have gone right, down to the golden, papery slices of potato fused in butter-fried unity.\n        \n\n         A second rebellion takes place in the realm of interior design. The nostalgic French restaurant clich\u00e9s that New Yorkers love have all been bagged up and left at the curb with the potato peels. Rebelle has no Pernod posters, no zinc bars, no walls painted the color of Serge Gainsbourg\u2019s teeth.\n        \n\n         The 90 chairs are black, the tables are black, and, high above both, the ceilings and ductwork are painted black, too. At times Rebelle reminds you less of a brasserie on Boulevard du Montparnasse than of a strip club on Queens Boulevard, especially when you start hearing classic pole-dancing hits of the 1980s by Naked Eyes and the Human League. The owners, who include Mr. Cappiello and who overlap with the partners behind\n         \n          Pearl & Ash\n         \n         , one door north on the Bowery, were probably going for a sexy nightclub look. They overshot the mark by a gyration or two.\n        \n\n         The murk may be an accident, but the servers\u2019 upselling is so consistent it must be scripted. The menu is divided into small appetizers for $12, less small ones for $16, main courses for $24 and desserts for $9. This seems to require no explanation, but a server will still tell you that \u201cour menu is designed for four courses.\u201d\n        \n\n         No. Your menu is \u00e0 la carte, which means it is designed to let people decide how many courses they want. They should be able to make that decision without any Jedi mind tricks, like being told that a $22 foie gras torchon (billed as a special but available every night, in my experience) is \u201cideal as a precourse, for the table to share.\u201d\n        \n\n         The gently marked-up wine list can rinse out the bad taste of these check-fluffing techniques. Although there are four-figure bottles from prime real estate in Bordeaux, Burgundy and Napa, so many others are clustered just over and under $50 that I lost count.\n        \n\n         For this modern French restaurant with an American chef, the wines are largely made in the contemporary, hands-off style, and they all come from France and the United States. If you\u2019ve written off all American wines as big, galumphing, overpriced beasts, drink one or two of the lithe and inexpensive creatures Rebelle has picked up in the Finger Lakes, the Pacific Northwest or the Central California Coast. A few glasses should convince you that, following France\u2019s lead, the United States is now going through a delicious, small-scale winemaking rebellion.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 124, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/dining/restaurant-review-rebelle-in-nolita.html", "google_mag": 21.700000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n            You can tell when restaurateurs\u2019 choices are based on cold market calculus and when they\u2019re driven by passion. If the passions are good ones, they can become contagious.\n            \n             Wassail\n            \n            is a Lower East Side restaurant that is deeply devoted to hard cider. After circling back again and again since it opened early this spring, I\u2019ve fallen under cider\u2019s spell, and Wassail\u2019s, too.\n           \n\n            Sometimes I take over a table in the tavernlike back rooms to spend a couple of hours with food in which vegetables get to show off, and there\u2019s always more going on than meets the eye. Sometimes I drop anchor at the long, busy bar and eat fried jalape\u00f1o-Gouda balls as if they were popcorn. Always, I drink cider.\n           \n\n            Hanging out at Wassail is like going to a planet populated by nitrogen-based life-forms; everything is at once recognizable and thoroughly different. The staff plays up the recognizable aspects. Conversations about cider at Wassail often begin with \u201cWhat kinds of wines do you like?\u201d then a suggestion for a cider with the clean rasp of a sauvignon blanc or the cow-patty funk of rustic natural wines.\n           \n\n            I could taste a different cider at Wassail every night starting now and not repeat myself until the end of March. This sounds like a wise use of the next three months when I think of how many discoveries I\u2019ve already made: Among many others, I\u2019ve had Hudson Valley ciders that were as round and fleshy as a Degas bather; Spanish ciders as taut and linear as a Giacometti; a spooky, briny cider introduced to seaweed; and a smoky, brooding cider aged in charred whiskey barrels.\n           \n\n            The roots of Wassail\u2019s idiosyncratic obsessions go back to when one of the owners, Ben Sandler, went on a class trip to a zoo at age 14. He was on acid at the time, which did not prove to be a sound decision. When his mind stopped rippling, he swore off meat and illegal drugs for good.\n           \n\n            This helps explain why the menu at Wassail, which he opened early this spring with his wife, Jennifer Lim, is fully devoted to vegetables. (Ms. Lim converted after marriage and is now fully devoted to vegetables herself.) How they settled on fermented apple juice as the house intoxicant is a story that starts at the Queens Kickshaw, the couple\u2019s first restaurant. Their original idea, back in 2011, was to sell excellent coffee and grilled cheese sandwiches to their neighbors in Astoria. Cider wasn\u2019t even a gleam in their eyes. Apart from sugary, mass-produced stuff, neither had ever tried it.\n           \n\n            That year, though, they went to a tasting of French and American ciders. They had the kind of reaction that Mr. Sandler was probably hoping to get from LSD.\n           \n\n            \u201cIt was eye-opening, it was mind-blowing,\u201d Ms. Lim said. \u201cWe were clued into something that was incredible and underrated and new and old at the same time.\u201d\n           \n\n            Cider began to take over\n            \n             the Queens Kickshaw\n            \n            , but things really got going when the couple found a space for Wassail on Orchard Street. (It must have seemed like a sign that the street is named after the fruit-tree grove of an early New York family, the De Lanceys.)\n           \n\n            Wassail has a dozen ciders on tap and about 100 more in bottles. A number of those bottles are poured by the glass, thanks to trial-and-error adjustments to a carbon dioxide pump designed to keep the fizz inside uncorked Champagne. Apples, pressed and turned into brandy, pommeau and of course cider, are the foundation of most of the cocktails, including a potent and energizing wassail punch of mixed spirits and beet juice.\n           \n\n            Apples roll through Joseph Buenconsejo\u2019s savory courses and Rebecca Eichenbaum\u2019s desserts as well. Luckily, this is not always obvious. Little about their cooking is. What I noticed about a parsnip-apple soup wasn\u2019t the thematic tie-in but the way caramelized onions and pecans broadened the sweet, creamy flavor of the soup.\n           \n\n            Grilled butternut squash was buried under smithereens of nuts and seeds, a kind of exploded granola that added a wonderfully sweet and crunchy dimension to the soft squash.\n           \n\n            I almost always order creamy little potatoes, their red and white skins blistered and blackened over charcoal. Mr. Buenconsejo sends them off in an Eastern European direction with a dill sauce and a lather of tangy goat butter, a treatment that\u2019s both delicate and direct.\n           \n\n            To a salad of cucumber spears and pearls of dripping-ripe melon, Mr. Buenconsejo adds so many elements \u2014 macadamia milk, chopped macadamias, sorrel leaves, borage oil \u2014 that it almost spins out of control, but it doesn\u2019t. One dish that got away from him paired hakurei turnips with wild rice in a dashi that was off-puttingly fishy, despite containing no actual fish.\n           \n\n            He and Ms. Eichenbaum think and cook alike; her desserts flow seamlessly out of his savory courses. She makes a pool of chocolate, softly melting like a candy bar you kept in your pocket, but then reminds you that this is a vegetable restaurant with screaming-pink buttons of beet-buttermilk sherbet and a spill of toasted amaranth grains that pop between your teeth. She can even find the sweetness in celery, churning it into a delicate granita that she scatters around a parsley-root mousse.\n           \n\n            With all due respect for her interest in the produce bin, though, my favorite Eichenbaum creation was a floral, romantic, early summer assemblage of strawberries, strawberry ice cream and a deeply enchanting rose-petal cream.\n           \n\n            The menu is supposed to progress from small plates to larger ones, but in practice there isn\u2019t much difference. Mr. Buenconsejo\u2019s compositions tend to stimulate your palate more than they satisfy your appetite. Hunks of lobster mushrooms given a luxurious bath in butter were served over a cauliflower-mushroom pur\u00e9e and a twirl of gingered noodles with a side of foamy curry sauce; I immediately wanted more. This is both a compliment and a minor complaint. The dish is listed as \u201cginger pasta,\u201d but it isn\u2019t filling the way you expect pasta to be.\n           \n\n            It\u2019s even harder to feel as if you\u2019ve had a whole meal on nights when the kitchen has trouble getting the food to the tables. One time the wait between courses grew so long that my companions and I were on the verge of playing a game of charades to pass the time. On other nights, service at the tables could be glancing and distracted.\n           \n\n            I tended to be happiest when I treated Wassail as a bar where the food is surprisingly interesting but cider, doing things I never expected it to do, carries the night. As a destination for exploring the nuances of the apple, Wassail is so exceptional that I don\u2019t mind working around its occasional shortcomings as a restaurant.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 126, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/23/dining/wassail-review.html", "google_mag": 25.299999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n            The lady had dropped her napkin.\n           \n\n            More accurately, she had hurled it to the floor in a fit of disillusionment, her small protest against the slow creep of mediocrity and missed cues during a four-hour dinner at\n            \n             Per Se\n            \n            that would cost the four of us close to $3,000. Some time later, a passing server picked up the napkin without pausing to see whose lap it was missing from, neatly embodying the oblivious sleepwalking that had pushed my guest to this point.\n           \n\n            Such is Per Se\u2019s mystique that I briefly wondered if the failure to bring her a new napkin could have been intentional. The restaurant\u2019s identity, to the extent that it has one distinct from that of its owner and chef, Thomas Keller, is based on fastidiously minding the tiniest details. This is the place, after all, that brought in a ballet dancer to help servers slip around the tables with poise. So I had to consider the chance that the server was just making a thoughtful accommodation to a diner with a napkin allergy.\n           \n\n            But in three meals this fall and winter, enough other things have gone awry in the kitchen and dining room to make that theory seem unlikely. Enough, also, to make the perception of Per Se as one of the country\u2019s great restaurants, which I shared after visits in the past, appear out of date. Enough to suggest that the\n            \n             four-star rating\n            \n            it received from Sam Sifton in 2011, its most recent review in The New York Times, needs a hard look.\n           \n\n            With each fresh review, a restaurant has to earn its stars again. In its current form and at its current price, Per Se struggled and failed to do this, ranging from respectably dull at best to disappointingly flat-footed at worst.\n           \n\n            Dinner or lunch at this grand, hermetic, self-regarding, ungenerous restaurant brings a protracted march of many dishes. In 2004, the year Per Se opened, the price for nine courses was $150 before tax and tip; last week, it went up to $325, with service included. Eli Kaimeh, the chef de cuisine, changes the menu all the time, but he leaves a few pieces of heirloom furniture in place: the salmon tartare and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche fitted into an ice cream cone the size of a triple-A battery; the \u201coysters and pearls,\u201d a savory tapioca pudding under caviar and warm oysters; the cinnamon-sugared doughnut holes with a froth-capped cup of cappuccino semifreddo; and when it\u2019s in season, lobster poached in butter.\n           \n\n            These dishes, all of which Mr. Keller made famous years ago at the French Laundry in Napa Valley, show his rare combination of American playfulness and rigorous finesse. One could argue that it\u2019s a little lame that Mr. Keller is still trotting them out. The name Per Se, after all, was chosen to suggest that New York would not simply reflect California\u2019s glory; this would be a landmark restaurant in and of itself.\n           \n\n            My quarrel with these greatest hits, though, is that they make Per Se\u2019s new material look random and purposeless. The classics would suffer if you changed one element. With the notable exception of some desserts that Elwyn Boyles, Anna Bolz and their pastry team elegantly wove together, I couldn\u2019t say that about many other recent dishes.\n           \n\n            The kitchen could improve the bacon-wrapped cylinder of quail simply by not placing it on top of a dismal green pulp of cooked romaine lettuce, crunchy and mushy at once. Draining off the gluey, oily liquid would have helped a mushroom potpie from turning into a swampy mess. I don\u2019t know what could have saved limp, dispiriting yam dumplings, but it definitely wasn\u2019t a lukewarm matsutake mushroom bouillon as murky and appealing as bong water.\n           \n\n            It\u2019s a bit of a mystery what pickled carrots, peanuts and a date wrapped in a soft crepe were supposed to do for a slab of Dorset cheese from\n            \n             Consider Bardwell Farm\n            \n            , but a good first step would have been allowing the washed-rind cow\u2019s milk cheese to warm up to a buttery softness; served cold, it was rubbery and flavorless.\n           \n\n            Even canonic dishes could be mangled. One time the sabayon in \u201coysters and pearls\u201d had broken and separated, so fat pooled above the tapioca.\n           \n\n            Mr. Keller wrote in\n            \n             \u201cThe French Laundry Cookbook\u201d\n            \n            that poaching lobster in butter \u201ccooks it so slowly and gently that the flesh remains exquisitely tender \u2014 so tender some people think it\u2019s not completely cooked.\u201d There was little danger of anyone\u2019s making that mistake on two occasions when the lobster was intransigently chewy: gristle of the sea. The first time, it was served with a sugary Meyer lemon marmalade and a grainy chestnut pur\u00e9e that tasted like peanut butter to which something terrible had been done. Subsequently, it was paired with a slick of cold oatmeal.\n           \n\n            Along this gravel road, there were some smooth stretches. Lubina, the European sea bass, was sheathed in handsome golden scales of potato and bewitchingly sauced with a reduction of red wine and port swirled with butter. Bulging agnolotti filled with butternut squash and mascarpone were fat envelopes of pure pleasure. The flavors and colors of roasted sunchokes, vinegared beets, peeled Concord grapes and pur\u00e9ed pistachios came together in vivid harmony.\n           \n\n            The type of daring \u2014 where did\n            \n             that\n            \n            come from? \u2014 thrill that you hope to get at a restaurant like Per Se appears rarely, but it was there in a majestic pile of osetra caviar over deeply savory bonito jelly and cured fluke that had been pressed between sheets of kelp, a flavor-enhancing trick known in Japan as kobu-jime.\n           \n\n            More familiar, but just as transporting, was the risotto, supersaturated with brown butter and creamy Castelmagno cheese. A server appeared with a wooden box and a shaver, and the plate momentarily disappeared under a rain of white truffles. A few minutes later, even more truffles poured down.\n           \n\n            Both dishes, though, came at an extra charge: $75 more for the caviar and $175 for the risotto. The supplements at Per Se can cause indignation, among other emotions. When my server asked, \u201cWould you like the foie gras\u201d\u2014 $40 more \u2014 \u201cor the salad?,\u201d the question had an air of menace. When the salad turned out to be a pale, uncrisp fried eggplant raviolo next to droopy strips of red pepper and carrot, it felt like extortion.\n           \n\n            Some of those prices came down slightly when the baseline cost went up. With or without supplemental charges, though, Per Se is among the worst food deals in New York.\n           \n\n            Mr. Keller was a leader in the\n            \n             service-included model of pricing\n            \n            , although he muddies the waters by leaving a line for an optional gratuity on the check. Just what kind of service is included?\n           \n\n            The people who work in Per Se\u2019s dining room can be warm and gracious. They can also be oddly unaccommodating. When one of my guests didn\u2019t like a sample of a red being offered by the glass, the sommelier decided to argue, defending his choice instead of pouring something new. When I asked to see the truffle being shaved over somebody else\u2019s plate, it was whisked under my eyes for a nanosecond, as if the server were afraid I was going to sneeze. I know what truffles look like; what I wanted was to smell it.\n           \n\n            Wine glasses sat empty through entire courses. Once, the table was set for dessert so haphazardly that my spoon ended up next to my water glass instead of my plate. Sitting down after a trip to the restroom, one of my guests had his chair pushed back into place with a hard shove. Has the dance teacher been replaced by a rugby coach?\n           \n\n            Servers sometimes give you the feeling that you work for them, and your job is to feel lucky to receive whatever you get. As you leave, you\u2019re handed a gift bag. It\u2019s small, but still too big for its contents, two chocolate sandwich cookies for each person and an illustrated booklet called \u201cPer Se Purveyors.\u201d No doubt this will make useful reading some sleepless night, but it feels like the swag that\u2019s given out after a free press lunch. Except Per Se isn\u2019t free.\n           \n\n            It\u2019s possible to pass an entire meal in this no-fun house without a single unpleasant incident apart from the presentation of the check. The gas flames in the glass-walled hearth are a cheerful sight, and the view of Central Park\u2019s tree line past Columbus\u2019s marble head is an unbeatable urban panorama. But are they enough? Is Per Se worth the time and money?\n           \n\n            In and of itself, no.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 127, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/13/dining/pete-wells-per-se-review.html", "google_mag": 35.099998474121094}, {"review_text": "\n         If George Mendes did not have such a strong grip on the flavors and aromas of Portugal,\n         \n          Lupulo\n         \n         might have slipped away from him. It can be a confusing restaurant at first, its messages mixed, its fairly simple concept fuzzed over with complications. But give the place a chance, and you can find clarity in the smells of garlic and wood smoke that fill the dining room; in the way sweet paprika and cilantro sidle up to each other in olive oil; and in the fresh, firm seafood, the grilled sardines and carabineros, red as a lobster, their heads dripping with juices that are as rich and intense as any sauce. The restaurant may be unfocused, but the cooking isn\u2019t.\n        \n\n         Mr. Mendes\u2019s basic idea for Lupulo, which opened a few blocks south of Herald Square in April, was straightforward enough. The name means \u201chops,\u201d and the place is his take on the beer-centered Portuguese taverns called cervejarias. The nearest American equivalent is probably a brewpub, which Lupulo resembles with its hard, low wooden chairs, its high ceilings and its U-shaped dining bar stretching off into the distance.\n        \n\n         The menu gets right into the beery spirit with food that\u2019s left a little rough around the edges. The skin on chicken piri piri is black from the grill, but the meat is juicy right down to the bone. It shows up at the table with skinny French fries and a squeeze bottle of piri piri, the hot sauce that suggests Portuguese people have an advanced understanding of pain\u2019s pleasures.\n        \n\n         Manila clams steamed open in vinho verde with cilantro and chopped spring garlic are simple and wonderful, especially when you soak some grilled bread in the pan sauce. Purists may be let down to find that Lupulo\u2019s caracois are meaty Burgundian snails lying naked on a plate, not the smaller variety that people suck from their shells one by one on any summer afternoon in Lisbon. But wait until the purists get a taste of the rustic olive oil sauce, spiced with smoked paprika and chopped garlic that is warmed but not tamed.\n        \n\n         The Portuguese are masters of what Italians call cucina povera, the discipline of squeezing enjoyment out of inexpensive ingredients. Maybe you have wondered why anyone would choose to eat bread porridge? Try Lupulo\u2019s version of a\u00e7orda \u2014 mushy and crunchy at the same time, topped with a few carabineros and saturated with a shrimp-head stock that makes the room reel \u2014 and wonder no more.\n        \n\n         Mr. Mendes works the same humble sorcery on sweet spring peas cooked with chori\u00e7o. The liquid yolk of a sunny-side-up egg waits to be poked and swirled around until it joins up with the fresh herbs laced into the peas. It has a close cousin, just as satisfying, in the bowl of bright-green favas with crunchy knobs of blood sausage and morels.\n        \n\n         At other times, the kitchen veers off message, with artsy swooshes and swirls that seem as if they\u2019d be more at home serenely perched on the tablecloths at Mr. Mendes\u2019s other, more formal restaurant,\n         \n          Aldea\n         \n         . You can spot these exiles from Chefville on the menu at a glance: the raw sockeye and darkly glittering caviar in buttermilk froth under radish wheels sliced thin enough to blow away, the grilled asparagus with dried and fresh sea urchin.\n        \n\n         From a branding standpoint, Mr. Mendes should probably ship these dishes off to\n         \n          Aldea\n         \n         . But I hope he doesn\u2019t, because his forays into fussiness are at least as flavorful as the more broad-shouldered plates. And some, like the raw snapper with the stormy heat of fermented serrano peppers calmed by waves of coconut broth scented with makrut lime, are at least arguably Portuguese in a post-colonial sense, if you care to play those games in the face of inarguable deliciousness.\n        \n\n         Of course there is Portuguese wine, a short and solid list, but there is more energy and excitement in the beer menu. This document can be disorienting, though, at least on a first visit. Why open a cervejaria and turn over all the taps but two (recently there was one for a Spanish cider, another for the dry, likable Sagres lager from Portugal) to American craft breweries?\n        \n\n         Mr. Mendes has said in interviews that he features the United States simply because it makes more of the carefully, intelligently made beers he enjoys than Portugal, where small-scale brewing is a newer phenomenon. He gave Ryan Mauban, most recently seen fussing over the bottles and kegs at\n         \n          Torst\n         \n         in Brooklyn, the job of tracking down innovative brews from around the country. His list is short but packs in a lot of stylistic diversity: goses (see\n         \n          Eric Asimov\u2019s Pour column this week\n         \n         ) more tart than lemonade, Belgian-style ales with a barely-there hint of Thai basil.\n        \n\n         With dessert, Mr. Mauban may suggest a South Carolina stout brewed with cocoa, cinnamon and a flicker of habanero. It tastes like chocolate soda that grew up into an alluring stranger with a dark secret. In fact, it had more going for it than some of Alexander Zecena\u2019s sweets, like the sleepy vanilla rice pudding, now off the menu, and the pasteis de nata, bite-size tarts of egg custard that were somehow both floury and not quite firm. But there is no point trying to resist the pudim Molotov, like the child of a flan and a marshmallow, or the eggy sponge cake next to a slice of soft, mildly sour sheep\u2019s milk cheese.\n        \n\n         The menu, to give this dead horse one last whack, is kind of confusing. It is divided into Small Plates, Fish, Meat and Garden. Simple enough, until you\u2019re told that all but the last four Fish entries are also small plates. That quirk is easier to get used to than the roar of Lupulo\u2019s dining room at full tilt. The wall of traditional blue-and-white Portuguese ceramic tiles is pretty, but combined with the two walls of soaring window panels and all the bare wood, it guarantees that by 8 p.m. everybody will end up talking about how hard it is to talk. Full-tilt dining rooms may not be a problem for long if Lupulo doesn\u2019t get an acoustic adjustment soon.\n        \n\n         It would be a shame if noise drove the crowds away, because Lupulo gets almost everything else right. On that point, there shouldn\u2019t be any confusion.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 128, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/22/dining/restaurant-review-lupulo-in-chelsea.html", "google_mag": 21.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n            OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 The chefs Daniel Patterson and\n            \n             Roy Choi\n            \n            are trying to do so many things with their insurgent fast-food chain,\n            \n             Locol\n            \n            , that it almost has to fall short somewhere. What I didn\u2019t expect before I ate at the branch here was that the big problem would turn out to be the food.\n           \n\n            Mr. Choi, who made his name selling Korean tacos from trucks that prowled Los Angeles, and Mr. Patterson, who has gently pushed California cuisine forward at his restaurant\n            \n             Coi\n            \n            in San Francisco, set themselves an ambitious project. To start, they intend to build a network of small restaurants that people in some of the country\u2019s poorest, most neglected urban neighborhoods can afford. Beyond that, though, the chefs hope that their example of progressive labor practices, interior design attuned to the pulse of the city and cooking that shows responsibility for the health of both customers and the environment will spark a reformation of the fast-food industry.\n           \n\n            The first Locol was planted in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles early last year, on Martin Luther King\u2019s Birthday.\n            \n             As Jonathan Gold reported\n            \n            on the front page of The Los Angeles Times, the mayor attended, the retired football star Jim Brown cut the ribbon, a disc jockey played King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech and about 2,000 people waited in line for chili over rice, fried chicken on a bun and paper cups of braised greens.\n           \n\n            Watts had reason to celebrate. New restaurants don\u2019t turn up every day, let alone ones whose owners promise to make the neighborhood a better place.\n           \n\n            Competition is stiffer along Broadway in the Uptown neighborhood of Oakland, where the second Locol arrived in May. While there are plenty of empty storefronts on the nearby blocks, there are also fresh contenders like\n            \n             Donut Savant\n            \n            , which sells pour-over coffee and scaled-down Cronut knockoffs.\n           \n\n            Locol sits on a small triangular plaza of tables and folding chairs. Seated at one of them, you can see a taqueria, a sandwich shop, a home-style Taiwanese place, a West African and Caribbean grill, a Mexican restaurant, a beer-conscious brasserie and a branch of\n            \n             Umami Burger\n            \n            . At lunchtime the week before Christmas, they were all busy.\n           \n\n            The partners have plans to bring Locol branches to sites in East and West Oakland that have far fewer restaurants around. Opening in this busy part of town raises a question: If you had other options, would you still eat at Locol?\n           \n\n            The menu is divided into $5 \u201cburgs\u201d and $7 \u201cbowls.\u201d One of the bowls is chili over rice with onion, cheese and crushed saltines. The chili is the bean-and-ground-beef kind, which for some Texans is a deal breaker. I was more bothered by how hard it was to detect any spices other than a shadow of hot sauce. This was less like chili than like a slightly spicier version of the meat sauce my corner pizzeria pours over penne. Supermarkets sell canned chilis that are seasoned more persuasively.\n           \n\n            I ran into trouble ordering one of the other bowls.\n           \n\n            \u201cI\u2019ll have the chicken noodle soup,\u201d I said.\n           \n\n            \u201cIt\u2019s actually chicken no-noodle soup,\u201d the woman at the counter answered, as nicely as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s got rice, not noodles.\u201d\n           \n\n            It turned out there wasn\u2019t any chicken in it, either. It wasn\u2019t bad, this no-chicken, no-noodle soup. The chicken broth had a gingery, Asian lilt, and its roasted carrots had a concentrated sweetness. If I had ordered vegetable rice soup, I probably would have been happy.\n           \n\n            My favorite burg was an egg sandwich. The eggs were gently cooked, not dry or rubbery at all, and splashed with Green Goddess dressing and a fine hot sauce. If Locol had put that sauce on the counter, I might have been able to save the chili.\n           \n\n            The thing I liked best about this sandwich was the roll. Made from a recipe devised with the help of\n            \n             Chad Robertson\n            \n            , the bread wizard behind\n            \n             Tartine Bakery & Cafe\n            \n            in San Francisco, the roll was the farthest thing imaginable from the squishy insubstantiality of most fast-food buns.\n           \n\n            Said to be rich in nutrients, and undeniably excellent, the roll represents the potential upside of the Locol experiment. The fried chicken represents the downside. Like a McNugget, Locol\u2019s chicken is an amalgam of chicken bits invisibly bound together. Inside a thin sheath of fried coating, this composite of ground meat is mysteriously bland and almost unimaginably dry. It can be had as a single patty between buns with coleslaw, as the Fried Chicken Burg, or in a paper cup, with barbecue sauce, as bite-size Chicken Nugs. But the best thing to do with it is pretend it doesn\u2019t exist.\n           \n\n            The Cheeseburg is a little better than the Fried Chicken Burg. Melted cheese, iceberg lettuce, a crunchy pickle relish and a sauce in the Thousand Island dressing family all add moisture and flavor to a flat patty that needs all the help it can get. At about 70 percent beef, mixed with tofu and grains, it is richer in nutrients than an all-beef patty. I suspect, though, that it will give many people an instant sensory memory, and not the kind Proust wrote about. Dry burgers made with filler bring me, at least, right back to school lunch and Boy Scout camp.\n           \n\n            Locol has a vegetarian patty, too. It is more moist, but also a little gummy.\n           \n\n            Instead of soda, Locol has nice strawberry or pineapple agua frescas. The coffee, for $2, is excellent. For dessert, there is soft-serve ice cream. I bought a sundae. A few minutes later, the cashier gave me my money back and said that the ice cream machine was broken.\n           \n\n            The most successful thing about Locol is the feeling inside the restaurant. The first thing I saw when I walked in was\n            \n             a black-and-white photograph\n            \n            the size of a small movie screen of two men riding\n            \n             scraper bikes\n            \n            , the colorful, do-it-yourself modified bicycles born in East Oakland. Other walls were covered with goofy comic characters unique to Locol. Before noon on a weekday, you could hear Snoop Dogg advertising the health-giving properties of gin and juice.\n           \n\n            I don\u2019t know of any other fast-food chain that has put street culture at the heart of its locations in this way. The closest most of them come to design that reflects the surroundings is a wall of bulletproof glass. They\u2019re often the only gathering places for blocks around, but they\u2019re alienating, in part because the employees often look miserable. The people working at Locol are engaged, and seem glad to be there. If Locol can create environments like this across the country, it would be a major achievement.\n           \n\n            But first Mr. Patterson and Mr. Choi have to figure out the menu. I understand why they want to take on fast food, but in the neighborhoods they hope to reach it\u2019s one of the few kinds of food available. Why offer less satisfying versions of what\u2019s already there, when they could be selling great versions of something new?\n           \n\n            The neighborhoods Locol is targeting have serious nutritional problems, from hunger to obesity, but the solution isn\u2019t to charge people for stuff that tastes like hospital food. If Locol were a nonprofit, then institutional-quality cooking might be unavoidable. It is a restaurant, though, and it is run by two chefs who are famous for cooking food that people really, really want to eat. I had a hard time remembering that as I worked my way through Locol\u2019s menu, where appeals to your appetite are about as scarce as chicken in the no-noodle soup.\n           \n\n            Mr. Patterson and Mr. Choi seem to have thought about the social dimensions of fast food so much that they now see their target audience as problems to be solved, not customers to be pleased. The most nutritious burger on earth won\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t want to eat it.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 129, "rating": "Satisfactory", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/03/dining/locol-review-oakland-california-pete-wells.html", "google_mag": 33.20000076293945}, {"review_text": "\n            A wedge of light burns in the night on one of Williamsburg\u2019s less picturesque intersections, just below the dark rumble of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. Down the block is an old-school Brooklyn-Italian dining room serving linguine, veal parm and clams casino. All around, there\u2019s hipster bait: fried chicken, pedigreed pizza, cans of Narragansett, tacos from a truck in a bar\u2019s backyard.\n           \n\n            Behind the windows on this triangular lot, the\n            \n             Llama Inn\n            \n            is something different.\n           \n\n            There are skewered beef hearts under a red mash of salsa that rattles with the heat of rocoto peppers.\n           \n\n            Bites of goat neck, thickly seared and braised until tender, are dark under a glaze that gets its mouthwatering tang from chicha, a beer brewed from Andean corn. Together with a fresh cilantro sauce, it makes the goat so compulsively good that we were all clamoring for the last forkful.\n           \n\n            Chilly and firm pieces of fluke ceviche, starting to go opaque in the acid of a smoky dashi, are wonderful to eat with soft bits of fried sweet plantain and crisp chips of green plantain.\n           \n\n            Ripe persimmon flesh and strips of raw sea bream under frizzled yuzu threads sit in an instant marinade. The liquid is pale orange, tart, a little fruity, spicy at the edges and generally delicious. You pick up a spoon reflexively to slurp the sauce, even if you don\u2019t know this is the way Peruvians eat tiradito.\n           \n\n            What\u2019s been happening inside the Llama Inn since it opened in November is not just different but very welcome. A careful kitchen is interpreting the cuisine of Peru, whose vast catalog of ingredients and wild juxtapositions of influences have not been especially well displayed in New York, beyond a few ceviches and a lot of roast chicken. Llama Inn does both, with excellent raw materials, a free hand and a conviction that all of this should be fun. The restaurant\u2019s logo, a debonair llama dressed in black tie, sets the tone.\n           \n\n            The heart of the dining room, which is uncluttered and geometric in a loosely midcentury way, is occupied by a bar island. Inside it, bartenders mix drinks that are worth starting with and often sticking with.\n           \n\n            A kind of sangria made with pisco and kept on tap made me smile three times: when I saw three frozen grapes on a toothpick serving as a garnish, when I tasted the cloves and cinnamon in the red wine, and when I asked for the drink by name: the Llama Del Rey. The cocktail called El Chapo combines tequila and vermouth in case you want to know why they\u2019re not combined more often. But the tall, icy, honey- and ginger-flavored Matador Swizzle has to be the nicest thing that\u2019s happened to amontillado in this part of Brooklyn.\n           \n\n            It and a good number of other sherries are served by the glass, well chilled. \u201cOur Peruvian clientele likes it that way,\u201d my server said when he caught me warming the glass in my palms to help the flavors uncoil.\n           \n\n            Past some low-lying booths and banquettes is a long counter behind which the 16 items on the menu are prepared. The chef, Erik Ramirez, worked at\n            \n             Eleven Madison Park\n            \n            before running the kitchen at\n            \n             Raymi\n            \n            in Manhattan. His parents took him on trips from New Jersey, where he grew up, to Lima, where they had. But as an adult, he fell out of touch with Peruvian food. He had been cooking professionally for several years when an employer suggested it was time to pull up his memories of ceviche.\n           \n\n            Sometimes Mr. Ramirez borrows an ingredient or two from Peru. For his surprisingly good beet and goat cheese salad, he takes a minty herb called mu\u00f1a and tart yellow gooseberries, native to the Andes.\n           \n\n            The most unusual thing about the fluffy drift of quinoa tossed with avocado, bacon, cashews and caramelized bananas is that Mr. Ramirez has come up with a quinoa salad that isn\u2019t depressing. It\u2019s actually kind of lovable.\n           \n\n            At other times, he lifts and twists entire recipes. The roast whole chicken, with smoke in its meat and blackened chile rub on its skin, isn\u2019t so much an alteration of the Peruvian standard as an intensification. The bird comes with three sauces, each spicy in a different way. One, the creamy yellow salsa huanca\u00edna, is also squiggled over a daunting heap of fried potato wedges that comes with the chicken.\n           \n\n            I would enjoy meeting regularly with this chicken, but it probably won\u2019t happen until Mr. Ramirez starts selling it in smaller portions. Available only as a whole bird for $40, Llama Inn\u2019s chicken is another symptom of the sickness plaguing restaurant menus under the heading \u201clarge format.\u201d Sized and priced for more than one person, large-format dishes attract eyeballs online and in the flesh.\n           \n\n            They can look cynical, though, when they could be scaled down to smaller, cheaper portions as easily as Llama Inn\u2019s chicken or its take on lomo saltado. This jumble of onions, tomatoes, cilantro, French fries and thick, soy-marinated beef tenderloin slices makes a voluptuously good taco when pinched inside a thin, crisp-edge scallion crepe. But it\u2019s sold in a regal $48 platter that takes two or three people to handle.\n           \n\n            The simplest dessert is hard to argue with, three hot bracelets of fried dough called picarones soaked in a raw-sugar syrup. My server lobbied for a different one with lucuma and chocolate made from Peruvian beans specifically for the restaurant, but it never arrived after I ordered it.\n           \n\n            I wouldn\u2019t mention it except that an order went missing every time I ate at Llama Inn. The first night this happened, we were presented with dessert menus and we pointed out that the chicken we had asked for still hadn\u2019t been served. When I later told one of the people who had been with me that it had happened again, he said, \u201cWhat do they have against their own magnificent chicken?\u201d\n           \n\n            With any luck, they\u2019ll get their orders straight before summer, when the door at the top of a staircase in the dining room will open to the roof deck. It would be nice to sit there with a chicken, or maybe a half-chicken, and raise a Llama del Rey to the trucks on the expressway.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 130, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/dining/llama-inn-review.html", "google_mag": 24.0}, {"review_text": "\n            I\u2019m almost always the one who gets the chicken.\n           \n\n            For review meals, I try to let my guests choose their own food. Then I pick something nobody else wants. Often, this is the chicken. I think this can be explained by a remark a friend made recently. \u201cI never eat chicken in restaurants,\u201d he said. \u201cI can make chicken at home.\u201d\n           \n\n            So can I, but every time I go to a new restaurant, I hope the kitchen may know things about poultry that I don\u2019t. Every once in a while, I\u2019m right.\n           \n\n            At\n            \n             Le Coq Rico,\n            \n            a three-month-old restaurant on East 20th Street, I was right. In fact, I think I have finally found the perfect restaurant to take people who think they can make a better chicken at home.\n           \n\n            We\u2019d ordered an old New England breed of chicken called Plymouth Rock for $95, along with a guinea fowl that cost a dollar more. Carved and fit back together, each bird was placed in the center of the table in its own iron roasting pan. Our eyes locked in on the bronzed skin and tapering curves of drumsticks with fixed and purposeful stares that, if we had not been humans looking at poultry, I would call lust.\n           \n\n            The meat had all the things I wanted and none of the things I didn\u2019t. It was moist but not drippy or briny; compact and muscular but not tough; long on deep, rounded flavor that didn\u2019t seem to rely on salt or sugar.\n           \n\n            Some of my guests preferred the chicken, calling the guinea fowl \u201csinewy.\u201d It was a bit stringy at the joints, but once disentangled, the flesh had a flavor I found highly persuasive. Even the white meat tasted like dark meat.\n           \n\n            The menu suggested that one bird would feed up to four people. We nearly demolished twice as many, along with a macaroni gratin and a bundle of stout, dark fries that we dunked into a small pitcher of jus. After we were too full to go on, we noticed an untouched chicken leg. One of my guests ate that, too, down to the bone.\n           \n\n            True, he did it on a bet. But I suspect he would have done it for nothing.\n           \n\n            The chef and owner is\n            \n             Antoine Westermann\n            \n            . His distillations of the cuisine of his native Alsace at\n            \n             Le Buerehiesel\n            \n            in Strasbourg were widely praised before he handed it over to his son and moved to Paris. One of the places Mr. Westermann opened there is the original\n            \n             Coq Rico\n            \n            , a theme restaurant of sorts. Poultry (eggs, organs, broth) turns up in almost everything the kitchen makes, most spectacularly in the whole chickens that are first braised in chicken stock and then threaded on to a rotisserie.\n           \n\n            He gave Le Coq Rico a subtitle that is both irresistible and accurate: \u201cThe Bistro of Beautiful Birds.\u201d\n           \n\n            By March, when he opened a Manhattan branch a few doors down from Gramercy Tavern, he had spent several months scouting for beautiful American birds. Mr. Westermann is particular about how long they spend pecking and strutting before they land on his rotisserie. The menu lists the age at slaughter \u2014 our server seemed to prefer \u201charvest\u201d \u2014 for each breed on the menu, from 90 days for the Plymouth Rock to 130 days for the guinea fowl.\n           \n\n            \u201cThe industry standard is 40 days,\u201d the server said, apparently used to fielding questions about these numbers. (Two more chicken breeds listed on the menu, New Hampshire and Cornish, weren\u2019t available when I went; they are still enjoying country living.)\n           \n\n            A whole Brune Landaise (110 days), a French breed with milder flavor than the Plymouth Rock, is simmered in a clay casserole with potatoes, tomatoes, onions, artichokes, stock and a bottle of riesling. This, Mr. Westermann\u2019s version of an Alsatian baeckeoffe, was terrific, with bewitching undercurrents of spice in a sauce that had body but no visible fat. The price, though, $120, made me queasy.\n           \n\n            A roasted quarter of the same breed, for $24, is Le Coq Rico\u2019s offering for the solo chicken eater. The half-breast and thigh I tried were moist and flavorful but slightly inert, as if warmed over. If I came back alone, maybe to sit at the counter facing the kitchen in a narrow alley off the main dining room, I\u2019d want the squab. Unwrapping the cabbage leaf around it, cutting into the handsomely roasted bird surrounded by foie gras stuffing, and dipping slices of excellent house-baked baguette into the glossy dark sauce is a sure route to Francophilia.\n           \n\n            Shopping for chickens, Mr. Westermann found eggs. Some go into Matthieu Simon\u2019s desserts, one of which is awe-inspiring: the floating island, a single grapefruit-size ball of meringue with a crackling sugar glaze on top, resting in a pond of cr\u00e8me anglaise. The rhubarb souffl\u00e9 is another good, if more routine, showpiece for egg whites. I\u2019d choose either over the double-wide raspberry mille-feuille whose puff pastry wasn\u2019t crisp enough to shatter.\n           \n\n            A Coq Rico meal could start with eggs, too \u2014 or, as the menu calls this group of appetizers, \u201cEggz.\u201d It\u2019s rare to find oeuf en meurette, in all its rich, spoon-coating, lardon-studded glory, made this well in Manhattan.\n           \n\n            Served with a heap of m\u00e2che and spicy pink hummus, saut\u00e9ed chicken livers were glorious, combining the rich creaminess of a soft cheese with the metallic tang of organ meat. I expected great things from the chicken gizzards served with artichokes \u00e0 la Barigoule, too, but their flavor seemed to have leaked out somewhere.\n           \n\n            From his days at Le Buerehiesel, Mr. Westermann has brought along the recipe for foie gras terrine baked inside a soft pastry crust. I\u2019m not convinced this single slice of terrine is worth $32, but I don\u2019t know anywhere in New York to get a better, cheaper version, either.\n           \n\n            The architect Pascal Desprez has slotted Le Coq Rico into a somewhat awkward U-shaped space. By the entrance is a bar where the cocktail menu promises, somewhat menacingly, \u201cthe dark side of Le Coq Rico.\u201d\n           \n\n            There always seemed to be mild confusion at the host podium, and each time I was led to my seat, I was afraid I\u2019d be deposited at one of the tables crammed into the narrow passageway. This hall opens in the back into a stylishly monochromatic dining room.\n           \n\n            Unless you have been to the Paris original, also designed by Mr. Desprez, the only things about the atmosphere that will strike you as French may be the peculiar pop music and, on some nights, Mr. Westermann himself, with wire-framed glasses on a head full of thoughts about chicken.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 131, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/15/dining/le-coq-rico-review.html", "google_mag": 23.700000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n\n             Houseman\n            \n            is a new restaurant where you can get, among other good things, an excellent roast chicken. \u201cBig whoop,\u201d you say. \u201cI can get excellent roast chicken at a place in my neighborhood.\u201d Well, no, you probably can\u2019t, unless you live across the street from\n            \n             Barbuto\n            \n            . But let\u2019s not argue. Let\u2019s talk about Houseman.\n           \n\n            It\u2019s on Greenwich Street in Hudson Square, on a block that the rest of the city forgot about after the Holland Tunnel was built and then suddenly remembered a few years ago. Across the street is a glass-and-steel apartment house by the architect\n            \n             Winka Dubbeldam\n            \n            . It looks like a venetian blind that got tangled up with the building next door. If I lived there, I would have been happy in July when the lights came on inside Houseman, illuminating the white brick walls and pale wood tables and chairs. By now, I\u2019d know the hosts who stand in the doorway or on the sidewalk. And one of my daily routines would be checking out the changes on the menu, which is laid out like a newspaper\u2019s front page. Print lives!\n           \n\n            The date runs at the top to the left of the restaurant\u2019s name. A weather report is on the right. (\u201cGray. Cooler!\u201d) In the middle is a cryptic drawing; one night it looked like a pumpkin with some dangerous ideas. All around the page are boxes. One suggests an inexpensive wine, and another proposes a cocktail made with ingredients you\u2019ve heard of. The rest are occupied by things that I am always very interested in eating.\n           \n\n            Since the chicken is the above-the-fold story, let\u2019s start there. In fact, it is half a bird, with parsley salad scattered on top and a thick slab of grilled bread spread with roasted garlic on the side. But in every other way, it is a classic Sunday night roast chicken. In restaurants, I manage to get a chicken like this roughly once out of every 50 attempts. At home, my average is closer to one in 12. I tasted Houseman\u2019s on three nights, and it was equally irresistible every time, juicy in every flap and joint.\n           \n\n            Ned Baldwin, who owns the restaurant and, with Adam Baumgart, runs the kitchen, said they weigh each bird before calculating how much salt to rub into its skin. However they do it, this is a roast chicken that you want to settle down with and take apart piece by piece.\n           \n\n            Most of the food at Houseman is like that. You don\u2019t taste it in politely appreciative nibbles. You throw yourself at it until there\u2019s nothing left. No menu layout can convey this quality, but when you find a restaurant that has it, you come back.\n           \n\n            The kitchen grinds sausages and grinds them well. One night, they were made from goat. If the words goat sausage conjure up a dry and wrinkled meat pouch, these were the opposite: pink, broad, juicy and gently spiced, offered up as a main course with a jammy tomato sauce and a bracing salad of dandelion leaves. Another night brought sweet pork sausages grilled then simmered, Portuguese style, with steamed clams, and very good.\n           \n\n            Houseman had an ideal late-summer dinner in its swordfish salad, a salade ni\u00e7oise by other means. Hunks of fish, poached and then packed in olive oil and sitting on a mat of tuna mayonnaise, were surrounded by little potatoes, string and shell beans, and some cherry tomatoes roasted so they collapsed on your tongue.\n           \n\n            The menu is top-heavy with appetizers. Like that swordfish main course, they lean on seasonal produce given a Mediterranean cast.\n           \n\n            Roasted peaches were yielding and honey-sweet alongside chopped hazelnuts, crumbs of feta and crinkles of grilled pancetta. Drippingly ripe tomatoes, real September beauties, were submitted to a fantastic Middle Eastern treatment of sesame seeds, cumin and parsley, underscored by the tingling sourness of sumac. A long, skinny eggplant, its grilled skin stripped off to expose its pale flesh, was dressed with bright-green basil oil and sat on a swirl of uncannily smooth and lemony tahini. Can tahini be luxurious? This was.\n           \n\n            Even the snacks, often pandering little throwaways, are worthwhile at Houseman. Salted fried favas, as brown and crunchy as a nut, are a cocktail-hour treat with a Pat Flynn (a rum and Coke you can drink without losing your self-respect). A soft-cooked egg, split and topped with capers, anchovies and fried leek threads, is a fine idea, too.\n           \n\n            Houseman\u2019s dining room, which has an upright, right-angled, vaguely New England look, provides enough traditional comforts that the scarcity of main courses on the menu seems out of character. Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Baumgart may offer so many more appetizers because they expect a lot of customers to make a meal of them. But when there are typically just four or five main courses, and one of these is a burger, the margin of error is small. Sometimes, Houseman falls outside it.\n           \n\n            That burger \u2014 two flat patties under melted cheese and a mushroom-onion topping \u2014 deserves a better bun than the flavorless and somewhat dry one it gets, especially at $17. (Crisp but preposterously salty fries cost an extra $2.) When a fillet of striped bass poached in court bouillon with clam juice is sold at $85 for two people, it shouldn\u2019t be as overcooked as mine was.\n           \n\n            The dessert menu, which comes to the table written on an abacus chalkboard, runs into the same trouble. One of just three slots was thrown away on a scoop of lackluster blackberry sorbet in a nest of broken-up celery sorbet. The celery was more intense than the blackberry, which did not make it a better dessert.\n           \n\n            It\u2019s lucky the other two choices were so good: a peanut tart that\u2019s like pecan pie without all the goo, and a sundae of wonderful malt ice cream with cherries in syrup.\n           \n\n            Houseman is still a young restaurant, with room to grow. A better hamburger bun should not be hard to come by. Already it gives you something that a lot of places never do: a sense that almost everything was cooked for a reason.\n           \n\n            Until recently, Mr. Baldwin was the chef de cuisine at\n            \n             Prune\n            \n            , which gives you the same sense. Prune\u2019s owner,\n            \n             Gabrielle Hamilton\n            \n            , was underrated as a chef for years because, I think, she never seems to invent anything in the kitchen. She isn\u2019t big on shotgun marriages of ingredients. But she understands the pleasure, part animal and part something else, that we take from food that is direct and honest.\n           \n\n            Many chefs have ideas about how to cook. The really good ones have ideas about how to eat. Ms. Hamilton does, and so do the two chefs at Houseman.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 132, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/30/dining/restaurant-review-houseman-in-hudson-square.html", "google_mag": 32.599998474121094}, {"review_text": "\n            David Sclarow built his first wood-burning pizza oven so he could feed guests at the wedding of two cheesemakers.

The third\n            \n             Pizza Moto\n            \n            oven was stolen last year, but he still has three others designed along the same lines.\n           \n\n            Clearly Mr. Sclarow is one of those chefs for whom half the fun is playing with fire, not to mention building the fire and a heatproof structure to contain it. When he was ready to open a stationary pizzeria in Brooklyn, a defunct Papa John\u2019s where pizzas were made in a gas oven would not seem to have held much appeal for him.\n           \n\n            Then he and his business partner, Anna Viertel, looked at the site, on the grim, shadowy, underpopulated borderland between Carroll Gardens and Red Hook. Behind the back wall was a large white-tiled oven from the late 19th\n            \n             -\n            \n            or early 20th century, sealed up and long forgotten.\n           \n\n            Would it take more than two years of restoration and modification to make the oven work again? Yes. Would Mr. Sclarow and Ms. Viertel undertake most of the masonry, plumbing, welding and electrical work themselves? Absolutely. Would there be a lot of red tape to cut through before the city would grant permits, and the restaurant would open in October? You bet.\n           \n\n            A perfect location, in other words.\n           \n\n            In the new restaurant, given the unwieldy full name\n            \n             Pizza Moto @ John Grace Bakery\n            \n            , Mr. Sclarow has room to stretch out. He has an imaginative bunch of appetizers that aren\u2019t bound by the conventions of pizzerias or even Italian restaurants. Most are pretty good, but there\u2019s more joy in the pizzas, which go well beyond the limited varieties of single-serving pies that sustain the outdoor operation.\n           \n\n            Those are without a doubt the best brick-oven pizzas a New Yorker can find in a schoolyard or park. But the pies at the new restaurant don\u2019t need any such qualification. Despite minor variability, the pies coming out of the old bakery are already among the top tier of New York brick-oven pizzas.\n           \n\n            The pizzas have grown to a 14-inch size you can share without scowling, and there are more of them. The clam pie is something like a flat clam chowder: It\u2019s topped with sliced potatoes and profoundly smoky bacon. But what makes it hard to put down is the flavor of clams cooked in cream and white wine that suffuses the whole thing.\n           \n\n            Another tomato-free pizza is a complex and compelling duet for cheese and fungus. It starts with a restrained application of ricotta, fontina, pecorino and mozzarella, which are covered with juicy, springy roasted mushrooms and feathery shaved raw ones.\n           \n\n            Tomato sauce underlies the very good pepperoni pizza (it\u2019s actually chorizo, slightly hotter, and tangy) and the \u201ceggs in hell\u201d pizza, which has bacon and mozzarella arrayed around the cyclopean eye of a single sous-vide egg. Chile oil makes the eggs in hell a more engaging bacon-and-eggs than the carbonara pizza, a special whose four cheeses melded into a single, not very interesting white blanket.\n           \n\n            The crust is in the modern Brooklyn-Neapolitan family exemplified by\n            \n             Franny\u2019s\n            \n            and\n            \n             Roberta\u2019s\n            \n            . Other doughs have a more complex flavor, but the one at Pizza Moto is far from bland. The highest bubbles on the sizable outer rim are starting to go black, and there are patches of char on the base. The crust is sturdy, but not brittle or tough. It crackles upon meeting your teeth, but its white interior is delicate, filled with small air pockets.\n           \n\n            Crackle is the entire point of the nonconformist pie that\u2019s sprinkled with salt, pepper and rosemary, and shellacked with bacon fat. Essentially a hot-pork-drenched cracker, it makes a superb appetizer if you can get over any narrow-minded hangups about eating two courses of pizza.\n           \n\n            At any rate, it\u2019s a better opening move than the freebie the kitchen sends out, a fried lasagna noodle coated with powdered cheese, tomatoes and pizza seasonings. It sounds more interesting than it is. But a similar frilly noodle, hand-pulled and boiled, was involved in the guinzaglio, one of the most fascinating and delicious appetizers I ate at Pizza Moto. Tossed in beef shank rag\u00f9, seasoned with fermented black beans, shiny with bone marrow, dressed with fried shallots, scallions and warm batons of celery, it managed to taste Chinese and Italian at the same time.\n           \n\n            Fried broccoli is about as crisp as fried broccoli can get, but it\u2019s supposed to be swiped in yuzu-kosho curd that is too cloying; it needs more spice. I would have liked the Caesar salad with smoked trout more if it hadn\u2019t struck me as a lesser version of the majestic herring Caesar at\n            \n             M. Wells Steakhouse\n            \n            . Toast spread with smoked swordfish whipped into a smooth brandade was lovely, though, perked up with pickled onions and dotted with poppy seeds.\n           \n\n            The restaurant currently won\u2019t take reservations for parties of fewer than five. This isn\u2019t an unusual policy, but here the result is that smaller groups, even when they arrive early, can end up staring at the two big empty tables and the wall art \u2014 lightboxes made from vintage pinball playfields \u2014 for a long while.\n           \n\n            Cocktails, which have stiff spines, can make the clock tick faster; so can the fine domestic beers. The two Italian wines I tried were less focused.\n           \n\n            One night as I waited to be seated, I was parked at a table in the kitchen, under a collection of high-minded cookbooks. The table has a great view of the oven, and the real estate agent who rented the space was sitting next to me, which is how I heard the story of its discovery.\n           \n\n            Another night I idled at the bar on a leather stool with legs of bent chrome-plated pipe. I had never seen ones quite like them. Later I\u2019d learn that Mr. Sclarow had\n            \n             cut and welded the pipes\n            \n\n            from some old school desks he had found, matching their height to the bar of soapstone tiles he had pulled out of a Dumpster.\n           \n\n            Are there easier ways to open a pizzeria? Sure. Would any of them have resulted in anything resembling Pizza Moto?

One of the most strenuous competitors is a guy at the next table who\u2019s staring down the woman across from him while giving her a ferocious, what-big-teeth-you-have grin. I\u2019d call his expression carnivorous, but we\u2019re at\n            \n             Nix\n            \n            , and there\u2019s nothing to eat here but vegetables.\n           \n\n            Not long ago, vegetarian restaurants in the United States were the last place you\u2019d expect to see people who looked as if they couldn\u2019t wait to go home and have non-tantric sex. The mood in their dining rooms could be tranquil, convalescent, earth-motherly, doctrinaire or ascetic, but rarely did it ripple with the energy of hookups in progress.\n           \n\n            The crackle in the air at Nix and other recent meatless restaurants is what you get when you liberate vegetables from vegetarianism. Stripped of ideology, Nix is freed up for hedonic pursuits.\n           \n\n            Sure, plants contain nutrients. But the people drinking Nix martinis probably aren\u2019t doing it because they hope the oils left on the vodka\u2019s surface by a thyme branch will boost their supplies of omega-3 fatty acids.\n           \n\n            Nor are the anti-inflammatory benefits of crucifers likely to be top of mind as they eat the cauliflower tempura. More likely, they are flashing back to the last time they sat on the floor eating Chinese food out of a takeout box. The fried cauliflower has been submerged in a sauce that tastes like spicy ketchup. Poppy seeds on top make a small but real contribution when one of these orange grenades of crunch and heat is stuffed, along with a pickle slice, into the soft, white half-moon of a steamed bun.\n           \n\n            The chefs lobbing those orange grenades at this four-month-old restaurant in Greenwich Village are Nicolas Farias and John Fraser. Mr. Fraser\u2019s meatless menus at\n            \n             Dovetail\n            \n            , his home base on the Upper West Side, are much talked about. Stronger demonstrations of his wit and resourcefulness, his ability to treat vegetables like meat without seeming to be pulling a scam, are the spit-roasted beets and the coffee-laced carrots Wellington at\n            \n             Narcissa\n            \n            , his more casual restaurant in the Standard East Village hotel.\n           \n\n            One of Mr. Fraser\u2019s collaborators at Narcissa is\n            \n             James Truman\n            \n            , a partner at Nix. That\u2019s him in the pressed suit and rumpled hair at the end of the bar. He recognizes me, too. Before he got into the restaurant business, we used to run into each other at the parties of friends we have in common.\n           \n\n            As an editor at Cond\u00e9 Nast and later its editorial director, he used to worry about helping magazines see around corners. This approach informs Nix, which among other things is an attempt to locate the future of vegetable-centered dining. The white walls and other interior features, designed by the architect\n            \n             Elizabeth Roberts\n            \n            , have a low-key simplicity, and candlelight gives them a bit of mystery.\n           \n\n            The details don\u2019t scream to be noticed. You have to look closely to see that the lamp bases are the twisted roots of old junipers. Understatement is, of course, flattering to the observer who picks up on it, which may explain why Nix seems to draw the upper crust of the downtown creative class, people with interesting jewelry and significant haircuts.\n           \n\n            I was hypnotized like a cobra by the patterns in the vintage dresses purchased for the hosts; the dyed cotton smocks designed by\n            \n             Paul Marlow\n            \n            for the female servers; and Mr. Marlow\u2019s print dresses, one for each night of the week, worn by the wine director, Andrea Morris. But lavishing\n            \n             all this care\n            \n            on the women\u2019s costumes while the male servers slink like ninjas in simple dark shirts and jeans can border on the fetishistic.\n           \n\n            Ms. Morris\u2019s wine list also avoids the obvious. She has an Alsatian Chasselas, an Edelzwicker from Oregon and a lithe Pelaverga from the Piedmont, which Mr. Truman sold me one night as the product of a \u201cbanished grape.\u201d (In fact, it has D.O.C. status in the Verduno area of the region.) Staying away from name brands has another benefit: keeping the prices on almost every bottle under $100. More like this, please.\n           \n\n            Editors occasionally follow their instincts right out the window. I think Mr. Truman has done this with the restaurant\u2019s name. It comes from an 1893 Supreme Court decision,\n            \n             Nix v. Hedden\n            \n            , which held that tomatoes were a vegetable and thus subject to an import tax that did not apply to fruit.\n           \n\n            Mr. Truman also liked the look of the word with its\n            \n             \u201cthree strong letters.\u201d\n            \n            What seems not to have entered the calculations, although it will occur to parents of school-age children and to any search engine, is that these three strong letters are also used by\n            \n             an over-the-counter delousing treatment\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            Now let\u2019s eat!\n           \n\n            I highly recommend starting with a wheel of flatbread baked in the tandoor, and a cup of raw young vegetables or one of the dips. The red-pepper walnut spread is a wonderful take on muhammara, while the crushed avocado with mint and chai curry powder is fun because it looks like guacamole and isn\u2019t.\n           \n\n            In the part of the menu labeled \u201clighter,\u201d I like the little carrots baked in parchment with spices and bulgur very much. Tomato water, buzzed with fresh green chile rings, is so entrancing that it even made the mung beans bobbing in it taste good, although its higher purpose is to perk up a charred half of an avocado.\n           \n\n            In one salad, spears of Persian cucumber are splashed with a jerk sauce that\u2019s coaxed back from the brink of too-muchness by crumbled goat cheese and, in an inspired touch, sliced kumquats. In another, jicama is shaved into what the menu calls ribbons. They\u2019re more like seatbelts, and the dressing of blood oranges and Fresno peppers can\u2019t quite get a grip on them.\n           \n\n            The menu\u2019s third section is called \u201cbolder.\u201d Here you will find the fried cauliflower buns and shiitake mushrooms sauced, very effectively, as if they were pasta cacio e pepe and spooned over creamy, rough-grained polenta. There\u2019s a bowl of stir-fried brown rice that, once it\u2019s stirred up with nori, chanterelles and a runny egg, reminds me of bibimbap.\n           \n\n            Very occasionally, I wished the vegetables had been allowed to relax a little. Artichokes shouldn\u2019t have to compete with broccoli rabe, tomato sauce and ricotta. Pur\u00e9ed sweet potato gets the right sauce, a pumpkinseed mole, but the line of reasoning that led the kitchen to pack the pur\u00e9e into rubbery balloons of tofu skin should be re-examined.\n           \n\n            Servers tell you at the outset of the meal that if you want to finish with the quartered pineapple roasted for 20 minutes in the tandoor, then brushed with tamarind glaze, you should order it early. This is sound advice.\n           \n\n            They won\u2019t tell you that if you finish the whole thing, you may never make it to the rest of Italivi Reboreda\u2019s dessert menu, including the dark and tender chocolate cake that is wrapped, jelly-roll-style, around chocolate mousse. But I will.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 134, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/dining/nix-restaurant-review-greenwich-village.html", "google_mag": 23.600000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n            When word went around almost six years ago that Masayoshi Takayama was going to bring\n            \n             one of his Las Vegas restaurants, Tetsu,\n            \n            to TriBeCa, I can\u2019t say that my heart began to pound to\n            \n             the bongo beat of \u201cViva Las Vegas.\u201d\n            \n            In fact, I braced for the worst.\n           \n\n            Eating in that city can be a wild ride, but the dining rooms often have an oversize, mall-like scale and the menus a safe, something-for-everyone vagueness \u2014 qualities that, transplanted to New York, can be real buzzkills. As far as restaurants go, what happens in Vegas should usually stay in Vegas.\n           \n\n            But a lot has happened in the past six years. Some is too painful to recount, but luckily not the story of the\n            \n             Tetsu\n            \n            on Leonard Street, which finally opened in November.\n           \n\n            It has little in common with the Nevada iteration, which\n            \n             will close in April\n            \n            . The animating idea there was teppanyaki, sizzled on flattop steel grills set into big half-moon tables that cooks stood behind, like blackjack dealers. But Mr. Takayama dropped that notion in Manhattan; now his menu is dominated by food prepared on robata grills operated behind a dining counter, supplemented widely by other techniques: raw seafood, soups, slaws, fried stuff.\n           \n\n            The roomy, half-empty white-and-beige interior of the casino Tetsu looks nothing like the shadowy and thickly settled Leonard Street Tetsu. Iron columns, steel seats, brick walls and wood floorboards give the place the look of an after-hours downtown lounge from a few years ago, before Industrial got self-conscious and became Steampunk.\n           \n\n            The prices are also much lower than they were in Las Vegas, or in a sample menu Mr. Takayama floated for TriBeCa in 2012. Only a handful of items on the two-page dinner menu cost more than $20. Can this be the same chef who collects $595 a person, before tax, for dinner at\n            \n             Masa\n            \n            ? Who sells a bowl of chopped tuna belly with caviar for $68 next door at\n            \n             BarMasa\n            \n            and $78 at\n            \n             Kappo Masa\n            \n            , across town?\n           \n\n            One and the same. True, Tetsu specializes in small plates, but then none of Mr. Takayama\u2019s other restaurants are particularly known for supersizing. What Tetsu does differently is to put away the luxury ingredients that are so central to Masa\u2019s experience and image. At last, New York has a chance to see just how good Mr. Takayama is when he isn\u2019t hiding behind truffles and caviar.\n           \n\n            He can, in fact, make less expensive seafood taste as precious as sturgeon roe. During the bay scallop season, which has an annoying habit of ending before I have eaten enough of them, Tetsu seared them with skinny lengths of asparagus and sent them out with garlic-anchovy oil and lime juice, simmering in a hot bowl. I will be marking this on the calendar so I don\u2019t miss it next winter. For now there is a similar dish that operates on the same principle: tender, palm-size whole octopus sizzled in butter and lime with garlic, chopped cilantro and strands of a green Korean chile.\n           \n\n            The biggest surprise was how much I liked the salads. The menu calls them slaws, which goes a long way toward repairing some of the injuries that word has absorbed over the decades. There is a superb one with fresh kale and fried burdock in an unexpectedly Southeast Asian lemongrass dressing, and another of cabbage and roasted duck stirred with, yes, mayonnaise. (No supermarket mayo, it\u2019s flavored with fresh orange juice and sherry vinegar.) If there was yuzu in the yuzu-daikon slaw, though, it had walked off the job the night I tried it.\n           \n\n            Items from the robata, supposedly the heart of the restaurant, were more variable than you would hope. My table went quietly wild for the soy-marinated quail eggs and the pink pork sausage with flecks of yellow and green Thai chiles. Skewered coconut shrimp received polite nods.\n           \n\n            When you get the menu, though, your eyes will automatically go straight to the raw seafood, and they probably should. It appears twice, the first time in chilled appetizers that can share some of Masa\u2019s delicacy and subtle use of spice. Speckles of finely minced jalape\u00f1os dot little pearly pink bites of hamachi; in a more ordinary case, wasabi has been quickly grated over hunks of yellowfin tuna with a spoonful of simple guacamole.\n           \n\n            Raw seafood reappears at the end of the menu as hand rolls and nigiri. Here I have a confession to make: Almost all of my outer-stratosphere moments at Masa happened before the barrage of sushi that ends the meal. Near the end of the game comes a mesmerizing hand roll stuffed with meltingly fatty tuna belly, but the nigiri on its own it would probably not land Masa in my top tier of sushi destinations.\n           \n\n            That is roughly my feeling about the sushi at Tetsu. Although the contrast there is less extreme, its nigiri can be inconsistent and is best employed as a short and satisfying last stop, not as the main event.\n           \n\n            Should you forge on to dessert, you\u2019ll find that the pastry chef (Matthew O\u2019Haver, who doubles as the service director) does outstanding work: a plate-wide slice of grilled olive oil cake next to a thick stripe of tangy mascarpone; a brownielike chocolate cake made with black-sesame paste and topped with a powerfully appealing miso-caramel sauce; a green-peppercorn ice cream that clamps fire and ice together in a single rich scoop.\n           \n\n            At lunch, the menu is snipped from two pages to one. A little bit is subtracted from each category and two new ones are added: burgers and bowls of squiggly yellow ramen. The ramens are a little smaller and more refined than usual, which may not be top priorities for the average ramen fiend. But given how low in salt and fat they were, relatively speaking, I was impressed by how much flavor made its way into the miso ramen with chashu and the shoyu ramen with very, very good braised short rib.\n           \n\n            Tetsu\u2019s burgers are cooked in a heated metal contraption with spikes that pierce the meat. Mr. Takayama designed it. I have not seen it, but it sounds like an iron maiden for the stovetop. The spikes are supposed to heat the interior, but the two burgers I\u2019ve had were very rare with a notably dark sear. But the results were very different. I had an immediate, lingering, intensely positive reaction to the lamb burger under melted taleggio, but I would not order the underseasoned and pulpy beef burger with Cheddar again.\n           \n\n            The kitchen may also need more practice on the skinny fries \u2014 \u201cTetsu fries\u201d. Once they were gold and cooked to a fine crackle; another time they were ghostly pale and limp.\n           \n\n            The lunch service is new and still fairly quiet. Dinner, though, can be a racket. If it\u2019s just you, or you and a friend, sitting at the long counter made from a single plank of bubinga wood offers the best shot at privacy. Placed at one of the communal tables in back one night, I ended up next to a group that kept rowdily showing off its expensive wines.\n           \n\n            Viva Manhattan, I guess?\n           \n\n            \u2605\u2605\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 137, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/dining/tetsu-review-tribeca-masayoshi-takayama.html", "google_mag": 25.5}, {"review_text": "\n            I had eaten approximately 300 miles of cold sesame noodles before I knew they had a story. If I\u2019d thought about them at all, I would have reflected that everything has a story, but I didn\u2019t. Back in the 1980s, when I came to New York, they were simply a thing you had to order with Chinese takeout because somebody always wanted them, even though they usually tasted like leftover spaghetti with Skippy.\n           \n\n            Before this, though, cold sesame noodles in New York were the specialty of one particular Sichuan-born chef, Yu Fa Tang. Called Shorty by everybody, Tang came here in the early \u201960s after working for more than a decade in Taiwan. By 1967 he had his own restaurant on East Broadway, Hwa Yuan Szechuan Inn, where among other renditions of Sichuanese food he made cold sesame noodles that would lodge themselves in the memories of generations of New Yorkers and be imitated, lamentably, by takeout cooks all over town. At its peak it reportedly went through 500 pounds of noodles a day.\n           \n\n            For more details on the background of the dish and its life after the restaurant closed, I refer you to\n            \n             a 2007 treatise that Sam Sifton wrote in The New York Times Magazine\n            \n            . For a taste of the original and unexpurgated recipe, I refer you to the very good new restaurant that opened on the site of the original in October. Its name now shortened to\n            \n             Hwa Yuan Szechuan\n            \n            , it is worth visiting for reasons that go well beyond nostalgia.\n           \n\n            Hwa Yuan is an imposing restaurant, built by Shorty\u2019s son Chien Lieh Tang and his grandson James Tang to plant the family name solidly in this century. To the left of the entrance is a lounge where translucent backlit panels cast everything in a streaked-marmalade glow. Straight ahead is the first dining room, and there are more up the stairs to the right.\n           \n\n            The tables sit under white cloths, and the places are set with white china traced with gold. To the right of the plates are two pairs of chopsticks on a white-china rest, one for serving and the other for eating.\n           \n\n            Needless to say, the cold sesame noodles are mandatory, at least on a first visit. They are, for one thing, truly cold. Not left-out-on-the-counter cold, but trickling-mountain-spring cold. The temperature accentuates their smooth surface and, like the slivers of cucumber, makes the small zap of chile oil call out more clearly. The first time I ate them the sauce needed a little more salt and vinegar, but the next time it had a finely balanced tension. If you know only the sugary peanut-butter imitation, tasting Hwa Yuan\u2019s original must be like hearing Van Morrison for the first time when you\u2019ve grown up on Ed Sheeran.\n           \n\n            Chien Lieh Tang is the chef at the resurrected Hwa Yuan, and although his cooking is not hard to appreciate, a little orientation may help. First, a warning: Those who believe that the only good Sichuan food makes you weep, sniffle, moan, call 911 or crawl under the table will need to adjust their standards. Hwa Yuan serves many family recipes that reflect an earlier stage of Sichuan cooking and Shorty Tang\u2019s time in Taiwan. While chiles are often present, they rarely dominate. Nor does the kitchen try to lard extra umami into every dish. The best food at Hwa Yuan tries to impress through charm, not arm-twisting.\n           \n\n            Family pride being the point here, dishes that carry the names Tang or Hwa Yuan tend to be excellent. Not, I\u2019m afraid, the Hwa Yuan dry-aged shell steak, which got impressive flavor from basting with marrow but was knotted with tough membranes when I tried it.\n           \n\n            But Tang\u2019s Amazing Spicy Wine Chicken was a treat, very tender hunks of dark meat in a delicate sauce of Shaoxing rice wine, bean paste and chile oil. Tang\u2019s Amazing Tofu was a minor discovery, seared squares of pressed tofu with fresh green chiles in a sauce that\u2019s more interesting than you\u2019d guess from its pale tan color. Hot Tang Tang noodles may sound like cold sesame noodles run through the microwave; they are something completely different, short strands of noodle in a steaming cup of sour-and-spicy broth that has a businesslike edge of roasted dried chiles.\n           \n\n            And Whole Fish with Hot Bean Sauce, Tang Family Creation is a bona fide star, the dish I know I\u2019ll order again even if I\u2019m not in the mood for cold noodles. It had a devoted following at the original restaurant, where it was made with carp. Now it is barramundi, precisely cooked and resting in a rusty mash of chile oil, fermented soybeans and chopped scallions. It\u2019s a forceful dish that\u2019s still noteworthy for its balance.\n           \n\n            As for the Hwa Yuan crab cake, I have no idea whether it lives up to the name. The kitchen was always out of it, along with such other intrigues as duck liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 and foie gras with fruit.\n           \n\n            The other major warning: My Peking duck did not deserve the fanfare it gets on the menu, where it is called Beijing duck. I phoned ahead to reserve a duck and a half for a large group, was told on arrival that the half duck wasn\u2019t available, settled for the whole duck, and found that it wasn\u2019t worth ordering in advance, or the $65 it cost. The carving was imprecise enough to make me glad it was only a roast duck under the knife and not a heart-surgery patient, and while the meat was juicy, pink and flavorful, the skin was flabby and as crisp as boiled spinach.\n           \n\n            Less heralded menu entries warrant a look, though. There is no reason to believe that soup dumplings, which arrived in New York by way of Shanghai long after Shorty Tang\u2019s heyday, will be any good at Hwa Yuan. They are. So are the thick and juicy pan-fried dumplings.\n           \n\n            I can never resist snow-pea shoots, and have never come across any as delicious as Hwa Yuan\u2019s. The dry-saut\u00e9ed string beans are about average, but stir-fried brussels sprouts with bacon is a rewarding variation on Sichuanese cabbage with pork.\n           \n\n            Sichuan cooks seem to have a special understanding of potatoes, which may explain why the little marble-size ones here, cooked kung pao style with peanuts and dried chiles, are so unusually good.\n           \n\n            I hope to fake my way into reproducing the dish at home, which would make me the latest in a long line of Hwa Yuan imitators.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 138, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/dining/hwa-yuan-szechuan-review-chinese-food.html", "google_mag": 24.399999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n            Among his other innovations,\n            \n             Grant Achatz\n            \n            is a pioneer in menu typography. At\n            \n             Alinea\n            \n            , in Chicago, courses on his tasting menus used to be printed in a long, snaking column; sweeter dishes drifted out to the right margin and more savory ones swayed left.\n           \n\n            At\n            \n             the Aviary\n            \n            , the willfully atypical cocktail lounge he founded in Chicago in 2011, the name of each drink is preceded by a bird silhouette like the ones on the endpapers of\n            \n             Roger Tory Peterson\u2019s field guides\n            \n            . The nearer the silhouette is to the name, the more the cocktail will resemble something Nick and Nora Charles would have recognized. The farther away the bird, the weirder the drink.\n           \n\n            During my first flight at the Aviary\u2019s\n            \n             new Manhattan incarnation\n            \n            , my server pointed to the entry for Bring Another Smurf, a mezcal and coconut drink. \u201cIf you look over here,\u201d he said, sliding his finger left, \u201cthe bird is all the way out.\u201d\n           \n\n            Is a cocktail improved when its bird is all the way out? The question pecked at me each time the elevator let me out on the 35th floor of the Mandarin Oriental New York, site of\n            \n             the Aviary NYC\n            \n            and its quieter, shadow-filled sibling,\n            \n             the Office NYC\n            \n            . It also is originally from Chicago, where Mr. Achatz and his partner, Nick Kokonas, have built one superb, genre-bending establishment after another.\n           \n\n            For years they have flirted with New York. It took a hotel deal to get them here. The cloned Aviary and Office are undeniably expressions of Mr. Achatz\u2019s aesthetic, with his fondness for Rube Goldberg devices, audience participation, old ideas tilted off their usual axis and novel ideas launched into orbit.\n           \n\n            The wildest notions are reserved for drinks in the Aviary. Mr. Achatz\u2019s food plays second fiddle in both rooms, and plays it beautifully. Yet neither space really shows off his full powers. In this perch above Central Park, the bird is half out \u2014 or, if you look at a different way, half in.\n           \n\n            Like many Aviary drinks, the one called Science A.F. (ostensibly a reference to the microbiologist Alexander Fleming) is made at the table. A small blue flame compels Scotch and other ingredients in the lower chamber of a vacuum coffee maker to ascend to an upper chamber filled with fruit tea, as dry-ice fog carpets the table. This took about five minutes and produced something that tasted like the fruit punch that might be served at a convention for designated drivers.\n           \n\n            It does not quite give you your bird\u2019s worth, I think. On the other hand, I admired the balance and complexity of the Wake and Bake, a mutant rye manhattan made with coffee- and orange-flavored vermouth. What I can\u2019t imagine ever loving is being asked by a server to stick my head inside the inflated plastic bag in which it is served, to see that it really did smell like an everything bagel. It did, but it was one of several moments when I felt like a parent helping the Aviary staff to complete a project for the science fair.\n           \n\n            After a round or two, the alert drinker may become gun-shy. A friend I\u2019d invited for lunch gamely sipped a Boom Goes the Dynamite, which had never cooled below tepid despite having fumed vigorously from the dry ice inside its laboratory flask. Leaving a third undrunk, she asked for a Bloody Mary.\n           \n\n            \u201cOur Bloody Mary is very unique,\u201d our server said brightly. \u201cIt takes about 15, 20 minutes to make.\u201d\n           \n\n            \u201cIs it served ... cold?\u201d my friend asked, hope flickering weakly in her voice.\n           \n\n            It was. A few minutes later, a relatively traditional Bloody was poured over many tiny ice marbles inside the bowl of what looked like a small spittoon. Around the spittoon\u2019s broad brim were arranged five garnishes, or side dishes, or condiments, including chopped razor clam with celery sorbet and a little pillbox of horseradish jelly.\n           \n\n            When we were alone again, she sighed and said, \u201cI was hoping for a glass.\u201d The Aviary\u2019s Bloody Mary, by the way, costs $38.\n           \n\n\n\n            We had come to try the daytime menu the Aviary recently introduced after two months or so of nighttime-only business.\n           \n\n            While the drinks gave us a bumpy ride, all was smooth once we embarked on the three-course, $45 lunch, starting with a roasted squash soup and a salad. Both had pieces of fruit and vegetable that had somehow been talked into tasting like more than they were. Finally there was a sandwich of fried, buttermilk- and yuzu-brined chicken thigh with pickles and shredded iceberg lettuce on a bun with more sesame seeds to the square inch than I\u2019ve ever seen. The dressing was a toasted sesame sauce, and, like everything else about the sandwich, it was excellent.\n           \n\n            Apart from a fried pork rind the size of a dish towel, the items on the evening menu are generally wispy: a single, wonderful tempura shrimp with slices of yuzu-scented pear; an octopus croquette under streamers of bonito. There is\n            \n             one of Mr. Achatz\u2019s earliest inventions\n            \n            , the raviolo filled to the bursting point with black-truffle broth. It is still a marvel. There was only one dish I did not like, but boy, did I not like it: cold pork belly in a bland goo of banana curry, sandwiched between flat discs of iceberg lettuce.\n           \n\n            These plates run from $11 to $29. Two or three would make for an interesting postcard from the inside of Mr. Achatz\u2019s head. Ordering the whole roster would leave you a couple hundred dollars poorer and no wiser, though. The menu is not designed for that kind of eating.\n           \n\n            Neither is the Aviary, although it\u2019s hard to say just what it is designed for. Deals between chefs and hotels invariably entail compromise, but Mr. Achatz and Mr. Kokonas may have given up too much here.\n           \n\n            Sunk a few steps below the hotel lobby and dominated by a view of the Central Park skyline, the space is an awkward combination of destination and waiting room. Achatz devotees who paid for their spots weeks earlier through Mr. Kokonas\u2019s reservations and guest-tracking service,\n            \n             Tock\n            \n            , may find themselves at curved leather lounge chairs next to hotel guests taking phone calls between meetings.\n           \n\n            There\u2019s no sense of arrival, nothing to suggest you\u2019re entering the domain of a restaurant group that has always refused to do things the usual way.\n           \n\n\n\n            You do get that sense when you enter the Office. The Chicago Office is downstairs from the Aviary; in New York it is behind a wooden door just past the Aviary\u2019s cocktail-assembly station. Suddenly faceless hotel luxury gives way to a den of leather club chairs, parquet floors, clothbound books, manual typewriters, contemporary art, eccentric antiques.\n           \n\n            The two Offices are usually called speakeasies. This one looks to me more like the library of stately Wayne Manor.\n           \n\n            The theme is tradition. This being an Achatz project, the theme is pushed to its limits and beyond. Micah Melton, the beverage director of both lounges (in both cities), scours auctions and private sales for old bottles of spirits. Some of the older ones go here for $500 an ounce or more, straight up. Others are mixed into what the menu calls \u201cdusty bottle cocktails.\u201d\n           \n\n            As a way to get rid of money, this is both alluring and appalling. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to order a $475 old-fashioned stirred from bourbon bottled in 1969. But I couldn\u2019t resist learning what happens when 75 grams of shaved truffle soak in a bottle of Chartreuse. (It\u2019s fascinating, but not more delicious than untruffled Chartreuse.)\n           \n\n            The short food menu appears to have been printed by letterpress. On it are a number of time-honored plutocratic pleasures, such as cold oysters, foie gras terrine, and a really fine and forcefully seasoned tartare of ivory-veined rib-eye.\n           \n\n            Steamed mussels in cream with leeks and bacon are $35. If any pot of mussels is worth that much money, this is it. Vegetable crudit\u00e9s may sound like nothing. They\u2019re very much something, a miniature forest of fruits and vegetables treated this way and that, then set on chipped ice with a dip \u2014 a harmonious, understated vadouvan-squash cream the last time I went.\n           \n\n            The contortions that Mr. Melton and Mr. Achatz put liquor through at the Aviary are as imaginative as cuisine gets; they probably have more freedom than they would if the place were a restaurant. But rather than asking how a Bloody Mary, say, can be improved, or what its essence is, they seem to ask: How would the Aviary serve it?\n           \n\n            The answer always seems to require equipment. The bird-all-the-way-out drinks especially are like elaborate magic tricks with metal boxes into which the beautiful assistant will vanish. Somehow, the boxes upstage the assistant. The cocktails at the Office are more like close-up card tricks. My favorite is: Mix me a drink and I\u2019ll make it disappear.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 139, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/dining/grant-achatz-office-aviary-review.html", "google_mag": 40.5}, {"review_text": "\n         Wylie Dufresne was sitting at the end of the bar. In about three weeks he would open\n         \n          another restaurant\n         \n         of his own, but he had given himself a night off to check out somebody else\u2019s, Manzanilla. Its chef and owner is Dani Garc\u00eda, a big deal in Andalusia and, as the first guy to bring liquid nitrogen into the kitchen, a member in good standing of the modernist sorcerers\u2019 club. At his flagship restaurant,\n         \n          Calima\n         \n         in Marbella, Mr. Garc\u00eda makes\n         \n          trompe l\u2019oeil tomatoes\n         \n         and fashions chocolate butterflies with mango wings. Simply by opening Manzanilla, his first restaurant outside Spain, on East 26th Street, he has drastically increased the number of chefs in town with whom Mr. Dufresne might conceivably swap recipes.\n        \n\n\n          Manzanilla\n         \n         looks like a grand entrance for Mr. Garc\u00eda. For one thing, he and his co-owner, Yann de Rochefort, acquired some serious real estate. Their dining room is as big as a barn, roomy enough that you can walk to your table without turning sideways and holding your breath, although this barn has that overdressed look that is achieved by handing over money to a Manhattan design firm (in this case,\n         \n          Meyer Davis Studio\n         \n         ) and asking for something rustic. Quibble about the d\u00e9cor if you like, but it is not every day that downtown gets a major restaurant from a serious chef with enough seats that 8 p.m. reservations are not out of the question.\n        \n\n         As Mr. Garc\u00eda\u2019s introduction to New Yorkers, though, Manzanilla extends something less than a firm handshake. Apart from some terrific, how-did-he-do-it desserts, it does not show off the kinds of techniques that might intrigue Mr. Dufresne. That is not a problem in itself; dining on the cutting edge carries the danger of cuts and scratches. But some dishes that ought to be free of risks are not, and the strain of running a kitchen in an unfamiliar city occasionally shows.\n        \n\n         At its best, which is about half the time, Manzanilla offers some very welcome takes on Spanish tradition. Here are six strong arguments for taking a seat at the bar, or a table. One: the tortillita gaditana, an amazingly airy wafer with tiny shrimp in their shells embedded in a batter made with powdered dried shrimp, which gives it the intense shellfish flavor better known from Southeast Asia. The snack is a specialty of C\u00e1diz, although\n         \n          Mr. Garc\u00eda\n         \n         smartly bends Andalusian tradition by pairing it with a kimchi mayonnaise.\n        \n\n         Two: the cuttlefish croquettes, breaded globes of seafood stew that are black with squid ink and preposterously rich with b\u00e9chamel. The center should not hold; it is too liquid and soft. But it does, bound by a crunchy, golden crust.\n        \n\n         Three: tomato tartare, toast spread with a deep red pulp made from fresh, canned and sun-dried tomatoes; the top is beaded with the fresh, bright interior jelly that holds the seeds. If you\u2019ve been avoiding tomatoes since the summer, this is a reason to close your eyes and remember how delicious they can be, even in springtime.\n        \n\n         Four and five: the two main courses made with creamy, short-grained bomba rice. One is called black rice, a more substantial remix of the cuttlefish croquettes, and the other is vegetarian, with zucchini and squash blossoms bringing a springlike freshness to meaty wild mushrooms that are cooked with al dente rice.\n        \n\n         Six: the top loin of sweet Ib\u00e9rico pork given a Japanese marinade of sake, mirin and miso; it is sliced like steak and just as satisfyingly meaty, maybe more so. Oh, all right, seven: except for the gray and underseasoned testa, the Ib\u00e9rico charcuterie plate is a joy, with two kinds of cured loin, lean and marbled; strips of seductive lardo; and best of all, marvelous ham with a border of fat that really does melt on your tongue.\n        \n\n         All of these are exceptional additions to the growing catalog of great Spanish tastes in New York. But Manzanilla had nearly as many dishes that were not in the same league.\n        \n\n         The whites of quail eggs, cold and runny, made a promising kale salad deeply unappealing. The sharp tang and tiny curds of a layer of goat cheese canceled out the smooth sweetness of a foie gras terrine. Beet-orange sauce and tomatillo gazpacho were lost on a platter of two varieties of raw oysters, neither very flavorful. If the menu hadn\u2019t said so, I\u2019m not sure I would know that the bland log of white meat that broke into wet splinters was chicken.\n        \n\n         There was nothing wrong with a tender braised lamb shank in a sticky reduction, but little about it pointed to a chef of Mr. Garc\u00eda\u2019s skills. And the best thing about a thin plank of New York strip cooked on a plancha were the flakes of sea salt on top.\n        \n\n         On top of other dishes: spheres. Here a sphere, there a sphere, everywhere a sphere. Spherification, a process\n         \n          developed at El Bulli\n         \n         , captures a liquid inside a thin membrane that bursts open on the tongue. Mr. Garc\u00eda spherifies so many things that his restaurant is in danger of becoming a theme park of modern Spanish gastronomy. Spheres of olive juice brought a superfluous brininess to the charcuterie, which was salty enough on its own. Little spheres of mignonette sat on two of the oysters, and big spheres of citrus dressing swamped raw slices of sea bass.\n        \n\n         Mr. Garc\u00eda\u2019s chops are put to far more compelling and delicious use in the dessert course. A stunningly good and custardy rice pudding is dotted with kernels of freeze-dried raspberry, yogurt and white chocolate, the kind of surprise you wish you could still get out of children\u2019s cereal. A whole bag of tricks is applied to a barely frozen dessert Mr. Garc\u00eda calls a pineapple iceberg but which looks more like a tall slice of yellow meringue in a pool of passion-fruit and yogurt custard. Close your mouth and the iceberg collapses into a contented swoon of cool tropical froth.\n        \n\n         There\u2019s also this silver egg \u2014 not a sphere, an egg \u2014 called Marbella\u2019s Full Moon. A white chocolate shell filled with white chocolate mousse and a yolk-colored citrus jelly, it is at once a technical wonder, a visual gem and a very good thing to eat.\n        \n\n         Maybe Manzanilla is underestimating New Yorkers\u2019 appetite for the best of current Spanish cooking. That might account for the kitchen\u2019s occasional lack of conviction and the proliferating spheres. The moon may be full in Marbella. It would be wonderful to see it shine in Manhattan, too.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 140, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-manzanilla-in-manhattan.html", "google_mag": 27.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n         The regulars at Randazzo\u2019s Clam Bar know what to order. I was still learning the ropes, though, so I invited suggestions.\n        \n\n         My server\u2019s advice was quick and definitive. \u201cGet the calama\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re here.\u201d\n        \n\n         Strictly speaking, the fried calamari was not the reason I had driven down Ocean Avenue in Brooklyn until it dead-ended at the white row of fishing ships and booze-cruise leviathans on Sheepshead Bay, then parked in front of the neon lobster with the name Randazzo\u2019s pinched between its upheld claws.\n        \n\n         No, it was the Sauce.\n        \n\n\n          Randazzo\u2019s\n         \n         makes any number of tomato sauces, but only one Sauce. It has two speeds, spicy and medium, but the dark, intense, concentrated, oregano-accented essence is the same. The tomatoes cook down for an eternity and then some, until they are as deeply caramelized as a pan of fried sausage and onions.\n        \n\n         The Sauce can be ladled on hot or chilled lobster, on fried shrimp, on steamed mussels or on chopped scungilli, where it works a particularly satisfying alchemy. And of course, it is poured over floured and fried calamari. A pure distillation of Italian-American cuisine, the Sauce tastes as if a chemical analysis would reveal the blueprint for every great dish in every red-sauce joint in the country.\n        \n\n         I found many other things to like at Randazzo\u2019s, but yes, the Sauce was the reason I was there. It is the reason\n         \n          many people were devastated\n         \n         when the restaurant was destroyed by\n         \n          Hurricane Sandy\n         \n         last October, and the reason they cheered when it reopened just before Christmas.\n        \n\n         And, in a sense, the Sauce is the reason Randazzo\u2019s is there in the first place. Decades ago, when the boats leaving Sheepshead Bay each morning carried men who fished for their living, the Randazzo family owned a seafood shop and a bar on Emmons Avenue. As a cheap bar snack, they handed out fried squid, which back then was more likely to be found on the end of a hook than the end of a fork, along with Helen Randazzo\u2019s long-simmered Sauce.\n        \n\n         \u201cThey would cut the bar down a little every year and put in tables, because more people would be sitting down,\u201d said Helen\u2019s oldest grandson, Paul Randazzo. In 1964, the bar graduated to a clam bar with a menu of six items, not counting the Sauce.\n        \n\n         As the mounds of cherrystone shells grew, so did\n         \n          the family business\n         \n         , adding on a formal Italian restaurant that served pasta, broiled seafood and other Helen Randazzo recipes. When it closed in 1994, it bequeathed those dishes to the clam bar.\n        \n\n         They are still on the menu today for customers who look beyond the Sauce.\n         \n          Marcella Hazan\n         \n         may rap me on the knuckles with her cheese grater for this, but I am crazy about Randazzo\u2019s shrimp parmigiana. The restaurant buys wild shrimp netted in the Gulf of Mexico, and their substantial flavor comes through even after they have been breaded, fried, doused with marinara and blanketed with browned fresh mozzarella.\n        \n\n         That flavor comes through just as clearly in the shrimp fra diavolo, with a heap of pasta under spicy tomato sauce and, just so you don\u2019t forget where you are, a few clams. As a parade of marine life, though, the dish has nothing on the lobster fra diavolo, which supplements clams and shrimp with mussels and an entire Canadian lobster, ideally tender and sweet the night I had it.\n        \n\n         A different lobster dish on another night was problematic. The stuffing was an unexciting blend of baby shrimp, bread crumbs and, supposedly, crab meat. The claws were overdone to a rubbery dryness, but the tail, cooked more gently, had its quality intact.\n        \n\n         Randazzo\u2019s pasta with clams is a lesson in the meaning of generous portions: about a quarter-acre of linguine or spaghetti weighed down who knows how many chopped clams, very sweet and very fresh, and untold cloves of sliced garlic. The pasta is exactly the kind that Italian restaurants in this country served 40 years ago, before the phrase \u201cal dente\u201d got its green card. It is boiled in water with little if any salt, which is less of a drawback when the sauce piled on top is a hearty one like fra diavolo rather than a thin one like the marechiara.\n        \n\n         Very simple seafood dishes found at shacks up and down the East Coast can be quite good at Randazzo\u2019s: the raw Long Island oysters, littlenecks and cherrystones shucked at the counter; the steamers, free of grit once they are rinsed in their broth and dunked in drawn butter; the fat crab cakes wrapped in a spicy bread-crumb coating but otherwise light on the filler; the Manhattan chowder and, even though it is slightly thickened with cornstarch, the New England, both weighty with potatoes and clams.\n        \n\n         Less enticing are the lobster bisque and the corn-and-crab chowder, neither of which tastes much like its namesake shellfish. And given how pure most of the seafood is, I wish the fried clams were the squishy whole-belly variety, not chewy frozen strips in a sarcophagus of breading.\n        \n\n         This is one food that is beyond the help of the Sauce. Another is the slice of bread, slightly less hard than granite, that waits on each platter of calamari to traumatize the loose molars of neophytes. Simultaneously soggy and dry, hot and cold, it is too bizarre and unfathomable to be called awful; it is simply one of the world\u2019s mysteries, to be discussed while eating all the squid around it.\n        \n\n         Helen Randazzo was, according to her grandson, a virtual pescetarian. Still, her recipe for cut-up chicken marinated in lemon, olive oil, garlic and oregano, then roasted and charred under the broiler, is very good. Perhaps out of her distaste for land animals, she gave the dish the unalluring name \u201cburnt chicken.\u201d\n        \n\n         Paul Randazzo, who owns the place now, eats fish nearly every day, but he gave it up for the two months that his restaurant was closed after the hurricane. It was a form of protest, I imagine. The night of the storm, he was inside Randazzo\u2019s, standing on chairs and then on the counter when the bay refused to stay outside the doors. When he wanted company, he said, he got on a raft and paddled down what, just that afternoon, had been Emmons Avenue to visit a friend who was holed up on the second floor of Loehmann\u2019s.\n        \n\n         Did anything in the restaurant survive the flood?\n        \n\n         \u201cMe.\u201d\n        \n\n         Today the pink-granite floor tiles, the mirrored wall painted with a scene of the marina, the tables, the chairs and the restrooms are new. The faces are not. Mr. Randazzo, his wife and his four children still tend to customers, who come in all shapes, sizes, colors and ages. Randazzo\u2019s prices are not intimidating, especially for fresh seafood, and the welcome at the door is heartfelt.\n        \n\n         Had I grown up eating at Randazzo\u2019s, the emotion I felt tasting the Sauce might be love. But as a relative newcomer, I\u2019ll have to settle for gratitude.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 141, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-randazzos-clam-bar-in-sheepshead-bay.html", "google_mag": 26.0}, {"review_text": "\n         WHEN I HEARD that a\n         \n          new restaurant\n         \n         on West 26th Street had named itself after Maysville, the Kentucky town where Rosemary Clooney was born, I wondered why nobody had thought of this before. The singer had hopscotched her way across lyrics laden with enough\n         \n          food references\n         \n         to inspire a full menu.\n        \n\n         I worked up a real appetite imagining all those figs and dates and grapes and cakes, not to mention the apple, plum and apricot-a, too. An enchilada with a fish baccala always sounded like a strange but thrilling combination; this would be my chance to find out. And if that was a disappointment, I could rebound with mangoes, papayas \u2014 anything my heart desires.\n        \n\n         You can imagine my chagrin when I learned that Maysville\u2019s owners had in fact named the restaurant after the town\u2019s secondary claim to fame: it is also the birthplace of Kentucky bourbon.\n        \n\n         Disappointment began to thaw when I saw the soaring amber wall of whiskey bottles behind Maysville\u2019s bar. By the time I had a brooding, barrel-aged Sazerac in my hand, it was shrinking faster than the chips of ice on the cocktail\u2019s surface. And it melted away as I came to know the cooking of Maysville\u2019s chef, Kyle Knall, whose understated American style is a winning blend of the refined and the unpretentious.\n        \n\n         Encountered as words on the menu, some of his food may have a been-there, done-that feeling. But if you have done this before, it feels different this time.\n        \n\n         I have seen poached eggs over grits all around town, but I\u2019ve rarely tasted a version as compelling as Maysville\u2019s. The grits are creamier and the egg is softer, just barely set, so it dissolves on your tongue like warm jelly. Then Mr. Knall, who most recently cooked at\n         \n          Gramercy Tavern\n         \n         , takes it deeper, adding sensationally tender duck confit, saut\u00e9ed trumpet mushrooms and a few rich spoonfuls of smoked duck broth. It\u2019s the kind of bowl you\u2019d like to share. At the same time, you want to keep it to yourself.\n        \n\n         Smoked whitefish spread will never sound unusual as long as New Yorkers still eat bagels, but order it at Maysville. You\u2019ll be given an exceptionally smooth p\u00e2t\u00e9 packed into a jar under shimmering orange pearls of trout roe. You smear it on toast and wait for the little bursts of brine that come with each bite.\n        \n\n         I\u2019ve had more hay set in front of me in the past year than a thoroughbred training for the Kentucky Derby, but never was it used to as good effect as it is at Maysville, where its smoke infuses warm oysters. They cook on burning hay until they are on the cusp between raw and cooked, and then are carried to the table on a blanket of hay that is still smoldering.\n        \n\n         The common theme here is smoke, which curls throughout the menu. It adds unexpected depth to the mashed potatoes with an excellent sliced rib-eye cap. It\u2019s there in the papery sheets of country ham on top of crisp cubes of fried grits. It lends enough flavor to a whole smoked trout that Mr. Knall gets away with his decision to serve the fish with no sauce, just grilled onions, pickled mushrooms and tufts of watercress.\n        \n\n         The charred barrels in which Kentucky distillers age fresh corn liquor are the obvious reference point. And it\u2019s true that the smoke makes Maysville\u2019s food a more-than-willing companion to one of its 170 or so American whiskeys, or to a solidly constructed bourbon cocktail.\n        \n\n         But Mr. Knall has no intention of being the chef at a theme restaurant. His cooking is too smart for that. True, some things I ate erred on the side of subtlety: a few scant shavings of foie gras couldn\u2019t rouse a duck breast out of its slumber, and the biggest thrill in a braised pork shoulder was in counting the kinds of beans on the plate. (I lost track after the pigeon peas.)\n        \n\n         More often, he nailed the nuances. Roasted char over braised cabbage with some frilly fried potato skins rebooted familiar cold-weather flavors. And with a marvelous crisp chicken leg, he brought urbane finesse to fried chicken without sucking all the pleasure out of it.\n        \n\n         Mr. Knall and Sean Josephs, the owner of Maysville and of\n         \n          Char No. 4\n         \n         in Brooklyn, have built a restaurant that feels thoroughly American. The cheese plate showcases domestic products, as does the wine list, which is surprisingly extensive even if its large number of three-digit prices feels out of place.\n        \n\n         In Maysville\u2019s confident restatement of the American tavern, you might see the influence of Mr. Knall\u2019s last job. As at Gramercy Tavern, a long, often-packed bar supplies the pulse of the front dining room. That pulse can be boomingly loud when a largely male crowd straight from the office is clamoring for brown liquor. A smaller back dining room, which has a Siberian cast at first glance, is the more obliging space if your dinner plans include conversation.\n        \n\n         The service in both rooms is comfortable and, yes, American, with staff \u2014 men and women \u2014 outfitted in plaid shirts and blue jeans, as if trying out for a remake of \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard.\u201d\n        \n\n         This is mildly hokey but also a great relief after a decade in which New York restaurants started calling themselves gastropubs and taking cues from London (London!), as if no bar in the United States had served good food before the Spotted Pig.\n        \n\n         The gooey British imprint of sticky toffee pudding is nowhere to be found on Maysville\u2019s dessert menu. Instead there is old reliable bread pudding, not as drenched in custard as it would be in New Orleans, but making up for that with quantities of nutty brown butter.\n        \n\n         Other desserts can be a little less focused than the savory courses. A pumpkin cheesecake tasted more of Thanksgiving pie spices than it did of squash, and while pickled raisins and baby carrots poached in syrup promised good things for a carrot cake, the cake itself was slightly dry.\n        \n\n         But the champion sweet is apple granita heaped over raw apples, poached quince and some tangy white yogurt. \u201cWhat is that herb?\u201d everyone at the table wondered, dipping spoons for the third time into the powdery, pale-green apple snow flecked with bits of a darker green. It\u2019s tarragon, providing just the kind of deft touch that by then I\u2019d come to expect from Maysville.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 143, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-maysville-in-manhattan.html", "google_mag": 24.5}, {"review_text": "\n         AS soon as you settle on your order at\n         \n          Arlington Club\n         \n         , which can take time because the menu sprawls out like a reclining lawn chair, a basket will land on your table. The basket will hold popovers. The popovers will be huge, steaming hot inside and bronze on top, with a crown of baked Gruy\u00e8re, Emmental and fontina.\n        \n\n         One more thing they will be is gone within minutes. They are that good, as you will remember if you have ever eaten at\n         \n          BLT Steak\n         \n         , where a very similar popover kicks off your meal. For anyone who hasn\u2019t tasted one recently, it\u2019s great to see them again at Arlington Club, now two months into its run on the Upper East Side.\n        \n\n         And it\u2019s great to see the restaurant\u2019s chef, Laurent Tourondel, again. The founder of BLT Steak and other places embroidered with the same monogram, Mr. Tourondel has not opened a full-scale restaurant in New York City in more than five years.\n        \n\n         Born and trained in France, he has an almost diabolical knack for sophisticated crowd pleasers like that popover. When he\u2019s in the zone, as he is most of the time at Arlington Club, his cooking is as ingratiating as it is skillful; it wins your affection right away and then your respect.\n        \n\n         I thought I never needed to taste another chef\u2019s take on macaroni and cheese until I tried the one at Arlington Club, and was struck by the way Mr. Tourondel had contrived to give each noodle a golden tip of crust, and had bound them all together in a powerfully smoky Gouda sauce.\n        \n\n         When I saw a side dish of truffled gnocchi on the menu, I didn\u2019t expect it to do much more than pad the check. But the little dumplings in cream and melted Parmesan were so delicate that they immediately collapsed on the tongue into yielding parcels of mashed potato.\n        \n\n         These dishes and others are the kind of things that make you start plotting your next meal at Arlington Club as you\u2019re calculating the tip.\n        \n\n         What they are not, oddly enough, are the kind of things you expect to see at a steakhouse. And a steakhouse is what Arlington Club hopes to be taken for. At times, this desire seems like an acute case of identity crisis.\n        \n\n         Certainly, there is nothing at\n         \n          Sparks\n         \n         or\n         \n          Keens\n         \n         that recalls the soaring chicken-wire-and-glass prow over the bar that juts out like a steampunk version of one of Hector Guimard\u2019s Paris Metro entrances. A train station motif continues with the enormous clock by the stairs to the upper dining room, and in the twin barrel vaults on the ceiling that amplify the pounding noise. (Softer acoustics are coming soon, Mr. Tourondel said.) The light fixtures were made in Brooklyn, a server told me; so is the seltzer the waiters are always pushing and the half-sour pickles that come with the popovers.\n        \n\n         While this suggests a desperate chasing after another borough\u2019s trends, at least the prime beef is classic steakhouse meat, ranched in the Midwest, gorged on corn in its final weeks and dry-aged almost a month. The steaks are seared on a 1,200-degree broiler, rested, then seared again, with effects that varied from night to night. Once, the c\u00f4te de boeuf for two and the rich and concentrated bone-in rib-eye had magnificent crusts. Other times, the sirloin, filet mignon on the bone and the porterhouse lacked that intense char, but in compensation the interiors were more evenly rosy and juicy.\n        \n\n         The steakhouse\u2019s usual supporting players are there, too. The servers wear white cotton, enough of it to rig a schooner. There is a Caesar salad in a dressing sharp with anchovies and garlic. Some other chefs in town should come by to see how it\u2019s done.\n        \n\n         Potatoes are handled expertly, in the fries that few mortals will be able to stop eating and in the potatoes Arlington, which are sliced and cooked in clarified butter until it infuses their white centers and browns their edges to a shattering crisp. The customary shrimp cocktail, while not quite at the pinnacle of the form, is better than many. Trying to improve creamed spinach, the kitchen overreaches with an unpleasant dose of nutmeg.\n        \n\n         Yet the menu strays far from the steakhouse roster, too.\n        \n\n         Do not, I beg you, get involved with the sushi rolls. The rice is cold and tightly packed; the fish is dull. The sushi menu is so out of place that it\u2019s a little embarrassing, in the way of a Hawaiian shirt bought on vacation and worn to the office.\n        \n\n         Instead, you might try an excellent, if highly un-\n         \n          Palm\n         \n         -ish, red snapper fillet in an electrifying pool of black vinegar, with ginger and chiles for added emphasis. Or, in a less forceful Asian mode, the black bass steamed in a tranquilly aromatic broth of coconut and lime.\n        \n\n         Whatever the theme, the neighborhood is clearly buying it. There are boys-night-out tables, girls-night-out tables, tables of families with preteen boys in camel-hair blazers that allow room to grow, and, one evening, a man with a skull printed on his shirt who was cheerfully dragging on an electronic cigarette.\n        \n\n         They all look delighted to be right where they are, except maybe the preteen boys and the people by the bar who are being made to wait a very long time for a table. If you happen to look over at the velvet rope that keeps the unseated out of the dining room, you may see their resentful eyes willing you to skip dessert.\n        \n\n         Turn your back and order a cr\u00eape souffl\u00e9, a puffy sweet omelet dusted with powdered sugar and served with warm berries. The size of a deflated football, it is a dessert for hard-working French country people of another century. Miraculously, it waits on Lexington Avenue today for modern in-box cobblers and tweetsmiths.\n        \n\n         It has no business in a steakhouse, of course. But like many such things at Arlington Club, it\u2019s memorably good. The restaurant doesn\u2019t know how to follow the script, but its improvisations are inspired.\n        \n\n         The identity crisis may really belong to the steakhouse itself, which increasingly seems like a self-conscious relic, the way Westerns did in the 1970s. How many diners today really want to eat a pound of red meat at one sitting? And with what we know today about its effects on the environment and on health (ours and that of the animals), the words cornfed beef do not stir the appetite the way they used to.\n        \n\n         It\u2019s become harder to believe the myth of the steakhouse. Arlington Club presents the old religion, but it has plenty of other gods on offer for the nonbelievers. The restaurant may not know what to call itself, but it knows what it\u2019s doing.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 144, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-arlington-club-on-the-upper-east-side.html", "google_mag": 27.600000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n\n          PIZZA IS NOT A HUMBLE\n         \n         food, and great pizza is not usually made by humble people.

In an otherwise unremarkable restaurant, spotting this outcropping of glam is like boarding the morning commuter train from Mount Kisco and discovering that you are sitting next to RuPaul.\n        \n\n         The menu seems to revert to the ordinary. There are pizza knots, rice balls and meatballs, a few salads and a handful of simple pastas including spaghetti with tomato sauce. Then there are the pies, including three under the heading Pizza Napoletana. This might have stood out a decade ago. Today, it puts Krescendo among a herd of brick-oven strivers.\n        \n\n         But here, under Pizza Italiana Classica, is a flash of lam\u00e9: Finocchio Flower Power.\n        \n\n         What is on top of the crust is mainly fennel, but to call it a topping would imply that it is interchangeable with some other item. It is not. This pizza is an essay on the theme of fennel. Ms. Falkner stews the bulb to draw out its mellow sweetness, spreads out some raw fronds for their fresh, herbal flavor and calls on the seeds in fennel sausage for their licorice snap. The vegetable\u2019s candylike tendencies are kept in check by sharp aged provolone and powdered red chiles from Calabria.\n        \n\n         The Finocchio Flower Power is the pizza version of the sparkly oven, a lavishly constructed detail that lets you know that Krescendo is much better than the neighborhood Italian joint it is trying to pass for. I do not know why Ms. Falkner and Nancy Puglisi, the restaurant\u2019s owner, camouflaged the place so thoroughly, but the result is that not enough people are talking about Krescendo.\n        \n\n         Ms. Falkner is skillful enough to make something exceptional out of the utterly simple: Krescendo\u2019s marinara pizza, with four or five golden cloves of roasted garlic on a plush red circle of oregano-scented tomato sauce.\n        \n\n         At the other end of the scale, she can assemble a complex fleet of ingredients that seem to be headed for a nasty collision and send them whizzing around the racetrack. One pizza, the Californication, is topped with prosciutto, shishito peppers, arugula, honey, two kinds of cheese and an arugula-walnut pesto. It sounds preposterous, but it\u2019s very good, if you can bring yourself to ask for it by name.\n        \n\n         One pizza didn\u2019t work at all, the Clam Pie, which had few of the shellfish and little of their flavor. But the one called the Cure, with sopressata and fresh Fresno chiles, tasted potent enough to fix colds, hangovers and the January shivers, both the physical and metaphysical varieties.\n        \n\n\n          INTENDED AS A KIND\n         \n         of edible plate for Ms. Falkner\u2019s cooking, Krescendo\u2019s pizza crust is not bland, though it is scant on salt and lacks deep flavor. But it is exceptionally light and tender, with what pizza researchers call good \u201ccrumb structure.\u201d The rim is evenly browned, with no black blisters and only a few dark speckles. The char is minimal, but you can often taste the smoke that pours across the roof of the oven from the wood fire banked on one side.\n        \n\n         On four different nights, the crust looked and tasted virtually the same, a consistency that eludes some of New York\u2019s most acclaimed pizzerias.\n        \n\n         Very few of those places attempt a gluten-free crust, something that Krescendo has already mastered. Made with rice flour, potato starch and cornstarch, it is the Bizarro World double of the wheat-flour crust: crackling rather than soft, flat rather than puffy, with a fuller, more savory taste. It is not my first choice, but it is a good choice.\n        \n\n         The quality of a restaurant\u2019s pizza often correlates negatively with that of its pastas and salads. Ms. Falkner brings the same quiet focus to all her cooking at Krescendo. Her pasta con le sarde, with toasted pebbles of Sardinian fregola, is exceptional. And while the spaghetti al pomodoro does not surpass the great version at\n         \n          Scarpetta\n         \n         , it comes close enough to survive the comparison unscathed, and it contains way less butter.\n        \n\n         Krescendo\u2019s pizza knots are more like zeppole, deep-fried dough with a tendency to be a bit undercooked at the core. But get them anyway and avoid the doughy parts, dipping the rest in the remarkably deep sauce of black garlic, calamata olives, balsamic vinegar and molasses. The finest use of the kitchen\u2019s fryer is the terrific cod fritter, served with just-tender cannellini.\n        \n\n         When Ms. Falkner deviates from Italy, she shows \u00a0a Californian\u2019s intuition for produce, as in a lovely fritto misto of sliced pears, acorn squash and onions. A beet salad one night was just routine, but finely honed instincts were at work in a salad of raw and fried kale in a lemony dressing, with pancetta candy hidden under the leaves like a prize.\n        \n\n         As a young art-school graduate in San Francisco, Ms. Falkner first saw the sculptural possibilities of sugar and batter. Soon she was off, making desserts that teetered and towered like the designs of a chocolate-mad architect.\n        \n\n         You will have guessed by now that Krescendo offers almost no hint of her pathbreaking work at Citizen Cake and Orson in San Francisco. But order the cassata. In Palermo, Sicily, cassata is a spongecake adorned with marzipan, ricotta and candied fruit. Ms. Falkner essentially blows it up, sending the pieces all over the plate and taking advantage of the chaos to make each fragment a little more exciting. The cake is pistachio; the cherries are soaked in Campari; out of nowhere there is a scoop of excellent tangerine sorbet.\n        \n\n         The dessert is another of Ms. Falkner\u2019s tiled ovens. I suspect it will not be her last.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 145, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-krescendo-in-boerum-hill-brooklyn.html", "google_mag": 26.899999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n         Back in the 1960s, when nobody except rats, longshoremen and gangsters needing to dispose of a wayward bookie saw much value in the\n         \n\n\n          Brooklyn\n         \n         waterfront, Michael O\u2019Keeffe saw romance. He saw enough flowers for a year of proms, he saw a piano player massaging a Steinway, he saw a curtain of glass framing the Brooklyn Bridge and the lights of Fortress\n         \n\n\n          Manhattan\n         \n         on the other side. All of this he saw floating on a barge in the East River. After pleading for permits for 12 years, he persuaded City Hall to see it, too, and in 1977 the River Caf\u00e9 dropped anchors.\n        \n\n         Did Mr. O\u2019Keeffe see men producing diamond rings from their jacket pockets? He has seen it hundreds of times since. So have I, sitting at the bar one summer a few years back when a young man talked his date into catching the view from the deck outside then dropped to one knee, right next to the swiveling mounted binoculars. I\u2019ll never forget it, or the look in the couple\u2019s dewy eyes when they discovered that the door to the dining room had locked behind them.\n        \n\n         No questions were popped at the River Caf\u00e9 for more than a year after\n         \n\n\n          Hurricane Sandy\n         \n         dished out a surge tide that even a barge couldn\u2019t stay on top of. When the River Caf\u00e9 opened again in February, the walls, ships\u2019 deck floorboards, the grand piano, most of the wine cellar and nearly everything else was new. You\u2019d never know it. Mr. O\u2019Keeffe paid for a museum-quality restoration.\n        \n\n         As before, you reach the River Caf\u00e9 by traveling down a cobbled driveway with lanterns and a miniature forest of plants on either side, as if Snow White\u2019s cottage were at the end of the road. The entrance casts its fairy-tale spell on a good number of wanderers who follow the winding road only to be sent away because they don\u2019t have jackets (for the men) or reservations (for everyone). Those who are allowed inside cross a short gangplank to the floating dining room, where captains in black tuxedos stand guard. On the right, flowers; on the left, a pianist who gently spoons out ballads for hours on end without ever seeming to need a break. He doesn\u2019t sing, but memory dredges up the words: When I\u2019m close to you, dear, the stars fill the sky. So in love with you am I.\n        \n\n         This trickling brook of melodies babbling away in the background is more pretty than beautiful. Like many things about the River Caf\u00e9, it is white-limo elegant. But so few New York restaurants today reach for elegance of any kind that the resurgence of this one is a gift to the city.\n        \n\n         Even harder to find are restaurants where tourists can go to gape at the view and New Yorkers can go without being embarrassed. Windows on the World, once straight across the river, is gone for good, and the return of the revolving dance floor at the Rainbow Room, scheduled for October, can\u2019t come soon enough. No place in the city combines spectacle with hideaway intimacy and undiluted romance the way the River Caf\u00e9 does.\n        \n\n         And if more customers will take photographs of the Brooklyn Bridge\u2019s steel underbelly than of their plates, the food is still much better than you might fear if you\u2019ve been to other restaurants with souvenir views. \u201cThe kitchen aims to please but not to shock,\u201d William Grimes wrote in his\n         \n          two-star review 12 years ago\n         \n         , the last time the restaurant was assessed in\n         \n\n\n          The New York Times\n         \n         . That hasn\u2019t changed. Neither has the chef, Brad Steelman, who has been in his post since 2000.\n        \n\n         The sailor\u2019s \u201csteady as she goes\u201d might be the River Caf\u00e9\u2019s motto. An opening salvo from the kitchen, a single shrimp on a Southeast Asian papaya salad with crushed peanuts, makes it clear that flavor epiphanies are not in store. The rack of lamb I ate recently, which was inside a skinny ring of mint jelly zipped up with mustard seeds, appeared to be the same dish Mr. Grimes described. (We both liked it.) Radiating like spokes from a hub of firm, hand-chopped steak tartare are lines of mustard, chopped capers, shallots, cornichons and chives: the usual suspects.\n        \n\n         Mr. Steelman doesn\u2019t need his garnishes to provide hologram moonwalks, though. His main ingredients are almost always good enough to be their own special effects. For his shrimp Oscar, he sets hollandaise boosted with blood-orange juice against beautifully sweet Pacific blue shrimp and meaty white lumps of crab. In another appetizer called Three Shells, strips of abalone dunked in a yuzu-kaffir bath and firm little kumamoto oysters in a classic mignonette had the shining immediacy of great seafood, too, even if the third shell, Taylor Bay scallops ceviche, didn\u2019t quite keep up.\n        \n\n         And while poached lobster could probably find more exciting companions than celery root pur\u00e9e and slightly sweet-sour butternut squash dice, the lobster itself was tender and sweet enough to be a solo act. A duck breast whose skin has a terrific crisp shellac, seasoned with lavender and a trace of dried chiles, was better served by the cozy Eastern European comfort of glossy braised red cabbage and crisp squiggles of sweet-potato spaetzle.\n        \n\n         Some of Mr. Steelman\u2019s ideas can be questioned. His extremely good Barolo-braised oxtail appetizer would get along nicely with either polenta or pasta, but perhaps not with polenta stuffed inside pasta. And he piled too much breading on fried oysters, which were rescued from dryness only by their topping of smoked salmon and caviar. In general, though, he sticks to classic notions and we get the rewards; his mushroom Wellington turns the obligatory vegetarian main course into a real event.\n        \n\n         Desserts, included in the three-course $115 fixed-price dinner, could use refreshing. Vanilla ice cream and vanilla ice milk turn up on several, with no noticeable taste of vanilla. But that didn\u2019t hurt the milk-chocolate souffl\u00e9, already sweetened by a melting cap of toasted marshmallow, or the chocolate marquise straddled by a dark chocolate replica of the Brooklyn Bridge\u2019s towers and cables.\n        \n\n         Maybe a chocolate bridge is a little hokey, but so is dropping to one knee in front of the Manhattan skyline. In both cases what counts is not the originality of the gesture but its sincerity. In its desire to sweep us into its secluded, flower-strewn island, the River Caf\u00e9 is sincere in a way that restaurants hardly ever are these days. At the end of a night there, I always regret that it\u2019s time to come back to the mainland.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 146, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/21/dining/restaurant-review-the-river-cafe-at-fulton-ferry.html", "google_mag": 23.700000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n         Gather around the old Victrola, kids. Grandpa wants to tell you a story about wealth, power, real estate, pornography, carrots and a sweet-faced dairy cow named Narcissa.\n        \n\n         About 90 miles north of\n         \n\n\n          Manhattan\n         \n         is a 76-acre\n         \n          triangle of land\n         \n         on the Hudson River whose owners over the centuries have acted out the history, in stop-frame animation, of social power in New York. When Dutch families ran half of the\n         \n\n\n          Hudson Valley\n         \n         , it was farmed by the son of a settler from the\n         \n\n\n          Netherlands\n         \n         . He sold the place to one of the Livingstons, an aristocratic Scottish family who ran the other half.\n        \n\n         As Gilded Age capitalists crashed New York society, the property was bought by William B. Dinsmore, a founder of a company that was the\n         \n          U.P.S. of the Civil War era\n         \n         , but with stagecoaches instead of brown vans. The Dinsmores had a Gatsbyesque time there, entertaining trainloads of weekend guests with a private golf course and\n         \n          a greenhouse full of orchids\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         Pipe down, I\u2019m getting to the porn.\n        \n\n         There are always fun new ways to get rich in America, and in the prolonged group grope between the invention of the Pill and the\n         \n          Meese Report\n         \n         ,\n         \n          Bob Guccione got rich\n         \n         by printing photos of Penthouse pets, who exposed things that the\n         \n\n\n          blushing\n         \n         Playmates didn\u2019t. With his earnings, Mr. Guccione bought the old Dinsmore estate. But when we chased pornography off our streets and onto our laptops, Mr. Guccione wasn\u2019t rich any more, and his country retreat was seized by creditors.\n        \n\n         Now we save our soft-focus pictures for pork chops, and restaurants are one of the last places where moaning in public is still acceptable. So of course the person who bought the property at auction is\n         \n          a restaurateur, Andr\u00e9 Balazs\n         \n         . Renaming the estate Locusts-on-Hudson, Mr. Balazs rents it out for weddings (\n         \n          the website\n         \n         tastefully passes over the gold-chained Guccione years) and farms the land again. Today it is home to vegetable plots, laying hens and a retired cow, Narcissa. She gave her name to Mr. Balazs\u2019s latest restaurant, inside his Standard East Village hotel, and her moony eyes look down at the dining room from framed photographs.\n        \n\n         Narcissa the cow has no role in the restaurant\u2019s rib-eye steak, but the farm is supposed to help in other ways. Last fall, Narcissa\u2019s chef, John Fraser, started planning this summer\u2019s menu by choosing the vegetables he wanted from illustrated seed catalogs. These books, he said, were \u201cfood porn in and of themselves.\u201d\n        \n\n         Whether teenage boys will hide pictures of undressed kohlrabi under their mattresses remains to be seen, but Mr. Fraser has already come up with one of the year\u2019s most photographed carrots. A take on beef Wellington, it has salt-cured roasted carrots inside the puff pastry where the meat should go. It\u2019s a startling success. The carrots are tender without a trace of mushiness, and a walnut paste darkened with cocoa and coffee gives them a brooding, bittersweet depth.\n        \n\n         Mr. Fraser is known for his refined, thought-out vegetable tasting menus at\n         \n          Dovetail\n         \n         , on the Upper West Side. His vegetable plates at Narcissa are more unbuttoned and generous. They\u2019re complex, but in a relaxed way that fits this casual, many-things-to-many-people dining room, where tables of chef chasers sit next to narrow-waisted colts who look as if they get their nutrients from air kisses.\n        \n\n         Beets are spit-roasted for hours until their outsides are charred like grilled steak and the insides have a focused, waterless intensity; then they\u2019re lightly crushed into deep-ruby hunks that drink up a horseradish cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. Plum-size sweet potatoes go on the rotisserie, too, getting a hot allspice-heavy jerk sauce completely right for their sugary flesh, which can taste flabby on its own.\n        \n\n         This kitchen knows how to build a salad, mixing vinaigrettes that have a switchblade edge and tossing in sophisticated-hippie handfuls of sunflower seeds (with saucerlike leaves of brussels sprouts) or crunchy chopped pistachios (in the mixed-greens Narcissa\u2019s salad).\n        \n\n         Side dishes are often a crass adventure in check-padding. That\u2019s not the case at Narcissa, although the carrot fries \u2014 overdone carrots in a greasy battered shell \u2014 just made me miss the Wellington. (This is why magicians never repeat a trick.) But I could eat Narcissa\u2019s steamed new potatoes in green garlic and olive oil all summer long, and I wish steakhouses would steal its \u201csupergreen spinach,\u201d wilted leaves folded into a b\u00e9chamel-fortified pur\u00e9e that has a Sprite-bottle gleam.\n        \n\n         I\u2019m giving these vegetables lingering close-ups because they have a swaggering originality that the meat and seafood rarely match. Hake with a south-of-\n         \n\n\n          France\n         \n         trio of tapenade, oranges and artichokes, and a poussin the size of a mango with legs, in a vaguely truffled chicken reduction, were extremely pleasant, but wouldn\u2019t get Narcissa noticed on their own.\n        \n\n         Other dishes seemed designed for jet-lagged hotel guests who don\u2019t want any back-talk from their dinner, like the not-quite-juicy roasted branzino with a standard-issue salsa verde. Mr. Fraser could use a few more main courses like the steamed black sea bass, which worked up some excitement \u2014 an uphill battle for steamed fish \u2014 by means of a toasty coconut-curry broth and hollow cross-sections of green almonds, squeaky-crisp as an unripe pear.\n        \n\n         Deborah Racicot\u2019s desserts are just clever enough; if you\u2019re paying attention, you can tell that she is, too. To go with a round chocolate tart, like a brownie with a melted center, she lightly curries bananas, using slightly green ones so they\u2019re not too cloying. The nicest thing I can say about the long winter is that it allowed her citrus salad with tapioca pudding and orange-blossom granit\u00e9 to stay on the menu until May.\n        \n\n         Tableside patter can be strange. A server one night talked up the \u201cday-trip scallops\u201d (lucky them) and pushed carrots Wellington as a mid-meal \u201cpalate cleanser.\u201d There was no song and dance from the wine staff, led by Ashley Santoro, only to-the-point advice on a very appealing list.\n        \n\n         The design has a disjointed feel. Wooden chairs hang from pegs, in the aspirational Shaker Zen style, but the low zigzag partition along the bar could come from a Vegas coffee shop. Then there\u2019s the steep staircase to the restrooms with crazy diagonal stripes reflected in the mirrored ceiling. It looks as if the director of\n         \n          \u201cThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\u201d\n         \n         had remade\n         \n\n\n          \u201cThe Lost Weekend.\u201d\n         \n         If you\u2019ve been drinking, tie a rope around your waist and have a friend slowly lower you down.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 147, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/28/dining/restaurant-review-narcissa-in-the-standard-east-village.html", "google_mag": 22.5}, {"review_text": "\n         Independent thinkers find this hard to admit, but when you see crowds of New Yorkers standing outside a bakery or putting their names on the list at the door of a restaurant, more often than not the food they\u2019re hanging around for is worth eating.\n        \n\n         Whether it\u2019s worth the wait is a separate question. In general, though, the crowds know something. Dominique Ansel Bakery is a wonderland, and Maison Premiere\u2019s happy hour is such an amazing bargain that I am afraid that simply mentioning it may spook the owners into charging more than a dollar for each pristine oyster.\n        \n\n         There are exceptions to this rule. It does not apply to lines formed by tourists who trade their vacation days for a handful of cake crumbs under a waxy helmet of frosting on Bleecker Street. Nor does it apply to lines for brunch. Be wary of the opinions of people who will endure hunger and hangovers for a free mimosa.\n        \n\n         And so far, the rule does not apply to the lines at\n         \n\n\n          Han Dynasty\n         \n         in the East Village, a Sichuan restaurant that has been quoting waiting times at dinner of 45 minutes or more since it opened around Labor Day. This is nothing new for its owner, Han Chiang. Lines have been a feature of the six Han Dynasties he operates in and around\n         \n\n\n          Philadelphia\n         \n         . Despite his habit of informing customers, in loud and profane terms, that certain items on the menu should not be ordered by anyone but children, Han Dynasty has been so popular that he\n         \n          plans to open 100 locations\n         \n         around the country.\n        \n\n         I can think of quite a few towns where this would be great news, but I\u2019m mystified by the popularity of Han Dynasty in\n         \n\n\n          Manhattan\n         \n         , where there are far better Sichuan restaurants. Han Dynasty\u2019s translation of the cuisine has a thick American accent. Many main courses are heavy on sugar, bell peppers and especially MSG, which is often used in great, slashing doses. They come across as close relatives of the kung pao chicken made by the best Chinese takeout in your neighborhood. In fact, your local joint might do this Sichuan crossover hit better than Han Dynasty, whose version was one of the sweetest and least appealing things on the menu.\n        \n\n         In the restaurant\u2019s anemic interpretation of cumin lamb, floppy bands of meat, drenched in a syrupy sauce, were too wet to give off any of the amazing fragrance of toasted spices that announce the dish\u2019s arrival before it reaches the table at Szechuan Gourmet in Midtown, Little Pepper in College Point,\n         \n\n\n          Queens\n         \n         , or a dozen other restaurants around town.\n        \n\n         Under the menu heading \u201cShifu Special\u201d (shifu means, roughly, chef) is the classic Taiwanese dish Three Cup Chicken. By tradition, the sauce is made with a cup each of rice wine, soy and sesame oil. Han Dynasty seemed to add a cup of sugar, too, and applied so much sauce that the chicken, meant to be served sizzling, arrived in a caramel soup.\n        \n\n         Apart from the dan dan noodles, which needed more snap from black vinegar, the appetizers were a less cloying crew, their seasoning closer to the Sichuan spirit. Cold rabbit with peanuts in chile oil, with the thrilling, classic combination of red chiles and Sichuan peppercorns, made my lips vibrate like a tuning fork. Dry pepper chicken wings had all the crunch, complexity and aromatic power I\u2019d missed in the cumin lamb.\n        \n\n         I had hoped that somebody would curse at me when I ordered. It never happened. Actually, the service was unusually friendly and forthcoming with the kinds of detail about the dishes that can be hard to obtain in some Sichuan restaurants. And the egg-yolk-colored paint and modern, Chinese-themed art on the walls give the place some energy. Still, if I want Han Dynasty\u2019s wings again, I\u2019ll get delivery. A 45-minute wait for the doorbell to ring would be well within reason.\n        \n\n         There are no lines at Hirohisa, which opened last summer on a quiet SoHo block. Instead there are reservations, which lately have not been hard to come by. In some ways, it\u2019s easy to see why the crowds have passed it by. The cooking is very Japanese, in the let-the-ingredients-speak mode that can leave some Americans cold.\n        \n\n         \u201cIt\u2019s ... subtle,\u201d one person at my table said.\n        \n\n         \u201cVery subtle,\u201d another said.\n        \n\n         At times, I agreed. Some of the grilled meat courses, for instance, didn\u2019t leave an impression on my memory as large as the one they left on the bill.\n        \n\n         But for the most part, I love the way Hirohisa Hayashi, the chef, brings out the whispering harmonies that result when one small wave of flavor laps against another.\n        \n\n         He finds those harmonies in the way lightly charred blocks of sesame tofu come together with buttery lobes of sea urchin and shreds of fresh wasabi. And again in the bowl of raw salmon layered over white rice, which becomes a steaming soup as you add roasted green tea from a pot.\u00a0And again in the gently sweet and seductive stew of lobster in white miso and dashi.\n        \n\n         But nuanced flavors can also be potent, as an omakase meal last fall made clear. Mr. Hayashi intensified grilled lamb by marinating it in red miso. Served on top of a hunk of grilled tilefish was a slab of broiled foie gras; the heat chased the fat from the liver, and this became the sauce for the fish. It was a dish to make you shake your head twice, once for how luxurious it felt, and again for how simple it was.\n        \n\n         Hirohisa is a kappo-style restaurant, a form of Japanese dining in which the chef makes both hot and cold dishes behind a counter. There are two kitchen islands floating at the edge of the serene white dining room, one for cold dishes like sashimi and another where the cooking takes place. You watch the action and relax, drink in hand, as if a friend had invited you over for dinner. In this case, you\u2019re drinking sake from a list of junmai (\u201csubtle rice and water\u201d), junmai ginjo (\u201cunrestrained challenge\u201d) and junmai dai ginjo (\u201ca specific target\u201d).\n        \n\n         With a carafe on the table, the soft light flowing from alcoves in the ceiling, the chefs bending over their knives, all the lines around the city seem very far away.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 148, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/dining/restaurant-review-han-dynasty-in-the-east-village-and-hirohisa-in-soho.html", "google_mag": 23.5}, {"review_text": "\n         Gato galloped into town in March, pursued by the food media and\n         \n\n\n          Bobby Flay\n         \n         fans in a thundering cloud of hoofbeats. The first new restaurant Mr. Flay and his business partner, Laurence Kretchmer, have opened in\n         \n\n\n          New York City\n         \n         in nearly a decade,\n         \n          Gato\n         \n         is nominally Mediterranean, but the chef rides herd on pastas and pizzas and romesco sauces with a go-for-broke intensity that\u2019s 100 percent American. Mr. Flay brushes flavor on his ingredients in thick impasto strokes, making each plate a three-dimensional aggregation of char, smoke, capsicum, sugar, acid and fat. The cooking at Gato is many things, often all at the same time, but it is rarely shy.\n        \n\n         \u201cTons of olive oil,\u201d Mr. Flay promised in\n         \n          a January interview in The New York Times\n         \n         as the space in NoHo was under plywood. \u201cTons of salty flavors like anchovies and olives and capers. Lots of citrus. Tons of things like tomatoes and peppers, both hot and sweet.\u201d Stand aside, all you chefs fiddling with tweezers and eyedroppers; Bobby Flay is backing up an 18-wheeler loaded with anchovies.\n        \n\n         Of the first generation of gunslinging Food Network chefs, Mr. Flay is the only one who stayed in the saddle as the channel\u2019s mission shifted from dump-and-stir cooking lessons to ticking-clock gladiator contests. He also kept his dignity; he acts like a professional, not a cartoon. Still, playing a chef isn\u2019t the same as being one, and as the real estate market picked off first Bolo and then\n         \n          Mesa Grill\n         \n         , his New York presence was whittled down to just\n         \n          Bar Americain\n         \n         , a Whitman\u2019s Sampler of American regional favorites.\n        \n\n         To audiences who don\u2019t remember how skillfully he conjured up bursts of sunlight in Mesa Grill\u2019s prime, Mr. Flay was in danger of becoming another Old West sharpshooter who\u2019d joined up with\n         \n\n\n          Buffalo Bill\n         \n         Cody to delight big-top crowds by blasting holes in playing cards. With Gato, he\u2019s a grizzled sheriff pinning on his badge again and returning to the precincts where he first laid down the law. He\u2019s out to prove he\u2019s more than just a big hat.\n        \n\n         But the frontier is a-changin\u2019. The townspeople expect all kinds of newfangled foolishness. If they aren\u2019t amazed by every bite, they\u2019ll yelp like coyotes. Worse, they can\u2019t live without small plates. Fine, Bobby Flay can do small plates. He can crush small plates with one hand. His bar snacks, three porcelain bowls lined up on a slate for $17, are compact flavor bombs that detonate quickly and leave a vivid afterimage.\n        \n\n         He\u2019ll stuff cubes of tuna tartare inside a piquillo pepper, pitting cool and raw against roasted and mildly spicy. He makes a tiny powerhouse of fresh chorizo wrapped in caul fat, and gives it some shaved pickled fennel to calm its hotheaded tendencies. Many chefs leave burrata to its own, oozy devices; Mr. Flay piles on roasted beets and a vinaigrette made from oil in which black olives have stewed, and suddenly it\u2019s a dish with something to say.\n        \n\n         I\u2019m omitting some other stuff on these plates both for brevity and because they never swamped the rest. The size of the bar snacks may limit how much flavor-troweling Mr. Flay can do. Some of the bigger plates show his maximalist embroidery at its bring-it-on best; others seem to leave too much space for his\n         \n          BeDazzler\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         Rabbits have a famous love for carrots, but I\u2019ve never seen one take to the vegetable the way Gato\u2019s juicy braised rabbit leg takes to its carrot hot sauce, which tastes like sweet fire. Nor have I tasted a tarragon chicken in which the minty-licorice character of the herb had the flute-note brightness it has at Gato, which carpets the bird\u2019s crisp skin with a variety of salsa verde made from chopped raw tarragon.\n        \n\n         Mr. Flay can put a crust on a paella like nobody\u2019s business, and the crunchy grains of rice, once you unstick them from the bottom of the pan and mix them with a steamed egg, fried artichokes and big, tender leaves of saut\u00e9ed kale, have a flavor-texture dynamic that\u2019s just fun to eat. Steamed halibut promises all the thrills of curling up in bed with a bond fund\u2019s quarterly report. Mr. Flay plunks the fish into a bowl of saffron-tomato soup made from halibut stock and bulked up with couscous, and if it\u2019s not quite thrilling, it still has a winning depth of flavor, and some nuance, too.\n        \n\n         Nuance has never been Mr. Flay\u2019s middle name, but he can achieve it, particularly in the main courses. With some of the more hyperactive dishes at Gato, though, it\u2019s as if his years of competitive cooking have trained him to go for the knockout punch right away. He\u2019ll funnel every ounce of flavor into the first bite, and he seems to be afraid that if he leaves out some trick, the judges will have enough taste buds left to notice what his rivals are up to.\n        \n\n         Fettuccine was soaked with potent, briny squid ink and mussel broth until it elbowed everything else \u2014 red prawns, mussels and a quiet green-onion pur\u00e9e \u2014 right off the plate. A side of piment\u00f3n-dusted potatoes fried to shattering bits, like crumbled bacon, was oily enough on its own without the extra richness of a runny poached egg and salty enough without a frosting of Parmigiano-Reggiano.\n        \n\n         Cheese is wheeled out again and again: soft shreds of fontina in a chicory salad; crumbs of pecorino over asparagus and fava beans whose spring freshness would have been better off with just the yellow romesco; goat cheese with crunchy potatoes alongside that tarragon chicken; gobs of bucheron in a plate of scrambled eggs blitzed with romesco. Sweetness can turn up where it\u2019s not needed, too, whether in the romesco with an unprepossessing pork chop or in the apricot-almond dressing in that chicory salad.\n        \n\n         But if Mr. Flay sometimes lights up the tilt sign on his pinball machine, there is still a lot to love on the menu. There is a lot, period. Gato shows an all-too-rare generosity in its flavors, its eager service, its good-tempered desserts, like the summery blackberry crostata and the fromage blanc cheesecake whipped into a froth by the pastry chef, Clarisa Martino.\n        \n\n         Seeking a decent bottle of wine for $50 or under at an ambitious New York restaurant is becoming a lost cause, but there are more than a dozen of them at Gato. The wine list brings together affordable, everyday bottles with others that will sing their song to advanced drinkers. (It makes a happier hunting ground than the humdrum cocktail menu.)\n        \n\n         Given Mr. Flay\u2019s fan base, the dining room might have been a pack-\u2019em-in nightmare, but there\u2019s space to flex your elbows. The architects at Rockwell Group, past masters at injecting life into big, boxy rooms, have turned this onetime homeless shelter into a flickering lair where the heat-lamp glow of hanging lights is set off against receding pools of darkness. It looks like a set for a TV show about sexy young downtown vampires who unwind over blood sausages \u2014 \u201cCheers\u201d for the undead.\n        \n\n         All the reviews of Gato note that Mr. Flay is really, truly working in the glassed-in kitchen. I saw him, too, not twirling cilantro sprigs at the pass but facing the burners, his back to the audience, like\n         \n\n\n          Miles Davis\n         \n         . He says he\u2019s sticking around indefinitely. Nobody can say he\u2019s giving us anything less than the full Flay.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 149, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/11/dining/restaurant-review-gato-from-bobby-flay.html", "google_mag": 28.0}, {"review_text": "\n         The steak will be here in a minute. First, the show.\n        \n\n         Our server parks a trolley next to a window above Midtown in Quality Italian\u2019s sprawling main dining room. \u201cI\u2019m going to make your steak sauce,\u201d he announces as he drops oregano and parsley leaves into a mortar, cranks the pepper grinder and muscles down on it all with a pestle. \u201cTomato-garlic sauce,\u201d he says, adding three spoonfuls. \u201cNow raisin molasses.\u201d He stirs with a clatter, making as much of a production of it as any mutton-chopped bartender ever made of a julep.\n        \n\n         \u201cThe owner likes us to do things tableside,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a little kitschy, but it\u2019s fun.\u201d\n        \n\n         This would make a reasonably accurate motto for\n         \n          Quality Italian\n         \n         itself. The owners are Michael Stillman; his father, Alan; and Craig Koketsu, whose company,\n         \n          Fourth Wall Restaurants\n         \n         , is bravely battling the creeping solemnity and earnestness of parts of the New York restaurant scene.\n        \n\n         Fourth Wall has one restaurant where not just the menu but the d\u00e9cor and the name\n         \n          change with the seasons\n         \n         (Park Avenue Winter, Park Avenue Spring, etc.) and another that salutes the tiki gods with drinks in watermelons and coconuts (\n         \n          the Hurricane Club\n         \n         ). To the Stillmans, \u201cgimmicky\u201d is a compliment and \u201ctoo gimmicky\u201d is a phrase with no meaning.\n        \n\n         Quality Italian, which opened this summer, is in some ways a clone of Fourth Wall\u2019s steakhouse a block away, Quality Meats, but the executive chef, Scott Tacinelli, has grafted some Italian-American food onto the menu for good measure. The result is, as my server promised, both kitschy and fun, although the food is so uneven you may as well order by spinning a roulette wheel, a gimmick the Stillmans don\u2019t seem to have tried yet.\n        \n\n         This is the restaurant that finally answers the question, \u201cWhat if we set lobster fra diavolo on fire?\u201d Enter a server pushing another trolley. He pours vodka infused with hot Calabrian chiles over a pan of sweet red-pepper sauce. Now the match. The flame climbs the stream of vodka and engulfs the bottle\u2019s neck. It threatens to engulf the server, too, but he\u2019s quick, and there is no damage: neither to his hand, nor to the lobster, which was not stunningly flavorful the night I had it, nor to the sauce, which was.\n        \n\n         At Quality Italian, you don\u2019t get zeppole after dinner. You get a Zeppole Workshop. The pastry chef, Cory Colton, fills a galvanized pail with fried balls of dough and sends them out with a sifter of powdered sugar, a jar of honey with a honey wand, a tiny pitcher of chocolate sauce and a scoop of ricotta ice cream, creamy and not too sweet. You do the rest.\n        \n\n         That\u2019s the kind of work I excel at, especially if it means that I get to skip the Zeppole Workshop\u2019s less exciting cousin, the Cannoli Cart. This is yet another trolley upon which a server stuffs limp wafer shells with a blend of mascarpone and ricotta that is as blandly sugary as canned frosting. After tasting these cannoli, I wanted to flag down another cart to take them away. Better yet would be a swap cart, where you could trade the cannoli for the lovely lemon meringue tart in its rectangle of crisp sugar-crust pastry.\n        \n\n         Even the vegetables perform tricks. Servers stir an egg yolk into bacon-studded kale carbonara, and they crack the glassy surface of caramelized sugar above corn baked in a sweet custard: corn br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Both are preposterously rich, but good. It\u2019s hard to believe the same kitchen that makes these would send out sunchokes roasted to a flavorless, baby-food mush inside deflated skins, little pantyhose-colored bags of regret.\n        \n\n         Distinguishing between entertaining ideas and silly ones is not Quality Italian\u2019s strength. Serving gelati in a paper cup has a Dairy Queen charm, but stamping those cups with the red Safe Handling Instructions label found on meat packages is just bizarre, unless the Stillmans want to educate the public about the risks of E. coli in ice cream. And dressing the female servers in modified French maid outfits may not be the most forward-thinking policy for a restaurant catering to Midtown professionals of both sexes. (Maybe the Stillmans nabbed the idea from\n         \n          Le Relais de Venise\n         \n         , the steakhouse chain, which seems to get away with it by being French.)\n        \n\n         I wanted to believe there was more than kitsch to the chicken parmigiana that looked and acted like a 13-inch pizza. But its shroud of browned cheese was more like\n         \n          Tombstone\n         \n         than\n         \n          Totonno\u2019s\n         \n         ; its fried breading was limp, and after our server had sliced the pizza into wedges with a wheel, the chicken turned out to be spongy ground breast and thigh meat almost completely free of seasoning. Other diners report tasting herbs and salt in the patty, but even that, and a serving that easily feeds two with leftovers (in a pizza box, of course), wouldn\u2019t persuade me to pay $58.\n        \n\n         Luckily, a fair number of dishes don\u2019t do anything but sit there and taste good. Oysters baked under sea urchin butter and bread crumbs are a briny thrill. Nearly as good are the baked clams, with their doubly crunchy topping of bread crumbs and crisp angel-hair pasta.\n        \n\n         Both a filet mignon, tall and proudly alone on an empty white plate, and a sirloin, served on the bone, hit all the classic steakhouse marks, from the glossy, fleshy interior to the matter-of-fact sear. A medium-rare rib chop, though, was inexplicably lean, chewy and dry; almost all the flavor was in the crunchy trimmings left on the bone. Help was not going to come from the steak sauce, drowning in sweetness and clogged with oregano. It could have used some of the energy that a sensational sour-cherry mostarda with fried sage brought to a Berkshire pork chop.\n        \n\n         Pasta dishes have nothing like the finesse they get at\n         \n\n\n          Michael White\n         \n         \u2019s steakhouse,\n         \n          Costata\n         \n         , but the porterhouse agnolotti in brown butter and vincotto had the transfixing depth of dry-aged beef, and the sickle-shaped creste with shrimp in spicy tomato sauce were bright and appealing.\n        \n\n         Finesse may be beside the point at a place where servers proudly tell you that the Quality Burger on the\n         \n          lunch menu\n         \n         is \u201cserved with Quality cheese.\u201d The kitchen needs to work on the first half of the restaurant\u2019s name. But judging by the crowds and the number of times I heard\n         \n\n\n          \u201cHappy Birthday to You,\u201d\n         \n         the Stillmans seem to have figured out that some people would still rather eat in a theater than a church.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 150, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-quality-italian-in-midtown.html", "google_mag": 27.200000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n         Many restaurants station an employee near the door who can make or break your evening. At\n         \n          Somtum Der in the East Village\n         \n         , that person is not a host who may banish you to a table in the frozen wastes of Siberia but a cook who can set your mouth on fire with the flavors of northeastern\n         \n\n\n          Thailand\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         Wearing a T-shirt and a straw hat, he stands behind the bar, surrounded by glass candy-shop jars filled with shallots; heads of garlic; peanuts and cashews; granules of white sugar and little cakes of palm sugar; blistered sticks of fried pork skin; and, crucially, dried bird\u2019s-eye chiles. When an order comes in, he grabs a wooden bat that would come in handy if he were caught in a riot and pounds it against the bottom of a deep wooden mortar. He looks as if he is churning butter. What he is doing is making tart, salty, crisp and exhilaratingly spicy papaya salad.\n        \n\n         Called som tum in Thailand, papaya salad gave its name to this nearly three-month-old restaurant and is its star attraction, made to order in eight variations. One has brined, boiled eggs, which are fluffy and creamy and soothe the burn of the chiles. Another is seasoned with slivers of grilled pork neck, sweet and pink. The one called som tum poo-plara is darker than the rest in color and in flavor because it\u2019s mixed with intensely funky fermented fish sauce and rock-hard miniature crabs scooped up in Thai rice paddies. It was the most complexly rewarding on the roster; the least was the one with rice noodles and sweet chile sauce, which seems to lull the noodles into a shallow, sugary daze.\n        \n\n         Nearly everybody in Thailand loves papaya salad, but the rest of the country got it from Isan, the vast northeastern plateau. Isan probably got it from\n         \n\n\n          Laos\n         \n         , next door, but that\u2019s another story. In stalls all around\n         \n\n\n          Bangkok\n         \n         , street hawkers from Isan pound green papaya, and in 2012 a pair of restaurateurs brought the mortars indoors to a bright and offhandedly stylish place called Somtum Der. Like the Bangkok original, the East Village branch has knotty-pine walls and ceiling fixtures made from bamboo rice steamers and fish traps that could pass for the work of a modern design studio.\n        \n\n         To recap, this is a New York replica of a Bangkok restaurant that interprets that city\u2019s street-food renditions of traditional\n         \n          Isan cooking\n         \n         . Amazingly, the food survives this journey, and if it has lost some herbs and other ingredients, it is still vibrant, fresh and delicious.\n        \n\n         It has picked up a few things, too. Although Isan cuisine is on the march in New York, Thanaruek Laoraowirodge and Supanee Kitmahawong, who own Somtum Der, were worried that the city would wilt under the force of an all-Isan menu. With their consulting chef, Kornthanut Thongnum, they have padded it out with dishes from central Thailand.\n        \n\n         A salad of sardines with mint and improbable quantities of crunchy, fragrant chopped lemon grass is worth a detour from Isan. Somtum Der\u2019s drunken noodles or pad Thai with crab are more than credible, too, if you cannot imagine a Thai meal without those standbys. But they are not why you are here.\n        \n\n         You are here to build an Isan meal around sticky rice, a bowl of soup, a bit of fried or grilled meat and rustic, fiery salads. Very few dishes cost more than $12, and this is one restaurant where the refrain of \u201csmall plates meant for sharing\u201d is not just accurate but culturally appropriate, so order as many as the table can hold. (Or maybe not quite that many. The food launches out of the kitchen quickly and relentlessly, and I felt lost in an avalanche until I learned to order about half of what I meant to eat, and then, when it was gone, put in a second order.)\n        \n\n         You want a larb or two, one of the chopped salads lavished with chiles and mint and a dusting of toasted ground rice that crackles between your teeth. The larbs with chopped duck and pork are very good. The one with crunchy flakes of grilled catfish that soak up the lime and fish sauce is even more satisfying. Another takes the opposite strategy, with minced mushrooms that don\u2019t absorb the dressing at all but quietly allow the fresh herbs and chiles to sing out.\n        \n\n         Animal proteins do not demand the center of the plate in Isan cuisine, and while pork turns up frequently, it\u2019s possible to put together an excellent vegetarian dinner at Somtum Der. Carnivores, though, will want at least one fried or grilled meat. Skewers of beef or pork marinated in coconut milk didn\u2019t hold much interest, but the grilled \u201chouse special\u201d pork did, especially when it was dipped in savory, salty jaew sauce.\n        \n\n         Of the deep-fried dishes splashed across two pages on the full-color picture menu, sun-dried beef and pork with fried leaves of Kaffir lime made an easy-to-crave snack on their own, while the Isan sausages and pork roll worked better as pauses between spicy bites of larb and papaya salad. The restaurant is proud of its chicken thigh under a shower of fried garlic; it might have been wonderful straight out of the oil, but it was distinctly warmed over when I had it.\n        \n\n         Above all, you want papaya salad, absolutely, and you want it as spicy as you can stand. Somtum Der measures heat on a chile-pepper scale, with four chiles denoting a psychotropic level of spice. The cooks don\u2019t always interpret this the same way, even on the same night, but most of the time a four-chile papaya salad will mean five minutes during which you are incapable of doing anything but sweating, squirming, trying to blot your tongue with rice and gulping mouthfuls of\n         \n          Beer Lao\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         A lager from Laos, Beer Lao is a definite notch in quality above Singha, and several notches above Somtum Der\u2019s stabs at Asianesque cocktails.

In that case, there is nothing you can do but wait.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 152, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-somtum-der-in-the-east-village.html", "google_mag": 20.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n         THE HARDEST-WORKING WOMAN in the food business one recent night was the host of Charlie Bird, in SoHo. Armed with nothing but good cheer and a smile that could stop a war, she had the unenviable job of preventing an uprising in a waiting area by the door that might comfortably hold three people if they were very skinny and could survive for minutes at a time without breathing. There were around 10 of us.\n        \n\n         Tables weren\u2019t emptying out as fast as new reservations were arriving, and hungry customers were piling up like rush-hour riders on the platform at Times Square when, \u201cdue to an earlier incident,\u201d the uptown No. 1 is nowhere in sight. \u00a0The earlier incident causing the short delay at Charlie Bird was one that has occurred regularly since the restaurant opened in June: It gets packed early on and stays that way for hours.\n        \n\n         There was no room at the bar, but Robert Bohr, the wine director and an owner, had wedged himself into the tiny foyer to take drink orders, enthusiastically recommending a \u201ctanky\u201d and \u201cgulpable\u201d Piedmontese Barbera from Scarpetta. The host squeezed past him to look at the dining room. As she passed, there was a light pressure on my shoe.\n        \n\n         \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not mean to step on your foot!\u201d\n        \n\n         I had barely noticed, and once she unholstered that smile, I hardly cared. She was one of those servers who can make you feel better after a misstep, even one that lands on your toes, than you would have if nothing had gone wrong in the first place. The tone she set carried through all my meals at Charlie Bird, and it went a long way toward smoothing over any wrinkles. Quick, experienced and friendly, the servers add to the hip-hop-fueled energy of the dining room, which has the slightly too crowded and slightly too loud spirit that keeps people living in New York, even while they gripe about it.\n        \n\n         This was fortunate, because the cooking at Charlie Bird is surprisingly erratic: tremendously likable one moment, strangely off-key the next. Ryan Hardy, the chef and Mr. Bohr\u2019s partner, is working in an eager-to-please Italian mode that leans heavily on cheese, salt and crunch. The kitchen announces its intentions right away with focaccia that is so crisp and shiny with oil that it seems to have been deep-fried. Bits of bread roasted in chicken fat multiply the crunch of a half chicken that Mr. Hardy sears, pressing down on it until the skin crackles.\n        \n\n         Apart from a near-perfect risotto with tiny clams, the soulful mush of Italian cuisine is mostly banished; when a wonderful classic tripe stew turns up, simmered to vanishing softness in tomatoes, Mr. Hardy spoons it over crunchy slices of toast.\n        \n\n         There is a heroic veal chop at Charlie Bird, pounded and floured and browned at scorching heat, but not scorched, served with tender porcini slices and wedges of lemon. There are chopped razor clams that ride in the long canoes of their shells alongside a fiery mash of pickled peppers. A special of bay scallops with chopped pistachios was given little capes of lardo, which may not have been the most flattering look but made the scallops seductively good to eat.\n        \n\n         Jarringly, ingratiating dishes like these were mixed in with careless ones. Some main courses weren\u2019t hot enough, including, on one night, that star chicken. A few of the handmade pastas were standouts; others were washouts. Squid-ink chitarra with too few strands of crab was drowned in oil, and pappardelle with tender veal belly was lost in a weak, watery broth; even $50 worth of white truffles couldn\u2019t coax it to life.\n        \n\n         One evening, the cooks seemed to be applying salt with a snow blower. Salty croutons undid crisp leaves of escarole dressed with anchovies and lemon. Chanterelle pickles and a caper-raisin pur\u00e9e both brought extra salt to a wing of skate that already had more than its share. Dessert could have offered safe haven. But a warm chocolate cake with a molten, sunken center like the crater of a volcano and the olive oil ice cream next to it were topped, sadistically, with much more than a pinch of Maldon salt.\n        \n\n         A few weeks ago, the sodium had been purged from that chocolate volcano and it was the best dessert on the table. If the rest of the menu can shape up, Charlie Bird will be a very good restaurant. The other pieces are already in place.\n        \n\n         The narrow space, essentially a split-level bowling alley that runs along Avenue of the Americas, has been made over as a modern bistro, with squash-colored banquettes and\n         \n          Lyle Owerko\u2019s blown-up photographs\n         \n         of vintage boomboxes shot like Avedon portraits. The music is carefully aged hip-hop. Over the summer the decibel level could have been classed as an enhanced interrogation technique, although if it elicited any confessions nobody would have heard them. Acoustic retrofitting and a lower volume setting have helped.\n        \n\n         Mr. Bohr, who built the epic wine list at\n         \n          Cru\n         \n         , keeps a much shorter one at Charlie Bird. Working with one of his sommeliers, Grant Reynolds, he has assembled it with such care\u00a0 that I fell hard for everything I tasted. Ordinarily I\u2019d be put off by seeing more bottles over $100 than under in such a casual place, but the markups are kind and, if your curiosity outstrips your budget, you can buy a half bottle of anything except sparkling wines for half the price. Even the cheapest wines were exciting, like the grignolino from the Piedmontese producer Cavallotto. \u00a0At $45, it cost less than the retail price of the handblown glass it was served in, which had a crystal stem as thin as a chive.\n        \n\n         Like\n         \n          Pearl & Ash\n         \n         , another downtown restaurant that opened this year, Charlie Bird is on a mission to make the thoughtful wine service that you used to find only in hushed, special-occasion restaurants into an everyday event. That philosophy shapes the whole meal. Servers watch the tiny details, the way they do at far more formal restaurants, but they\u2019re loose and relaxed. It\u2019s a style ideally suited for the way we go to restaurants now, and it would lure me back, once the kitchen becomes more consistent, even if I have to wear steel-toed shoes.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 153, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-charlie-bird-in-soho.html", "google_mag": 18.899999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n         Chances are you haven\u2019t seen a picture of the roasted chicken at\n         \n          Betony\n         \n         . If you have, you\u2019ve probably forgotten it, because it is just a gracefully tapering triangle of meat with golden skin. A purple-stemmed dandelion leaf lies on top of it, chanterelles and Hakurei turnips huddle at its side, a pool of jus gathers around it on a bone-white plate. In the race to become the most photographed cooked bird in the history of New York, it is no threat to the one at the NoMad.\n        \n\n         Once you taste Betony\u2019s, though, you aren\u2019t likely to forget it. None of the things that are supposed to taste like chicken do. Neither does most chicken, for that matter. This does, in a way that seems pure and undoctored.\n        \n\n         We taste flavors this clear when we\u2019re in the hands of a chef who obsesses over a dozen details of the kind that don\u2019t show up in a photograph. The chef at Betony is Bryce Shuman. Chances are you haven\u2019t seen much of his name yet, either, but you will.\n        \n\n         Mr. Shuman worked under Daniel Humm at Eleven Madison Park for almost six years, rising to executive sous-chef. For Betony, which opened on West 57th Street in Midtown this spring, he teamed up with a former captain from Eleven Madison Park, Eamon Rockey, now Betony\u2019s general manager. The wine director, Luke Wohlers, is another veteran.\n        \n\n         As you\u2019d imagine, the two restaurants bear a family resemblance. The dining room staff, in crisp black and white, has the same military posture, which makes it that much more gratifying when they smile. Some of the E.M.P. ESP has made its way uptown, too. Servers often seemed to know what I needed before I did, although I\u2019m not sure that my copy of\n         \n\n\n          The New Yorker\n         \n         required its own purse stool.\n        \n\n         Traces of Mr. Humm\u2019s style, minus the party tricks, show up in Mr. Shuman\u2019s cooking, especially in the way that the signs of hard work have been tucked out of sight. Betony\u2019s food has been fussed over, but it isn\u2019t fussy.\n        \n\n         The greatest appetizer, and this is a hard call, is a slice of seared foie gras under a crisp kale leaf. Plugged into the middle of the foie gras like a pink bullet is a circle of smoked pork hocks. A server pours a consomm\u00e9 made from the hocks over the top. That\u2019s it: liver, kale, ham broth, ham and some pickled black garlic. It is the most soulful foie gras I\u2019ve ever tasted.\n        \n\n         Mr. Shuman makes a prettier, more conventional foie gras terrine and serves it with ripe berries, but I won\u2019t remember it as long as the hot foie gras dish, or even the chicken liver mousse. The mousse makes an unseductive entrance as a satiny ball that is a disquieting, back-of-the-refrigerator shade of green. Under the surface, which gets its color from parsley and its sheen from schmaltz, is a big scoop of whipped chicken liver that is almost as smooth and luxurious as the foie gras. It came with toast that I kept forgetting to use; \u00a0I got all the crunch I needed by dragging the liver mousse through a trail of fried chicken skin and caraway-rye crumbs, and all the sweetness from a bright pur\u00e9e of green apples and chervil.\n        \n\n         Chicken liver spread, schmaltz, gribenes, seeded rye, apples, parsley: Is it Rosh Hashana already? Many of Mr. Shuman\u2019s dishes have familiar echoes like this. The pleasure they give you isn\u2019t exactly discovery. It\u2019s more like rediscovery.\n        \n\n         You already know that shellfish gets along with dill, but do you know that when you take impossibly tender and fresh lobster and cover it with a sauce that\u2019s been poured through tied bunches of fresh dill until the scent of the herb fills your lungs, you get something really wonderful?\n        \n\n         And, of course, you know that the browned hunks of fat on the edge of dry-aged beef can be a treat. But do you know what happens if you melt that fat and stew a short rib in it for two days, then sear the rib over white-hot charcoal? Mr. Shuman knows, and I\u2019ll bet that a year from now other chefs will know, too. Accessorized with grilled romaine and one perfectly fried sweetbread, it\u2019s a dish worth stealing.\n        \n\n         Betony\u2019s desserts, a collaboration between Mr. Shuman and Rebecca Isbell, the pastry sous-chef, don\u2019t land with the same force that the appetizers and main courses do. They\u2019re more scattered, although that complaint seems academic when you\u2019re eating a chocolate cr\u00e9meux whose flavors build and subside like a red wine, or chasing a red plum with a mouthful of spongecake drenched in perilla-plum syrup.\n        \n\n         My misgivings about the rest of the menu are mild ones. Warm tomatillo juice with a poached black bass fillet needed a sharper edge. And a cucumber salad with a last-minute application of pulverized frozen buttermilk that sent puffs of fog into the air and made the table look like a M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce video was fun for a minute, but the flavors weren\u2019t deep enough for the long haul.\n        \n\n         With almost every other dish, though, Mr. Shuman builds tastes that you want to keep going back to as long as you can. A dissident faction of eaters never bought the idea that all dishes larger than three or four bites become boring. When these people taste something they love, they don\u2019t feel boredom. They just want more.\n        \n\n         I suspect these people will descend on Betony with ravenous relief. Other diners may go once and never return because the elegance of the food and service are seriously out of joint with the space. The restaurant was originally built by its owner, Andrey Dellos, as Brasserie Pushkin, a Russian cafe with deliriously gaudy d\u00e9cor and food that seemed intended to remind wealthy expatriates why they had left the old country. When that concept failed, Mr. Dellos turned it into Betony, carting off the busty gilded caryatids and the murals of celestial nudes that seemed to be painted with pink cupcake frosting.\n        \n\n         But he left the ornate molded panels that almost look like real wood. And he left the cafe\u2019s basic layout, with a soaring bar so dramatic it manages to make both of the dining rooms, one upstairs and one down, feel like Siberia. The bar, with first-rate cocktails and clever if insubstantial snacks, hasn\u2019t completely caught on yet. If it does, it could make the diners in back feel even more cut off. It\u2019s a nontrivial problem, but it is treatable under an architect\u2019s care.\n        \n\n         But what would most help that dining room right now is a crowd. Betony deserves it.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 154, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/28/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-betony-in-midtown.html", "google_mag": 21.299999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n         A few opulent restaurants opened right after the economy fell apart in 2008, like guests who pound on the door long after the lights have been turned out and the hosts have gone to bed. The rest of the city looked up from a collective hangover at their flashy outfits and expectant smiles and said, \u201cUm, the party\u2019s kind of over, dude.\u201d\n        \n\n         Armani Ristorante, inside the Armani store on Fifth Avenue in Midtown, was one of those late arrivals. The mood in the city was humbled, downsized, frightened, and here was an expensive restaurant reached by a private elevator from the street or, better, a sinuous white ramp that twisted past two floors of gowns and luxury leather goods like a floating catwalk. After a lunch there in early 2009, Frank Bruni, then the\n         \n\n\n          New York Times\n         \n         restaurant critic,\n         \n          wrote a blog post\n         \n         noting that \u201cthe whole thing just feels sort of tone-deaf and odd.\u201d He never reviewed the restaurant, which seemed likely to end up in the same landfill where they\u2019d deposited the carcass of\n         \n\n\n          Lehman Brothers\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         Some people\u2019s money is more durable than others\u2019, though.\n         \n\n\n          Giorgio Armani\n         \n         apparently kept pumping his into the restaurant, his first in New York.\n        \n\n         Here it is today, as another\n         \n\n\n          New York Fashion Week\n         \n         sashays to a close. The restaurant\u2019s kitchen is now under Sandro Romano, who arrived last spring after seven years as chef de cuisine at\n         \n          the Modern\n         \n         . The catwalk is intact, and tiny blue and purple lights still twinkle in the windows over Fifth Avenue. The white circular booths with black leather tops are still there, too, looking like the\n         \n          Mad Tea Party ride\n         \n         at\n         \n\n\n          Disney\n         \n         World, transported to Armani World.\n        \n\n         Dolled up like that, Armani Ristorante will always be somewhat odd. But since the stock indexes hit record highs in August, it hasn\u2019t seemed quite as tone deaf. With main courses averaging around $35, it is cheaper than (don\u2019t laugh)\n         \n          Carbone\n         \n         , and in the same range as some Upper East Side Italian stalwarts where the cooking and service aren\u2019t as refined. If the prices are out of touch, then so are large patches of\n         \n\n\n          Manhattan\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         Yes, if you ask for sparkling water, you will get Acqua Armani. Does the bottle, skinny as a fashion editor and stamped with a big block A, justify $11? I\u2019d say no, but I\u2019d say yes to the wine list, which has a surprisingly generous number of wines under $50. One night while I was scanning the Southern Italian whites, a sommelier materialized at my elbow and pointed right away to a crisp and sunny Sicilian grillo for $39. You\u2019d have trouble matching that price at some downtown joints that pass as inexpensive.\n        \n\n         The sommelier did this without making me feel like a cheapskate. Another server showed similar discretion one night when a woman at my table immediately peeled back the glittering silver skin from a branzino fillet. \u201cAh, but that\u2019s where all the flavor is,\u201d he protested briefly, then flashed a wide smile that beamed understanding.\n        \n\n         He was right about the skin. It was the best part of a lovely dish, its slight fattiness offset by cracked pink peppercorns and sage. Mr. Romano sets the fish on a green circle of Italian salsa verde made from arugula and fresh herbs blended with olive oil. The bright taste of the raw greens is just what this mild but meaty fish needs.\n        \n\n         Mr. Romano has a sensitive hand with seafood. It was on display on a long plate that held five raw tastes of the ocean, like branzino dyed purple by a bath in beet juice, and a sweet, firm langoustine with tart little bits of green apple.\n        \n\n         He mimics the look of seared sea scallops with short stacks of meltingly rich potato gratin. Shaved black truffles looked dramatic but didn\u2019t follow through with the expected flavor; all the pleasure was in the gentle interplay of the potatoes and scallops. The only seafood letdown was baby octopus, which had even less flavor than the truffles. Remarkably good polenta was wasted on those bland little legs.\n        \n\n         Pasta was a trickier proposition. Lasagnetta, a tower of roasted eggplant slices layered with tomato sauce, smoked scamorza and fresh pasta rolled very thin, was a little like eggplant Parmesan and a little like lasagna, but more delicate than either, getting restrained richness from basil oil and a Parmigiano-Reggiano sauce.\n        \n\n         Spaghetti and shaved dried tuna roe, on the other hand, got no help from slabs of tuna belly that were as mushy as a black banana. And green tagliolini was overdressed with a muddle of mushrooms and truffles and two whole langoustines dropped in the center of the bowl. Removing one accessory,\n         \n\n\n          Coco Chanel\n         \n         -style, would have focused the flavors and helped lower the ridiculous $38 price tag.\n        \n\n         I chalked both misfires up to an off night. They and other dishes didn\u2019t have the same sparkle I\u2019d seen on my other two visits, making me wonder if Mr. Romano is still consolidating control over the kitchen.\n        \n\n         His menu is at its best when it takes its cues from the understated style of\n         \n\n\n          Milan\n         \n         , Mr. Armani\u2019s base of power. The rice in black risotto with speck-wrapped cuttlefish had precisely the firm but creamy texture it should. And when the bone-in veal chop Milanese showed up, I just sat there smiling for a minute because I could tell from the gorgeous, tanned crust how much fun I was going to have eating it.\n        \n\n         Apart from gravity-bound bomboloni, the desserts were worth giving up any dreams I might have of fitting into something sold by Armani other than\n         \n          a sofa\n         \n         . There is a fine molten chocolate cake, called a fondente, with an espresso gelato that has the licorice kick of Sambuca. A puff of raspberry mousse and tongues of meringue topped a barely set panna cotta. My favorite was the least traditional: an after-dinner salad of strawberries, and inky balsamic vinegar with micro-wedges of tomato and a refreshing basil gelato.\n        \n\n         While the prices aren\u2019t quite so out of step with the times, nobody would describe Armani Ristorante as of the moment. The tiny colored lights and view above the sidewalks always reminded me of two places from an earlier era: \u00a0Windows on the World and\n         \n          the revolving lounge\n         \n         at the top of the Marriott Marquis in Times Square.

An old farm recipe, green tomato pie was new to me when I ate a small wedge of it at a very likable\n         \n\n\n          Brooklyn\n         \n         restaurant called\n         \n          Delaware and Hudson\n         \n         two weeks ago. Now I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. Double-crusted like an apple pie, bobbing between sweet and savory, it had the herbaceousness and tang of unripe tomatoes and the very old-timey flavor of molasses and brown sugar. The ingredients combined in ways that had me tasting spices that weren\u2019t, in fact, in there.\n        \n\n         Patti Jackson, the restaurant\u2019s chef and owner, called the recipe \u201can agglomeration of Pennsylvania Dutch and Shaker pies, stuff that\u2019s always interested me.\u201d At this point, it\u2019s hard to find a New York chef who doesn\u2019t cook with ingredients from the mid-Atlantic, but ones who draw on the region\u2019s recipes are much more unusual.\n        \n\n\n\n\n          Delaware\n         \n         and Hudson, which opened in May, looks the part of the contemporary Brooklyn restaurant that preaches all things local and seasonal. The tables are bare wood. The ceiling rafters are exposed. Pickle jars sit above the kitchen door. The walls are pinned with glamour shots of farmers\u2019 market bins piled with strawberries and purple-tipped asparagus.\n        \n\n         The restaurant stands out from the pack, though, in part because Ms. Jackson draws on the traditions of long-gone Americans who would have been amazed to hear that farm-to-table would become a slogan one day. Old-time regional recipes (\u201cfrom\n         \n\n\n          Baltimore\n         \n         to\n         \n\n\n          Buffalo\n         \n         ,\u201d says a sign by the door) flit on and off her weekly menus. They don\u2019t define the restaurant\u2019s cooking, though. Ms. Jackson does. Her four-course $48 set menus are drawn from her life, and their personal point of view helps make Delaware and Hudson so winning.\n        \n\n         She grew up in Clarks Summit, Pa., close enough to Pennsylvania Dutch country to know how a fresh pretzel ought to taste. You\u2019ll know, too, because the first thing to land on the table after you choose your main course is a galvanized pail of hot pretzel rolls, boiled in lye and studded with white salt crystals, like Amish rhinestones. The chewy, yeasty pretzels were wonderful smeared with ramp butter or a green mash of fava hummus that came out alongside breakfast radishes and crisp, cool slices of fennel.\n        \n\n         Putting herself through culinary school in Baltimore, Ms. Jackson cooked at\n         \n          the Harvey House restaurant\n         \n         for Rose Baumel, known to all as Miss Rose.\n        \n\n         \u201cMiss Rose was in the kitchen every single day in a housekeeper\u2019s dress,\u201d she recalled. \u201cShe did all the money and all the liquor, and when it was time to do the crab cakes, all the guys in the kitchen would prepare separate parts of it for her and she would go off in a corner and secretly mix it all together.\u201d\n        \n\n         Ms. Baumel\u2019s precise formula probably disappeared along with the restaurant\u2019s sign, a rabbit in purple neon, but the young cooking student watched closely enough to have her own ideas. Delaware and Hudson served Miss Rose\u2019s crab cakes in June on top of hollandaise with purslane leaves. They were precisely the golden pan-fried patties of clean white crab meat, just barely holding together, that I see whenever I look at a blue crab.\n        \n\n         Pretzel rolls followed by three other small dishes, like the crab cakes or a hungry farmhand\u2019s salad of string beans and creamy new potatoes in vinegar and warm bacon fat, are the appetizer course. Next comes handmade pasta, and dinner suddenly veers toward\n         \n\n\n          Italy\n         \n         . This is inconsistent with the stated theme of the restaurant, but consistent with the life of Ms. Jackson. She was the chef at a string of Italian restaurants in\n         \n\n\n          Manhattan\n         \n         \u2014\n         \n          Le Madri\n         \n         ,\n         \n          I Trulli\n         \n         and\n         \n          Centovini\n         \n         \u2014 and she knows her way around a pasta roller. In June, sweet pea ravioli had delicate thin-skinned wrappers, perfectly formed little flying saucers in a butter sauce with slivers of\n         \n\n\n          Virginia\n         \n         ham. Her fresh spaghetti in a quick sauce of ripe tomatoes and basil dotted with milky ricotta got the dish, which often goes wrong, exactly right.\n        \n\n         Ms. Jackson\u2019s food doesn\u2019t have the buzz-cut professionalism of some restaurant food, which seems to have been produced by Adderall-chewing line cooks who practice their brunoise in front of a mirror while listening to\n         \n          \u201cEye of the Tiger.\u201d\n         \n         Her cooking has a more relaxed, informal air.\n        \n\n         This is its charm and sometimes its weakness, too. Earthy and delicious noodles made from einkorn wheat and fresh herbs were clumped together one night, as if the noodles had not been sauced soon enough. A vegetarian main course called corn mush was as dense and bland as a bowl of hot cereal you made at breakfast and forgot about until lunch. Corn pudding was a nicer variation on this idea, sweet kernels of corn baked into a soft, custardy dome of cornmeal. But the ratatouille served with it wasn\u2019t the usual soft, sweet melting pot of summer; the vegetables were still half-crisp and noticeably bitter.\n        \n\n         These slumps may soften my recommendation, but they weren\u2019t enough to knock any of my meals seriously off-track. Any bad impressions were wiped out by a half-dozen good ones, by a duck breast with rhubarb or a hunk of wild striped bass with yellow cherry tomatoes cooked just until they wilted. Servers were stiff in the beginning, marching around with one hand awkwardly ratcheted up behind their backs as if their wrists were attached to bungee cords, but they are more at ease now, giving the restaurant a friendliness that can make you think you have traveled much farther than 10 steps from Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg.\n        \n\n         Then, a pair of desserts, small and homey, like a warm button of steamed chocolate cake next to a miniature peach shortcake. Why two desserts? Why four appetizers? I think it\u2019s the generosity implied by the out-of-print cookbooks Ms. Jackson reads, by the spirit of places like the Harvey House, by the old way of cooking to fill people up and make them happy at the same time.\n        \n\n         Finally, a plate of four mignardises arrives. There may be a chocolate-caramel candy and a one-bite macaron infused with the taste of ripe Tristar strawberries. The plate is always delivered by Ms. Jackson with the smile good cooks have when they know everyone will leave the table happy.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 156, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/dining/restaurant-review-delaware-and-hudson.html", "google_mag": 22.200000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n         If you remember David Waltuck\u2019s cooking at Chanterelle, eating at his new restaurant,\n         \n\n\n          \u00c9lan\n         \n         , can be a little unnerving. Chanterelle, a downtown pioneer when it opened in 1979, was an institution by the time\n         \n          it went out of business\n         \n         , just a few months short of its 30th anniversary.\n        \n\n         Like all institutions, it had become padded by ritual, tradition and reputation. You went there to eat, of course, but you also went because it was supposed to be one of the city\u2019s greatest restaurants, holding\n         \n          four stars\n         \n         from\n         \n\n\n          The New York Times\n         \n\n          at various points\n         \n         . You went to find out whether the artist who had drawn the cover of the handwritten menu would be at the next table. You went because Karen Waltuck, the chef\u2019s wife and partner, and her ballet corps of elegant, mildly bohemian servers knew how to make you comfortable even if grand restaurants like Chanterelle weren\u2019t usually your thing.\n        \n\n         At\n         \n          \u00c9lan\n         \n         , which Mr. Waltuck opened with\n         \n\n\n          George Stinson\n         \n         north of Union Square this summer, the institutional padding is gone. Restaurants like Chanterelle have a wine directory the size and mass of the Oxford English Dictionary, but \u00c9lan\u2019s fits on four very tempting pages of reds and whites up to $105, with a short appendix of more-expensive bottles under the heading \u201ctreat yourself.\u201d The one reminder of Mr. Waltuck\u2019s downtown-bohemian past is the quintuple self-portrait by\n         \n\n\n          Chuck Close\n         \n         that hangs opposite the wide concrete bar, a black curtain from which disembodied Close heads stare grimly out of the darkness, like a trick in a haunted house.\n        \n\n         The monochromatic dining room is attractive enough, but a little too bright by night when the pinpoint lights beam straight down. Look along the banquette, and you see a row of shiny, illuminated noses. A heavy framed mirror seems to be suspended by a thick white rope, which somehow makes it look less secure. It\u2019s a reasonably quiet room, friendly to conversation, but not one whose innate beauty will draw you back. There is, in other words, little in the environment for the food to hide behind. Standing out in the open, Mr. Waltuck\u2019s cooking is revealed to be as variable, as prone to peaks and valleys, as anyone else\u2019s.\n        \n\n         This may rattle the Chanterelle sentimentalists, but it seems to have liberated Mr. Waltuck. A chef with stars to defend and a reputation to maintain does what politicians do in close elections: sticks to the script, tries to stay predictable. At \u00c9lan, Mr. Waltuck gets to play. He doesn\u2019t have to ask himself whether a pair of pot stickers filled with mashed potatoes can be a four-star dish. That\u2019s a boring question. The point is that finding potatoes inside crimped pan-fried dumplings surrounded by a haze of shaved summer truffles is a funny, delicious surprise. He must be playing, too, when he stirs sea urchin into a deep bowl of guacamole. Avocado doesn\u2019t need extra creaminess, but it takes extremely well to briny seafood, as you find out when you spread some on a grease-free taro chip.\n        \n\n         Occasionally, what seems like a fun idea will land like a bag of wet laundry. Foie gras lollipops sound decadent, but the cold wad of dull liver rolled in uncrunchy pistachios is a grim treat. General Tso\u2019s sweetbreads are another game gone wrong. If the sweetbreads were ever crisp, they aren\u2019t by the time they\u2019ve been stir-fried with bok choy and sloshed around in an orange-chile sauce that seemed to need more spice and citrus tang. (This dish may fall into one of my blind spots, because the Chinese takeout classic doesn\u2019t ring my doorbell, either.)\n        \n\n         Servers at \u00c9lan will announce conspiratorially that there is an \u201coff the menu special,\u201d a burger of duck and foie gras, even though it\u2019s always available. The whispered hard sell is a tired ploy to begin with, and this slightly mushy pile of meat sweetened with onion chutney and figs isn\u2019t spectacular enough to make the gimmick pay off. At times, \u00c9lan seems a little unfocused, as if Mr. Waltuck is hedging his bets by combining a grown-up bistro with a gastro pub in the crazed-carnivore style of the past decade. One of \u00c9lan\u2019s least pleasant dishes is scallop fettuccine dressed with a sauce that seems to be pure duck fat. After one forkful, I wanted a salad.\n        \n\n         Fashions have changed since Chanterelle closed, of course, but \u00c9lan is at its best when it is not trying to keep up with the youngsters. The mere sight of tea-smoked salmon on the menu may cause Asian fusion flashbacks. (Enormous Buddhas! Chopsticks as hairpins! Raw tuna served over bowls of live Siamese fighting fish!) But Mr. Waltuck\u2019s salmon is no throwback. It is silky and elegant, given a sweet-sour depth by a lightly curried tamarind sauce.\n        \n\n         The dish that made Mr. Waltuck\u2019s name, the seafood sausage in which sweet bits of scallops and shrimp are bound together by a subtle fish mousse, is back, looking hopelessly behind the times in its sauerkraut beurre blanc. Do not be fooled: It is also one of the most delicious things at \u00c9lan. I enjoyed Mr. Waltuck\u2019s steamed zucchini blossoms at Chanterelle and enjoyed them again at \u00c9lan, where they were stuffed with zucchini and Parmesan and served with slow-cooked tomatoes and very fresh, clean-tasting lemon cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. With dishes that call for lightness and delicacy, \u00c9lan comes into its own.\n        \n\n         The menu changes all the time, and at every meal, one or two recipes seemed to need more time in the test kitchen. A red-wine butter sauce with striped bass was very vague, as if it needed to be reduced longer. But a special I had the same night, fluffy fish quenelles bobbing in an aromatic Thai soup, skillfully combined Mr. Waltuck\u2019s longstanding love for Asian traditions with his habit of jumping outside tradition when the mood strikes.\n        \n\n         Diana Valenzuela, the pastry chef, seems to work the same way. She will be zigging in one direction, then she\u2019ll zag left on you. Panna cotta with Concord grape jam and fragile sheets of pine-nut brittle starts like dessert but ends like a cheese course; Ms. Valenzuela makes the panna cotta from Gorgonzola. A pastis-soaked chocolate cake might have been more interesting if it hadn\u2019t been topped with an oddly waxy chocolate mousse. But a swatch of basil pastry cream is an unexpected and excellent addition to blueberries in a thin, crisp corn-flour tart shell. Ms. Valenzuela\u2019s desserts are just right for a restaurant that takes the predictability out of tradition.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 157, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/dining/restaurant-review-elan-in-the-flatiron-district.html", "google_mag": 26.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n         Galleries owned by\n         \n\n\n          Larry Gagosian\n         \n         , the powerful and well-connected dealer who has spent his career goosing the prices of contemporary art higher and higher: 14.\n        \n\n         Restaurants owned by the chef Masayoshi Takayama, who has spent his career charging more for Japanese food than anyone else in the\n         \n\n\n          United States\n         \n         : five.\n        \n\n         Restaurants the two men own together: one,\n         \n          Kappo Masa\n         \n         , in the basement below Mr.\n         \n\n\n          Gagosian\n         \n         \u2019s Madison Avenue gallery. The dining room, furnished with teak tables and seating upholstered in buttercup-yellow leather, wraps in an L shape around the large, well-populated kitchen. Mr. Takayama is known for sushi, but Kappo Masa presents a general overview of Japanese cuisine, so in addition to the raw-fish counter, there are stations for grilling, frying, simmering, steaming and assembling marinated seafood plates and cold salads. He runs the kitchen himself, but I failed to spot him.\n        \n\n         Now three months old, Kappo Masa is not the most expensive restaurant in New York. That distinction belongs to Mr. Takayama\u2019s home base,\n         \n          Masa\n         \n         , in the\n         \n\n\n          Time Warner\n         \n         Center. (Price of dinner for one before\n         \n\n\n          tax\n         \n         , tip and drinks: $450.) Still, it is expensive in a way that\u2019s hard to forget either during or after the meal. The cost of eating at Kappo Masa is so brutally, illogically, relentlessly high, and so out of proportion to any pleasure you may get, that large numbers start to seem like uninvited and poorly behaved guests at the table.\n        \n\n         Price of a maki roll of chopped fatty tuna wrapped in rice with caviar piled on each of the eight pieces: $240. I could never bring myself to order it, or two dishes filigreed with white truffles: the fried rice with mushrooms ($120) or the Ohmi beef tataki ($150). So I can\u2019t tell you how any of them taste, but I can tell you that by the time I spotted something for less than $80, it struck me as a steal.\n        \n\n         Amount I spent for 5.5 ounces of grilled steak raised in\n         \n\n\n          Australia\n         \n         : $78.\n        \n\n         The beef had a species of tenderness that I associate more with bluefin tuna than steak. It tasted something like teriyaki without the sugar. I liked it very much, but mostly I thought, \u201cWhy $78?\u201d\n        \n\n         In fact, Mr. Takayama charges similar prices across town at\n         \n          Bar Masa\n         \n         . But the food and service allow Bar Masa to pass for an \u00e0 la carte version of Masa itself. Kappo Masa is nowhere near as good. The raw ingredients may well be the same, but they are often handled carelessly, seasoned indifferently and served inattentively.\n        \n\n         Price of bland, watery cauliflower florets with maitake mushrooms that were grilled over far too much heat so their insides were raw and woody while their exteriors was burned to a char that peeled off in blackened flakes: $28.\n        \n\n         Price of yellowtail collar left on the grill until it lost the silky, puddinglike richness that is the whole point of this cut: $28.\n        \n\n         Price of noodles extruded from ground shrimp, a gluten-free invention of Mr. Takayama\u2019s, sloshing around in a greasy pond of way too much melted butter and not enough of the serrano chiles that may have given the dish a little spark: $24.\n        \n\n         Price of four tiny, cold flour tortillas filled with roast duck, floppy matchsticks of uncrisp duck skin and batons of overcooked foie gras: $26.\n        \n\n         Every once in a while, something genuinely remarkable would arrive, as if from another kitchen. Cubes of superb raw tuna ($34), seasoned with soy, sake and minced wasabi, were served polar-vortex-cold on a chilled white ceramic drum designed by Mr. Takayama. Butterflied grilled octopus ($24), soft and a little smoky in its dressing of sesame oil and lime, was something like Japanese shrimp scampi, a terrific surprise. There was \u201cbaby dancing shrimp,\u201d in a shattering, exquisite batter dusted with ground chiles ($26), and a sea urchin risotto with springy grains of rice, some very fresh chanterelles and almost enough urchin to silence any protests about the price ($48).\n        \n\n         If the whole meal were like this, Kappo Masa would be a fantastic splurge. It\u2019s not, though, and those prices start to seem like very expensive lottery tickets. They got into my head in other ways, too, warping my normal sense of value.\n        \n\n         Menu price for cress with wasabi dressing: $18.\n        \n\n         Amount I paid: $38, making this the first restaurant where I have actually looked over the check before paying and missed a $20 overcharge for a salad. I hadn\u2019t been drinking that night, either. If I had, I might have become even more numbed to gouging.\n        \n\n         Approximate retail price of a bottle of 2012\n         \n\n\n          Napa Valley\n         \n         chardonnay from Far Niente: $55.\n        \n\n         Price of the same bottle at Kappo Masa: $190.\n        \n\n         This was typical. The markup that New York restaurants customarily add to retail wine and sake prices is about 150 percent. The average markup at Kappo Masa is 200 percent to 300 percent. And I don\u2019t need to shop around town to know that a cocktail of unnamed vodka infused with pineapple, even if it is as fresh tasting as Kappo Masa\u2019s, should not cost $25.\n        \n\n         It doesn\u2019t seem possible that Mr. Gagosian and Mr. Takayama just made up these prices out of thin air, diabolically chortling like Batman villains, late one evening at Masa. (Number of times each month Mr. Gagosian eats there, by his estimate: two.) And yet if you are one of those people who suspects that\n         \n\n\n          Manhattan\n         \n         is being remade as a private playground for millionaires who either don\u2019t mind spending hundreds of dollars for mediocrity or simply can\u2019t tell the difference, Kappo Masa is not going to convince you that you\u2019re wrong.\n        \n\n         Superficially, the servers seem to belong in a restaurant offering casual luxury. They can act out a solemn, respectful greeting or a deep genuflection of apology. What they don\u2019t always do is care.\n        \n\n         Servers who rushed to our side and fluttered about and acted distressed after one of them bumped a votive candle off the table\u2019s edge: three.\n        \n\n         Servers who asked if anyone had been hit by the candle or checked to see if we had wax on our clothes: zero.\n        \n\n         Also, bowing at one side of the table holding a cocktail menu open may have broadcast a desire to please, but it made the text impossible to read. When I asked which \u201clong-stem mushrooms\u201d came with the grilled asparagus, the server very obligingly promised to ask the kitchen but never returned with the answer.\n        \n\n         One night the standard finger napkins didn\u2019t appear until halfway through the sushi course. A restaurant of Mr. Takayama\u2019s that forgets how to serve sushi seems unthinkable, but then the sushi itself was no prize. The rice was a gummy clump (though, on another visit, it was close to perfect).\n        \n\n         Kappo Masa provides a pantomime of service without the substance, and the restaurant itself is an imitation of luxury, not the real thing.\n        \n\n         Stars I might have given Kappo Masa if the prices were, say, 20 percent lower: one.\n        \n\n         Stars I am giving it: zero.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 158, "rating": "Satisfactory", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/dining/restaurant-review-kappo-masa-on-the-upper-east-side.html", "google_mag": 29.299999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n         A normal sandwich was what I had in mind one day in January. Normal is not what\n         \n          Meat Hook Sandwich\n         \n         does, though, so I ended up eating something that I would call the greatest cheeseburger I\u2019ve ever tasted if not for the inconvenient fact that it wasn\u2019t a cheeseburger. What I ate was a chopped cheese sandwich, also known \u2014 in the very small patch of the\n         \n\n\n          United States\n         \n         where it is known at all \u2014 as chop cheese.\n        \n\n         This sandwich rarely strays from its natural habitat, the bodegas of\n         \n\n\n          Harlem\n         \n         and the\n         \n\n\n          Bronx\n         \n         . Filled with griddled ground beef in a cloak of melted American cheese, it is a distant relative of the\n         \n\n\n          Philadelphia\n         \n         cheesesteak and of the tavern sandwich, an\n         \n\n\n          Iowa\n         \n         standby that also goes by the irresistible name \u201cloose meat.\u201d In Williamsburg,\n         \n\n\n          Brooklyn\n         \n         , Meat Hook Sandwich stirs in some pickle relish and piles the meat-cheese-relish amalgam onto a sesame-seed semolina roll. The relish makes every bite spicy and sweet, while the cheese makes the meat, already potent and rich, extra hot and slick. The architecture of the chopped cheese avoids a common if generally overlooked flaw of many cheeseburgers: the tendency of the cheese to drift upward from the patty and incorporate itself into the upper bun.\n        \n\n         Discovering this rearranged cheeseburger at the sandwich shop should not have been a shock. The place opened last year as a satellite of\n         \n          the Meat Hook\n         \n         , a butcher store a few blocks away whose bacon-cheeseburger sausage has made numerous and rewarding (for me) trips from the display case to my grill. Behind the counter, brawny women and men are always breaking down entire hogs and sides of beef from livestock raised on virtuous nearby farms. The economics of whole-animal butchery demand ingenuity in selling off the less-popular cuts and scraps. House-made cold cuts were an obvious sideline. As mortadella, ham and p\u00e2t\u00e9 amassed, the omens began to gesture toward sandwiches.\n        \n\n         The Meat Hook\u2019s restaurant, on Lorimer Street, does not look expensively decorated; the neon sign spelling \u201csandwich\u201d in big white block capitals was a hand-me-down from another sandwich business. This hangs on one of two brick walls painted white. Fourteen backless metal stools surround exactly three tables. Sandwiches are ordered at a counter and delivered to the table in red plastic baskets. This is the extent of what you would call \u201cservice,\u201d except on Wednesday nights, when $25 buys a Meat Hook steak, an accompaniment (sometimes a salad) and as many bottles of cheap beer as you can drink without calling attention to yourself. The beers, Miller High Life or Pacifico, are carried to the dining room by a butcher moonlighting as a cook doubling as a waiter.\n        \n\n         The sandwich concern was founded by three pillars of the butcher shop: Brent Young, a\n         \n\n\n          Pittsburgh\n         \n         native with a lifelong hoagie fixation; Ben Turley, a rehabilitated restaurant cook; and Tom Mylan, who recently wriggled off the Meat Hook. They put a veteran Brooklyn chef named Gil Calderon in charge of the kitchen. Try to picture the lunch a hungry young butcher would dream about after spending the morning hunched over a large animal with a hacksaw, and you have a good idea what you are in for. There are no elegant tricorner panini, and nothing you can eat with one hand while holding a pinot grigio in the other. The cooks listen to their lizard brains.\n        \n\n         Simultaneously, a higher sandwich intelligence is at work, one that understands the crucial role of contrast and the life-giving spark of condiments. Or, as Mr. Turley and Mr. Calderon\n         \n          recently put it\n         \n         , \u201cDon\u2019t think of your sandwich as a\n         \n\n\n          Beyonc\u00e9\n         \n         , think of it as a Destiny\u2019s Child.\u201d The kitchen knows that even great roast beef, which the Meat Hook\u2019s is, needs backup. It needs a tangy, salty slice of Cheddar and horseradish sauce. Shredded lettuce for its juicy crispness and then, for a savory crackle, papery wheels of fried red onions. Finally, the bootylicious ingredient: a scattering of potato that seems to have been scraped off the bottom of a pan of hash browns.\n        \n\n         One sandwich is based on a hunch that roasted pork would benefit greatly from a creamy tuna sauce, vitello tonnato-style. (It does, and if the sauce is applied too lightly, the sandwich can be a little dry.)\n        \n\n         Another is a fairly straight-up Italian hero that, for once, starts with first-rate cold cuts (mortadella, pepperoni, soppressata, all from the Meat Hook), then hits them with caponata, raw onions, some unusually good pickled peppers and lardo whipped with roasted garlic. Would the flavors of the meats come through more clearly if they were folded and tucked to give them room to breathe, rather than being stacked up like plywood? Or is that a question that only a nonbutcher would ask?\n        \n\n         The Vegetarian Option is essentially a semolina roll heaped with all the garnishes from the other sandwiches. No meat intrudes on the fun, although the kitchen bends the rules slightly and slides in a purpose-made beet-parsnip-carrot hummus, without which the sandwich would probably taste like a heap of garnishes. In an expert piece of expectations-setting, Meat Hook Sandwich advertises that the Vegetarian Option is \u201cbetter than you\u2019d expect.\u201d This was absolutely correct; the sandwich is impressively complex and still satisfying.\n        \n\n         If I have to choose between that and the hot chicken sandwich, though,\n         \n\n\n          vegetarianism\n         \n         is going to get a quick shove into moving traffic. An ode to the\n         \n\n\n          Nashville\n         \n         specialty known for producing copious tears of pain and ecstatic, speechless reveries, the hot chicken at Meat Hook Sandwich is made from hot-sauce-brined thigh meat with the deep flavor of a barnyard bird. Fried chicken sandwiches are usually made with pallid cutlets, so the intensity is startling. On top of that, there is sweet pickled celery and dried-chile schmaltz. This is chicken that can bring your whole day to a dead stop for a few minutes.\n        \n\n         Next to the order counter is a small blackboard that is always worth scanning. This is where specials like the chopped cheese appear. Around St. Patrick\u2019s Day, there was tender corned beef on seeded pumpernickel with a devastatingly rich coating of Welsh rarebit sauce. Recently, I\u2019ve found a fine chipotle-fueled sloppy Joe.\n        \n\n         I wish I could tell you more about the steak and beer special, but when I tried to get it on the first day of this month, I was met instead by another rearranged cheeseburger. \u201cApril Fools,\u201d Mr. Young said. Two all-beef patties had been nacho-fied with Tex-Mex-style queso sauce, pickled jalape\u00f1os and crushed tortilla chips. If this is what butchers daydream about, I need a cleaver.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 159, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/15/dining/restaurant-review-meat-hook-sandwich-in-williamsburg-brooklyn.html", "google_mag": 26.5}, {"review_text": "\n            They prowl the city searching for nourishment and members of their own species. Often, they can be recognized by their feeding grounds. Birds of dignified plumage sit two by two in dim bistros and trattorias of upper Madison Avenue. Great beasts of prey stalk their gazelles at the teeming watering holes of the meatpacking district. Furtive, solitary woodland creatures, camouflaged in forest-floor colors, creep after dark into coffee shops all over the city.\n           \n\n            Then there are the shiny, slender creatures who stream up and down Manhattan in schools of four or more, usually grouped by sex, eyes darting to see who is swimming nearby. They like to feed on Italian food in crowded hotel restaurants, for reasons naturalists don\u2019t fully understand. This fall, they\u2019ve been fluttering their fins at\n            \n             Sessanta\n            \n            , inside the Sixty SoHo, and at\n            \n             L\u2019Amico\n            \n            , south of Herald Square on the ground floor of the Eventi.\n           \n\n            So successfully do these two restaurants attract this breed that they may have been built for that purpose alone. For other uses, they are not as reliable. Their cooking can be very rewarding at times, but not quite consistently enough to attract creatures who are mainly interested in food. Servers in both places can suddenly fade away; if you were dating, you\u2019d call it\n            \n             ghosting\n            \n            . These are restaurants for nights when company is the point, and if you manage to order a bottle of wine in less than 15 minutes and a few things on the table happen to be excellent, so much the better.\n           \n\n            Sessanta is the more stylish of the two. Martin Brudnizki Design Studio\u2019s dining room and lounge have a crisp midcentury-Italian confidence, with space left between the tables for added comfort and better sightlines. The aesthetic is polished and urbane, more negroni than Chianti.\n           \n\n            Jordan Frosolone, the chef, draws on the cooking of southern Italy, as a server explained one night by means of an unstoppable imaginary tour. (\u201cIn the north is Palermo. Going around to the east coast, we come to Catania. \u2026\u201d) Recognizably traditional dishes from that region seem more rare than when Sessanta opened in June, but Mr. Frosolone still brings out ingredients and flavors that you don\u2019t taste at many other Italian restaurants.\n           \n\n            The struncatura spaghetti, with its intense multigrain flavor and rough surfaces that catch the sauce of anchovies in a fermented-fish paste called neonata, could have come straight out of a Calabrian kitchen. Was the sandwich of caciocavallo and thin slices of tender beef tongue a less gnarly version of Sicily\u2019s spleen sandwich, or its own thing? Either way, it was a meaty thrill, like the roll-ups of scallions and lamb belly run through with a skewer and crisped on a griddle.\n           \n\n            The phase when you couldn\u2019t eat out in Manhattan without running into an ambitious pork chop seems to be over, but luckily nobody told Mr. Frosolone. He cooks a hulking mahogany beast of a chop, glazed with a sour, salty and sweet Marsala sauce.\n           \n\n            Then there are dishes with flaws you may not notice if you were, like the three men identically dressed in plaid shirts at the next booth, less interested in eating than in braying about your recent adventures, as if speaking to an audience across Canal Street.\n           \n\n            Tossed with a rag\u00f9 of dry, too-firm tuna were rings of anelloni, some chewily undercooked and a few almost completely uncooked at the seams where they had fused. Stringy octopus needed a longer braise, though I liked its bed of farro with dried apricots and the mild bite of fresh turmeric. An excellent hunk of swordfish, for some odd reason, was teamed on the same plate with nondescript strands of braised pork shoulder.\n           \n\n            And a pre-appetizer shot glass of apple-and-celery-root soup arrived lukewarm on a night when I probably wasn\u2019t spotted, though it was steamy on a night when I almost certainly was.\n           \n\n            The service changed significantly, too, though I wouldn\u2019t say having a server lean all the way across our long, high booth to refill our glasses each time we took a sip of water qualifies as an improvement. On other nights, I got used to being forgotten, waiting for dishes that seemed to arrive from the kitchen by way of Ho-Ho-Kus, or that never came at all.\n           \n\n\n\n            L\u2019Amico has two speeds, too. One evening, we waited by the door for almost a half-hour past our reservation time before getting a table. It was another 45 minutes before we had anything to eat; meanwhile, we had to hold the wine list in the air like a semaphore flag.\n           \n\n            Then, without warning, our cloak of invisibility dropped to the floor. Servers posted by the kitchen watched us as if we were about to steal the silverware. About 30 seconds after we got our main courses, somebody came over to ask, with an admirably straight face, \u201cNow that everybody has had a moment to enjoy their food, I trust that it is cooked to perfection?\u201d\n           \n\n            I wouldn\u2019t go that far, but the food at L\u2019Amico can be very satisfying. The owner and chef is Laurent Tourondel, once the leader of the fallen BLT empire; together with his chef de cuisine, Amy Eubanks, he works up casual Italian flavors that are not greatly innovative but occasionally glint with originality. Among pine nuts and cubes of roasted winter squash, supple, thin-rolled ravioli were stuffed with more squash, sweet and ultrasmooth. Pork sausage and bitter greens worked their way around loose corkscrews of fusilli, shiny with pork fat.\n           \n\n            Very tender meatballs of pork and veal were baked with red sauce that I happily swabbed up with a long, skinny paddle of toasted focaccia. Pizza with wilted crinkles of toasted kale over robiola and caramelized onions hid a cool surprise, the distinctive, forthright flavor of caraway seeds.\n           \n\n            L\u2019Amico\u2019s food can be flaccid and dull, too. Other pizzas at other meals, like the undersalted mushroom pie with truffle paste or the spicy soppressata over tomatoes, tasted flat until they had been squirted with Abruzzese chile oil. The heavy dose of iodine in bay scallops undermined otherwise fine seafood agnolotti. Skirt steak was mushy. Duck breast was overcooked under its limp, wet skin. A Bolognese with hard pebbles of veal lacked the savory intensity brought by a long simmer and patient caramelization.\n           \n\n            Few seem to mind. Between hanging light fixtures the size of kettle drums and a harlequin-tiled floor, the undraped wood tables have been jammed every time I\u2019ve gone. Once, I sat next to four young women who entertained themselves by reading out loud long strings of text messages and brag-complaining about the impossibility of their \u201cbrunch schedules.\u201d They jabbed this and that with forks, then slipped into Uber cars to resume their gliding circuits through New York\u2019s wild kingdom.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 160, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/dining/sessanta-lamico-review.html", "google_mag": 26.600000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n            When the chef Gabriel Kreuther left\n            \n             the Modern\n            \n            in 2014, he seems to have packed up virtually everything except Picasso\u2019s goat in the sculpture garden. He named\n            \n             the place he opened\n            \n            in June, across 42nd Street from Bryant Park, after himself, but it could just as easily be called the Modern in Exile.\n           \n\n            He took along the Modern\u2019s pastry chef, Marc Aumont, a virtuoso of desserts and breads who worked at his side for the restaurant\u2019s first nine years. He replicated its two-in-one structure, too. In the bar, where gooseneck streetlamps crane out over low tables, he has an approachable menu, some of it Alsatian, like rustic tartes flamb\u00e9es and the greatest liverwurst in the five boroughs. Things get far more elaborate once you enter the dining room, behind a ring of rough timber beams pulled from a Vermont barn.\n           \n\n            In that space, Mr. Kreuther imported the four-course $98 prix fixe format that was in place when I gave the Modern\u2019s dining room operation\n            \n             three stars\n            \n            in 2013. He has reproduced much of his last restaurant\u2019s tone, too, with formal but cheerful servers raising bell-shaped glass lids from main courses in synchrony and quickly running a silver sweeper over every crumb that falls on the white tablecloths.\n           \n\n            Mr. Kreuther did not make off with the Modern\u2019s wine cellar, but he charged Emilie Perrier with building a new one that is only slightly less impressive. There are treats from all over, but the excellent bottles from Alsace are a special pleasure.\n           \n\n            And of course, Mr. Kreuther brought his recipes.\n           \n\n            Here is the palm-size tart of smoked sturgeon and sauerkraut under a dandelion-colored mousseline with a gleaming black eye of caviar. There is the cushion of foie gras between two firm pieces of squab breast, trickling with red juices, all bundled up inside savoy cabbage and a papery shell of brik pastry. Both are as marvelous as I remembered. Like much of the cooking at this new restaurant, these dishes make an irresistible case for the power of classical European techniques, all the blade-flicking and stock-skimming tricks that Mr. Kreuther swings around so easily.\n           \n\n            A native of Alsace, his skills forged by the martial discipline of French, German and Swiss restaurants, Mr. Kreuther makes no effort to hide his old-school training.\n           \n\n            Rising up from a pool of cantaloupe sauce (an idea as cool as the chilled sauce itself) was a foie gras terrine. Any foie gras from Mr. Kreuther\u2019s kitchen is pretty much guaranteed to be wonderful; this one was molded into a dome studded all over with purplish cubes of duck prosciutto, each no bigger than a pinhead. A smaller brunoise may be technically possible, but it would require lasers.\n           \n\n            Fried frog meat in the lightest sheath of batter was bunched up at the end of a leg bone pared as clean as a toothpick; you dunk these drumsticks in a lemony garlic bouillon so bright and focused that you can almost see the worried face of the cook who watched the pot.\n           \n\n            Two things about this fine-grained precision.\n           \n\n            First, it is about as fashionable as acid-washed jeans. Younger chefs are scattering ashes over whole leaves, splashing buttermilk in a bowl and calling it a sauce, and trying to hide signs of human manipulation. Mr. Kreuther\u2019s dishes look as unmistakably man-made as a skyscraper, and his sauces were obviously produced in a stockpot, not an udder.\n           \n\n            Second, Mr. Kreuther uses technique with purpose. The point of cutting duck ham into microcubes is that you taste some with every bite of foie gras smashed on toasted brioche. So before dismissing this grand Midtown dining room as a horse-drawn carriage in the age of Uber, sit down and see how exciting a little knifework can be.\n           \n\n            Notionally, dinner is made up of four courses. In reality, new things stream out of the kitchen in an endless slot-machine cascade. Before the first course, three miniature dishes arrive at once. Each is a distinct event. The last time I camped out at a table, I wanted to pocket my guests\u2019 cracker-and-sweet-potato sandwiches.\n           \n\n            A new bread from Mr. Aumont\u2019s oven shows up every few minutes, each with its own spread. The parade starts with a warm, savory kugelhopf, still in its ceramic mold, with chive fromage blanc. It is so good that one of my guests nibbled on it while telling our server that she didn\u2019t eat gluten. A few minutes later, she was given a plate of the best gluten-free bread I\u2019ve ever met.\n           \n\n            I don\u2019t think Mr. Aumont can make a dessert I wouldn\u2019t like. He is always toying around with forms and shapes; the high point, so to speak, of his great chocolate-and-cherry dessert is a towering dark-chocolate cone that melts while you watch. But his games never interfere with the flavors, which stay clear and direct. Pineapple carpaccio is hidden under a tuile and a spoonful of herb sorbet (lime leaf, Thai basil), but you\u2019re never in doubt that the fruit is carrying the melody.\n           \n\n            The savory courses don\u2019t always have the same focus. Mr. Kreuther has a lot to say, but at times you wish he wouldn\u2019t say it all at once. A sweet, charred whole tomato was overcome by its seasonings, especially garlic and black pepper, and by the cup of dark gazpacho that tasted like an unspicy virgin Mary and didn\u2019t add any clarity.\n           \n\n            Far more distracting, though, is the crazily gaudy collection of tableware. Gabriel Kreuther would be a more elegant restaurant if the simple, well-designed service pieces from the Modern had come along for the trip.\n           \n\n            Servers place a different set of elongated forks and spoons on a black blotter before every course, and at moments balancing food on the end of one of these feels like a game from a small child\u2019s birthday party. Some courses arrive on crystal dishes with a spike on the bottom; you\u2019re told you can hold it by the spike or nest it into a kind of crystal inkwell, but what you can\u2019t do is eat the food without thinking about the thing it\u2019s sitting on. This pointless eccentricity goes on and on. Tableware salesmen must have scratched a symbol on the door that means \u201ceasy mark,\u201d like a hobo sign.\n           \n\n            At first the interior, designed by Glen Coben, also struck me as too frantic. Mr. Coben juxtaposes those barn pillars with copper panels, glazed tiles and wallcoverings boldly printed with storks and flowers. It\u2019s a little loony, but somehow all these elements together bring warmth and energy to a room that has at its core a deeply comfortable and rewarding white-tablecloth restaurant.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 161, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/23/dining/restaurant-review-gabriel-kreuther-in-midtown.html", "google_mag": 25.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n            We all know restaurants where the menu changes daily. Last week at\n            \n             Superiority Burger\n            \n            , a vegetarian medium-fast-food outfit in the East Village, it changed in the middle of my meal.\n           \n\n            I was eating a tofu wrap and a salad of tender red-veined chard with pickled onions and juice-heavy blackberries at one of the six seats. These have swing-down desktops that remind me of college lecture halls and the old Prime Burger that used to sit across 51st Street from St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral.\n           \n\n            You can occupy an individual burger desk in a popular restaurant for only so long before the urge to let somebody else sit down becomes overpowering. So when I got back in line to place a second order at the counter, I asked for takeout.\n           \n\n            The chard salad, served like most of the vegetables in a paper boat, was no more. Taped to the spot on the white-tiled wall where its name had been written on a white card in black marker was something new: juicy green heirloom tomatoes with chopped corn. I wondered if one of the cooks had just tried out a new dish on\n            \n             Brooks Headley\n            \n            , the chef and owner, and he\u2019d said, at 7:30 in the evening, \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d\n           \n\n            That was not far off, it turned out. \u201cWe\u2019ve come up with a lot of our specials during little lulls in service,\u201d Mr. Headley, who was the pastry chef at\n            \n             Del Posto\n            \n            until he opened Superiority Burger in June,\n            \n             told Lucky Peach\n            \n            recently. \u201cEverybody runs down to the basement and picks up a project.\u201d\n           \n\n            New ideas fly through the kitchen so quickly, you can almost hear them buzz by. This is what elevates Superiority Burger above what it appears to be at first glance, a\n            \n             Shake Shack\n            \n            for vegetarians. And it\u2019s why going back regularly, as I\u2019ve been doing, is an adventure. The avid experimentations of Mr. Headley and his cooks remind me of what was going on in the first year at\n            \n             Momofuku Noodle Bar\n            \n            , when David Chang and Joaquin Baca were on the edge of giving up and came back by cooking as if it were their last chance.\n           \n\n            Nothing at Superiority Burger contains meat, and most dishes can be made without animal products on request. Some of them you can be sure of finding every time, including the\n            \n             veggie burger\n            \n            that was famous from pop-ups before the restaurant opened. Others arrive out of nowhere and disappear a day or a week later.\n           \n\n            When it is among the specials taped to the wall, a meatless analogue of the Philadelphia cheesesteak interests me keenly. Shaved steak had been traded in for strips of yuba, the immortal Cheez Whiz for a smooth, subtly flavorful species of cashew cheese. The yuba mostly worked as texture; the flavor, which was strong and lasting, burst out of a spicy swirl of soft, deeply browned onions and green peppers. That sandwich did not mimic the flavor of a cheesesteak but conjured up enough of the sensations touched off by a cheesesteak to be an honest variation, not a fake. It was both heartfelt homage and its own, craveable thing.\n           \n\n            It wasn\u2019t on the wall last time; I look forward to our reunion one day. The same goes for the ice-cold smashed cucumbers that seemed to have collided, in one of those fortuitous you-got-chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter accidents, with what tasted like spicy rice pudding.\n           \n\n            (Personal and confidential to the roasted fingerlings and eggplant last seen wearing capers and pine nuts in a radiant lemon vinaigrette: Please come back. I won\u2019t ask where you\u2019ve been if you don\u2019t ask me about the chard salad.)\n           \n\n            When it comes to Mr. Headley\u2019s gelati and sorbets, I try to adopt a Buddha-like state of nonattachment. These appear in a different two-scoop duet each night, one sorbet of ripe fruit straight from the market sharing a small paper cup with a dairy-based gelato. Last time, it was peach sorbet under gelato made with toasted hamburger buns; there were roasted peaches between them and a powder of the toasted buns, soaked in milk and dried, dusted over the top. When my Zen intentions weaken and I find myself wanting it again, I meditate on the impermanence of life as represented by a seductively lush nectarine sorbet I tasted a month ago.\n           \n\n            Wearing the paper cap of an old-time burger flipper or soda jerk, Mr. Headley takes care to serve his ice creams just cold enough to slide when they touch your tongue. But they won\u2019t be melting; if you have ordered it with dinner and sat down at one of the burger desks, he\u2019ll wait until you\u2019ve finished before he picks up the scoop. I can\u2019t think of a better, more meticulously put-together $4 dessert in the city.\n           \n\n            To my taste, it outshines the sandwich for which the place is named. The Superiority Burger is indeed superior to many other veggie burgers, but truly loving it may require a built-in desire for veggie burgers that I lack. Filling out its small Martin\u2019s potato bun, layered with melted Muenster, iceberg lettuce, roasted plum tomatoes, brown honey mustard and pickles, the patty is seared to an energetic crackle and has a satisfyingly tender bulk. The buildup is almost too convincing, because the patty itself, which tastes of mashed beans, nuts and grains, breaks the illusion. For a ground-beef fan, the Superiority Burger takes you almost all the way, then stops.\n           \n\n            Among the sandwiches on the permanent roster, I prefer the Sloppy Dave. This is, of course, a meatless sloppy Joe, a sesame-seed roll filled with tofu in a marvelously spicy tomato sauce, with fried onions on top. I should say \u201cusually filled with tofu\u201d; the sandwich was almost all sauce on a first encounter, but it had more substance on subsequent tries.\n           \n\n            The menu\u2019s nicest surprise is the Superiority Wrap, a whole-wheat tortilla encasing tofu and brown rice. A similar item is a staple of earnest vegetarian restaurants, where it typically tastes like a paper-towel tube packed with pulverized drywall moistened with Morrissey\u2019s tears. The Superiority Wrap is a much more rewarding proposition. The rice has an excellent nutty taste. Shredded cabbage has a refreshing effect. A streak of bright tahini whirred with roasted sweet and hot peppers cuts through the tofu like a searchlight. And I loved the playful sweetness provided by a vein of candied sunflower seeds.\n           \n\n            The aesthetics of Superiority Burger are\n            \n             half-White Castle\n            \n            , half-punk. The menu board and signs borrow the stencils and ransom-note lettering from rock\u2019s safety-pin-and-spit era. Music swerves from Wire and the Clash to proto-punks like the y\u00e9-y\u00e9 singer Karina. The prices, which peak at $9 for the wrap, are as democratic as it gets.\n           \n\n            Mr. Headley, a hard-core-band drummer, leads his restaurant with the collaborative spirit of a musical style that gave up peacock guitar solos for blitzkrieg-bopping ensemble playing. He\u2019ll tell anybody who asks that the cucumber salad isn\u2019t his, but the work of a sous-chef, Julia Goldberg, and his menu is loaded with shout-outs to other chefs and restaurants. The chard salad had \u201cZuni pickled onions,\u201d and raspberry sorbet came with \u201cCF cream cheese gelato.\u201d\n           \n\n            \u201cDoes CF stand for cruelty free?\u201d a customer asked.\n           \n\n            \u201cNo, Claudia Fleming.\u201d\n           \n\n            Another name you may hear, if you go more than once, is your own. The woman at the counter surprised me one night by remembering not just my fake name but the real one of the last person I had brought. This was more than standard critic-spotting. She showed me a stack of yellow Post-it notes with the names of repeat customers.\n           \n\n            \u201cI\u2019m trying to learn them all,\u201d she said.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 162, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/dining/restaurant-review-superiority-burger-in-the-east-village.html", "google_mag": 31.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n            If you lived in New York in 2008, taking in an adequate supply of oxygen and any quantity of food media at all, you knew two things about a new restaurant called\n            \n             Momofuku Ko\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            One was that its owner, chef and chief iconoclast, David Chang, had imposed a reservations website that frustrated everybody except coders who wrote programs to snatch up some of the 12 seats the instant they went online. (Among the frustrated was my predecessor Frank Bruni, who, in order to write his three-star review,\n            \n             \u201centered into groveling, Ko-dependent arrangements with tireless friends and readers.\u201d\n            \n            )\n           \n\n            You also knew that Ko served foie gras in a way the city had never seen. A cook behind the counter would rub a frozen cured brick of it across a Microplane held above a bowl with pine nut brittle, riesling jelly and lobes of lychee, showering them with falling pink flakes of airborne pleasure.\n           \n\n            Mr. Chang moved Ko to an alleyway off East First Street late last year, and it\u2019s a testament to how much more polished and accomplished the new place is that when the foie gras appears toward the end of the night, it doesn\u2019t dazzle the way it used to. In the company of another 14 or so graceful, beautiful dishes, it is slightly flat-footed, a dancer loping across the stage in Chuck Taylors while the rest of the corps balances on pointe shoes.\n           \n\n            This is no put-down. There\u2019s no shame in being outclassed by a firm, spiced tartare of Japanese sea bream hanging in a sparkling jelly brewed from the fish\u2019s bones in which capsules of finger lime wait, invisibly, tiny balloons of sourness ready to pop.\n           \n\n            Or in being cast in the shade by a one-bite mille-feuille whose crisp layers of rye pastry, sprinkled with green tea powder, hold lush yuzukosho b\u00e9chamel and briny little globes of trout roe.\n           \n\n            Or in being shown up by barely seared, gently smoked lobster tail with the juicy tenderness of a ripe, warm nectarine. Extraordinary on its own, the tail sits on a whorl of spaghetti squash that becomes uncharacteristically exciting as it drinks up a foamy lobster sauce. At last, we know what spaghetti squash is good for.\n           \n\n            Leading the gang of cooks responsible for these plates and others is Sean Gray, Ko\u2019s executive chef since 2014. (Mr. Chang, often seen wedged behind the counter in 2008, now presumably lurks in an underground lair somewhere, staring at a wall map with pins marking his dominion in New York, Toronto and Sydney.)\n           \n\n            Momofuku Ko is remembered as a local pioneer of the tasting-counter format that has spread across the country, but the original ambition was bolder. Mr. Chang was leading a daring experiment that asked: If you aspired to serve food as original and refined as anything in an expensive uptown restaurant but wanted to keep prices down, exactly how many amenities could you strip out? The answer turned out to be, \u201cNot quite\n            \n             that\n            \n            many, Dave,\u201d but the question was the right one at the right time.\n           \n\n            With the move, that experiment officially ended. The new Ko has amenities galore and a price to match.\n           \n\n            The high degree of finesse in the $175 tasting menus must be due in part to the greater acreage and better equipment in the kitchen, inside a U-shaped counter that seats up to 18. As they did before the move, Mr. Gray and his colleagues take turns delivering dishes. The original crew on First Avenue rarely made eye contact and often appeared mildly resentful, an understandable reaction in those sweatshop conditions. Now, Mr. Gray and his collaborators look relaxed. Sometimes they even smile.\n           \n\n            They\u2019re not the only ones whose accommodations have been upgraded. We diners can settle our tense, crooked frames into the pliant leather seats and backs of the tall stools arranged around the counter, enjoying space around and behind us. This may not sound like cause to celebrate unless you remember the old Ko, where every time somebody squeezed behind you on the way to the restroom, you had to lean forward and hold your breath.\n           \n\n            Should you arrive early to this palace of luxury, you can pause at the small and very appealing bar, where the cocktails are highly intelligent without rubbing your nose in it. After the desserts (if you are in luck, one will be a bittersweet cookie-like tart shell filled with Fernet Branca pastry cream and dark chocolate mousse), you can ask for a cup of hearty and well-rounded barley tea, a remarkable concession from Mr. Chang, who in the past seemed to regard tea as a sign of weakness.\n           \n\n            During the meal, there is wine, in uncannily delicate glasses, from some of the world\u2019s most revered grape stompers. Jordan Salcito, beverage director for the Momofuku group, gives these winemakers\u2019 names and faces prominent play on her 78-page list. She also tries to show stylistic resemblances by noting when one producer has influenced another. This is a more useful, up-to-date way to choose a bottle than the ancient system of memorizing vintages and appellations. It comes at the cost, though, of emphasizing cult stars over new finds whose bottles are often bargains; there could be more choices for under $75.\n           \n\n            Versatile wines do best with the quick shifts of flavor in the seafood-heavy menu. You don\u2019t want anything to fight with the intense flavor of cured, citrus-glazed mackerel sushi under scallions and grated fresh ginger strands. The skin is quickly blistered with the same blowtorch used to gently toast the bottom of the rice, bringing a wonderfully un-sushi-like crunch to one of the restaurant\u2019s most delicious creations.\n           \n\n            Dud dishes are rare. There must be better places for exceptionally soft Osetra caviar than in a tomato-and-basil salad, for instance. (There are, and on another night the roe was spooned over an amazing, near-liquid potato pur\u00e9e.)\n           \n\n            Soy milk chawanmushi and a dark blotch of intentionally burned applesauce would have been puzzling with sea urchin even if the urchin hadn\u2019t tasted metallic and iodine-heavy. This was more surprising because I\u2019d been served exceptional sea urchin on other nights, laid alongside a swoosh of chickpea pur\u00e9e that incorporates fermented chickpea paste. If I told you fermented chickpea paste tastes a little like cheese, you might not want to try it, but you should. Eaten together with the urchin, two soft and orange blobs finding each other inside your mouth, it\u2019s like a door cracking open to a new world of flavor.\n           \n\n            A few failures don\u2019t necessarily derail a meal that aims this high. But you might, if you were feeling philosophical, point out that the menu\u2019s sensibility could be more unified. Mr. Chang once called tasting menus \u201cchefs\u2019 novels, their big ideas, their statements of purpose and intent.\u201d The menus at the new Ko are more like collections of short stories, not all by the same author.\n           \n\n            Quills of trofie dressed with Tasso ham, poblano peppers and Mimolette cheese make an odd traveling companion for the mackerel sushi. Elysian Farms lamb with green tomatoes and Calabrian chiles might turn up in any number of restaurants, and so could the excellent sourdough bread. Nobody would say that about the daring chickpea and sea urchin duet.\n           \n\n            The unifying theme of the original Ko was: \u201cForget your ideas of fancy dining. Here\u2019s something new.\u201d It was built by and for young, hungry, probably insomniac rebels who chased their craziest ideas. The new Ko was built by a mature chef for customers who have grown up, and it reflects all the comforts and resources and security and extra padding we accumulate in the middle of our lives. Those things can hem us in, putting the 4 a.m. howlings of youth out of reach, or at least making them seem counterproductive. If the new Ko has a message, it is: \u201cYep. This is what fancy dining is like now.\u201d But those youthful howlings are still in its bones.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 164, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/dining/restaurant-review-momofuku-ko-east-village.html", "google_mag": 28.899999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n            It took three dinners at\n            \n             Mimi\n            \n            before I saw the restaurant that had other people so excited.\n           \n\n            Mimi barely ruffled the waters of the crowded pond of New York dining when it materialized on a quiet Greenwich Village block last fall. The partners had never owned a restaurant before. The chef, Liz Johnson, was 25 years old. Although she had been cooking for a decade, it was hard to draw a bead on\n            \n             her busy work history\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            The critics waddled in gradually, giving the people at Mimi the rare luxury of time to find their rhythm. Each was more enthusiastic than the last, culminating with Brett Martin of GQ, who in May put Mimi on\n            \n             his list\n            \n            of the country\u2019s best new restaurants.\n           \n\n            Mimi looks like an updated version of the French bistro New Yorkers dream of finding in the Village. In the front is a little parenthesis of a bar that ends at a sheet of white marble with dark Rorschach veins. The bar\u2019s surface is stainless steel, not zinc, but you still get the idea. The tables are small and lined up one after the other, which brings you close to the people you\u2019re eating with and to people you weren\u2019t planning to eat with. So what. There are classical little cocktails and bluesy cocktail jazz to go with them, just what you want to hear at a fantasy bistro.\n           \n\n            The Mimi I encountered in early spring, though, seemed unprepared for national attention. Ours was the first table seated that night, and already the kitchen was out of the monkfish liver. This was unexpected, because it had been written on the menu by hand below that day\u2019s date. After we ordered, our server came back to say that the lobster we\u2019d wanted was gone, too.\n           \n\n            We still ate well. Ms. Johnson took marvelous ingredients and led them toward luxuriousness with a little imagination and a prodigal use of butter.\n           \n\n            To start, we shared firm pieces of raw madai in brown butter with lemon curd. Snails in a crater of puff pastry tasted clean and meaty, and the unannounced sweetbreads were a welcome surprise. There was also a long, rich, generous slab of tuna belly paved with a dark-green mash of shishito peppers \u2014 an odd idea and a good one.\n           \n\n            Other dishes could have used more precision. Five excellent, sweet scallops sat on creamy blots of bottarga sauce over black rice that had been swirled with more butter than it needed or could hold; the butter pooled on the plate. At dessert, the keen taste of rhubarb couldn\u2019t quite break free from an over-thickened rhubarb gel on a blancmange.\n           \n\n            Over the next two months, while good reviews rolled in, I waited for Mimi to come into focus. It was even more blurry the next time I went.\n           \n\n            About half the meal was delicious in ways I rarely experience in other restaurants. Very gently crisped eel and fleshy yellow peaches went with a strong mustard sauce that sent fumes up the back of my nose, and the combination made neural pathways begin firing that had never seen action before. Less daring, more elemental, was lamb cooked until the fat melted into the soft pink flesh. The sauce was a rough pesto of nettles, nothing fussy about it, with a creamy brick of pommes dauphinois.\n           \n\n            But the rest was seriously undercooked. Most of the bottom crust on a rhubarb tarte Tatin was pale and doughy. Parts of a grilled turbot were still translucent. When the souffl\u00e9 for two was pierced with a spoon, batter oozed out the top. In each case, a quick look in the kitchen (or at the table, in the case of the souffl\u00e9, which cost $22) would have been enough to tell that more time on the heat was needed.\n           \n\n            It was as if Ms. Johnson had two kitchens, one in which superb ingredients lined up and did exactly what she told them to do and another in which the clocks were broken.\n           \n\n            The last time I went to Mimi, all the food came out of the same kitchen: the good one. True, and as usual, some items had already been eighty-sixed before the sun went down. Mimi may be the first restaurant in which servers greet tables not with \u201cDo you know what you\u2019d like?\u201d but \u201cDo you know what we\u2019re out of?\u201d\n           \n\n            But I\u2019d arrived early, so I got what I wanted. I finally tried the two desserts everybody loves. One is a very dark and fluffy chocolate tart, so pleasurable it must have been a reward for some good deed I\u2019d done by mistake. The other is a baba au rhum that is more lavishly creamy than most. It\u2019s also less boozy, though that can be treated by the bottle of Venezuelan rum the server leaves behind.\n           \n\n            At the start of dinner there were crisp spring peas in a creamy and stealthily spicy sauce. Above this were three raw spot prawns, as good as I\u2019ve had in any sushi bar. Their heads had been fried and lined up on a plate like helmets at a biker bar. This was one of the stranger meetings of French and Japanese cuisines I\u2019ve tasted, and I liked it very much.\n           \n\n            A hunk of foie gras had been saut\u00e9ed with peaches, and then the contents of the pan had been more or less dumped onto a plate. Many chefs swaddle and spoil foie gras as if it were a high-strung show dog. Ms. Johnson seems to understand that it performs better when it\u2019s allowed to roll around and get messy.\n           \n\n            Which is essentially what two guests and I did when an entire Dungeness crab was plunked down in front of us. It looked like the centerpiece of a Chinese banquet. The legs, bright red and wet with snail butter, radiated around the body, which had been excavated and backfilled with crab meat that had been enriched into a form not too far off from lobster thermidor.\n           \n\n            We ate a lot of crab. We ate a lot of butter. Finger bowls appeared, and we rinsed our hands in them again and again.\n           \n\n            Ms. Johnson may still be figuring how much food to order. She probably needs somebody to tell her when a plate doesn\u2019t look right. But she\u2019s got something any number of more experienced chefs don\u2019t: a clear and personal vision of French food as a celebration of appetite, an occasion to eat with joy and lust.\n           \n\n            Turn left at the bottom of a staircase to the basement and you come to the kitchen. Turn right and you find the restrooms.\n           \n\n            The walls are painted with wavy red curves. The curves form hips and arms and breasts. There\u2019s a framed drawing of an undressed woman with a Louise Brooks bob who lies on her belly, toes pointing at the ceiling. Smoke from her cigarette curls toward the words NO SMOKING. Never has a sign undermined its own message more attractively.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 166, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/13/dining/mimi-restaurant-review.html", "google_mag": 29.700000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n            Almost everyone who has lived in Manhattan has had the dream. Wandering through your apartment, you see a door nobody has noticed before. On the other side, you find that you have been living all along with extra rooms: enough space for an office, a guest bedroom, a painting studio, a walk-in closet, a tiki bar, a library.\n           \n\n            That sensation is what you get walking into\n            \n             Agern\n            \n            for the first time. Just off a corridor in Grand Central Terminal that you\u2019ve probably rushed down hundreds of times, behind a set of doors locked for longer than most New Yorkers can remember, a restaurant has appeared. In the three months since it opened, Agern has made both the train station and the city\u2019s dining landscape into roomier, more interesting places.\n           \n\n            There are no windows, and the front entrance, at the top of a short flight of stairs, is marked by a small sign that\u2019s easy to walk past. This makes Agern (AY-gurn) feel like a quiet harbor away from the eddies and currents of commuters outside. Hours can slip away. In the modern Scandinavian dining room, pale wood, charcoal seat cushions and wall tiles in mossy Grand Central green create a calming mood. It\u2019s like a spa with tasting menus and cocktails.\n           \n\n            The primary owner is the Danish restaurateur Claus Meyer, one of the founders of\n            \n             Noma\n            \n            , in Copenhagen, and of its\n            \n             New Nordic cooking style\n            \n            . New Nordic is not so much a cuisine as a philosophy. Its followers value traditional methods like curing and smoking, and seek out forgotten or overlooked ingredients from nearby.\n           \n\n            Mr. Meyer recruited Gunnar Gislason, the chef of the New Nordic restaurant Dill, in Reykjavik, Iceland, to run the kitchen. Mr. Gislason has imported Dill\u2019s philosophy but not, for the most part, its Icelandic provisions, like the dried sheep droppings over which fish is smoked. Buying food raised around New York, he and his chef de cuisine, Joseph Yardley, treat the city as another Scandinavian capital: Oslo-on-Hudson.\n           \n\n            Sign on for the Field and Forest menu, a vegetarian excursion through seven courses with a salvo of finger foods (the $120 price, like all the prices at Agern, includes service), and the plants you eat are mostly those you could buy at\n            \n             Union Square Greenmarket\n            \n            . What the kitchen does to them gives them an unfamiliar and often transporting cast.\n           \n\n            There was, for instance, a potato salad that caused double and triple takes. The potatoes had a restrained but durable smokiness. They were served with shaved rhubarb, ramps and feathery red seaweed, which carried a memory of the ocean. Finally, long yellow bands of cured egg yolk had the salty, intensifying effect of bottarga.\n           \n\n            That salad has been replaced by one with lemon cucumbers and fleshy summer melon, but the cured egg remains, giving the fruit and vegetables a depth I didn\u2019t expect.\n           \n\n            Preserved blackberries, tart and a little salty, brought a welcome sharpness to endive salad, dressed with mild and creamy havgus cheese and chopped almonds. Sweet corn and fresh chanterelles are a classic summer match, but I had no idea how wonderful they could taste with the addition of tarragon and golden raspberries.\n           \n\n            The Land and Sea menu costs $25 more. In the New Nordic spirit, the animal flesh is not supplied by overworked and unsustainable ingredients. It comes from more humble stuff.\n           \n\n            Rather than foie gras, there is beef heart, chopped into red filaments that provide ballast and iron to a salad of skinny asparagus stems and garlic scapes with tart green slices of unripe strawberries.\n           \n\n            Instead of bluefin tuna, you eat skate, cooked gingerly to keep the appealing gelatinous softness, under celery and batons of apple. Heirloom pork is not the loin but the neck, imbued (too strongly?) with rosemary and served with a crisp, simple, creamy and very good salad of green beans.\n           \n\n            The two menus are not that far apart. Sometimes they are separated by a single ingredient: A few briny spoonfuls of trout eggs get the potato salad admitted to the Land and Sea menu. From time to time, they converge on an identical dish like the unaccountably delicious potato fry bread, a fritter of sourdough mixed with mashed potatoes, or the roasted beet.\n           \n\n            The last time I ate at Agern, this had become \u201c\n            \n             our famous beet\n            \n            .\u201d It does seem to have been consciously designed to be talked about. It\u2019s carved on a cart next to the table after being liberated from the salt-and-ash crust it\u2019s baked in. The crust is supposed to give the beet the flavor it would pick up over a wood fire, but it didn\u2019t taste smoky to me.\n           \n\n            My first bite was impossibly salty, too. But after that, its natural flavors were deeply concentrated, and the underlying beet salad, flecked with fresh horseradish and fried caraway seeds, was stunning on its own. So was the tiny loaf of sunflower-seed rye bread, wonderful with beets mashed into it and even more wonderful under a thick coat of butter. These thumb-size loaves are baked by Rhonda Crosson, and I think they are at least as good as her big rounds of sourdough, and those are exceptional.\n           \n\n            Agern\u2019s pastry chef, Rebecca Eichenbaum, showed how resourceful she could be in her last job, at\n            \n             Wassail\n            \n            , where she spun elaborate desserts out of parsnips and carrots. She is no less inventive at Agern, but the results are a little less effortful, even as she tops ripe berries with a kombucha ice made from rose petals or doubles up on the tartness of sorrel sherbet with curls of barely sweetened rhubarb.\n           \n\n            Many of these can be ordered individually, a considerate option from a restaurant where on the wrong night the tasting menus can inch forward like the rush-hour local to New Haven. My last meal lasted more than four hours, for no discernible reason. There may be travelers, or even nontravelers, who would be happy with two courses and dessert. I\u2019d suggest, though, that they stay away from the $68 \u201c24-day hung beef\u201d; whatever flavor it picked up from hanging was stamped out by horseradish cream and horseradish leaves.\n           \n\n            In Denmark, Mr. Meyer is also active in delis, bakeries, a coffee roaster and other concerns. Last year, he moved to New York, and he is adapting to his new home with the same entrepreneurial energy. In Brooklyn, he has opened a bakery and a coffee roaster under the direction of a star of the Copenhagen caffeine scene named Omar Maagaard.\n           \n\n            Mr. Maagaard\u2019s beans are brewed into Agern\u2019s espresso and pour-overs, which made me think for the first time that the people who compare coffee to great wine are not completely barking mad. And I say this having lived through five excruciating minutes during which coffee was brewed drop by drop atop a digital scale. (For tableside drama, digital scales run a distant third to sharp knives and open flames.)\n           \n\n            Following the buy-local spirit, most of the other drinks are grown in the United States. Chad Walsh has put together a list of domestic wines, beers, spirits, cider and mead. (Strange things are happening in mead, a beverage that is pretty strange to begin with.)\n           \n\n            As you leave, you\u2019re handed a cloth sack or two. Inside you may find a small sourdough loaf with a jar of butter or bright, freshly cooked raspberry jam. Or a bottle of cold-brewed coffee. They could be advertisements for Mr. Meyer\u2019s tentacular operations, I suppose, but ads rarely taste so good the next day.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 167, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/03/dining/agern-restaurant-review.html", "google_mag": 32.79999923706055}, {"review_text": "\n\n             Olmsted\n            \n            , a two-month-old restaurant in Brooklyn, looks innocent enough. Not much in the dining room sets it apart from any number of other new places to eat. The houseplants whose vines slink down one wall may well come from Lowe\u2019s.\n           \n\n            Toward the back is a cooking space big enough for two people; I believe the term in the trade is \u201ca two-butt kitchen.\u201d The chef, Greg Baxtrom, works on the outside of the pass, putting the last touches on dishes that cost no more than $24.\n           \n\n            But hidden inside this simple and approachable neighborhood restaurant is another, more unusual one waiting to get out. Your first clue comes when you head out to the garden before dinner for a drink and encounter the livestock.\n           \n\n            At the bottom of an enamel claw-foot bathtub by the rear door, crayfish scuttle for cover as you get close. At the far end of a long, raised bed of radishes, against the back fence, is a bird coop. Living inside are one mottled quail and an all-white one, an experimental breed, no doubt the first of its kind to settle in Prospect Heights.\n           \n\n            This is not normal neighborhood-restaurant behavior. I\u2019ve tried to garden in a Brooklyn backyard, and I\u2019ve tried to raise crayfish. Each effort was done in by unforeseen complications. (Shade, cannibalism.)\n           \n\n            Olmsted is more serious about its backyard farming than I was. Mr. Baxtrom\u2019s chief partner in the restaurant is Ian Rothman, the founder of a 10-acre farm in Massachusetts and the former horticulturist at\n            \n             Atera\n            \n            in TriBeCa, where he grew kale and other greenery\n            \n             in hydroponic beds under lights in the basement\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            His urban farm behind Olmsted is a trickier project, and it includes a composter in which vegetable scraps are broken down by the larvae of black soldier flies that, after they mature, are fed to the crayfish.\n           \n\n            The peppery leaves of those radishes go into Olmsted\u2019s gazpacho. Thickened a bit with potatoes, it comes across less as a gazpacho than a green vichyssoise. Poured into a bowl holding trout roe, gently pickled radish wedges and a mound of lemon balm foam, it is inarguably delicious.\n           \n\n            This recipe did not come out of the Brooklyn farm-to-table playbook. That\u2019s true of most of the dishes Mr. Baxtrom has devised. For a cocktail snack, he\u2019s come up with riceless nigiri \u2014 a strip of raw fluke, underscored with an aggressive stripe of Calabrian chiles and set on a bed of watermelon. Earlier, the fish sat on a snap-pea pod, cut lengthwise into a little canoe. It\u2019s very good both ways, even if the watermelon sushi is a little drippy for finger food.\n           \n\n            The carrot crepe is a strange and fascinating appetizer. Arranged under or over the big orange circle of the crepe are buttered littleneck clams, carrots in several forms and a cluster of sunflower seeds. I didn\u2019t warm up to the whole ensemble right away, but it got into my head and now I want it again.\n           \n\n            Sweet-pea falafel, a main course, takes no getting used to. Some assembly is required, though. Into the fluffy purse of a pea-flour pita (or peata, as the menu has it) you pack some wonderfully light balls of pea falafel and dress them with pur\u00e9ed and whole peas, a salad of cucumbers and currants, and labne mixed with cardamom and fresh mint. You taste peas, lots of them, but you also taste summer.\n           \n\n            Before he opened Olmsted, Mr. Baxtrom cooked at Alinea, Per Se, Blue Hill at Stone Barns and Atera, where he met Mr. Rothman. You can see the influence of those kitchens in the way he treats falafel as a showcase for vegetables and carrots as a backdrop for clams.\n           \n\n            At least as impressive is one thing that Mr. Baxtrom didn\u2019t take from those restaurants. He hasn\u2019t locked up his thoughtful and original food inside an hourslong tasting menu.\n           \n\n            Individually, tour-de-force meals at the sort of restaurant where Mr. Baxtrom trained can be exhilarating. Collectively, what they represent is hard to cheer: the birth of a new restaurant elite that is even more exclusive than the old guard. What is particularly depressing is how many talented chefs now use what they know about ingredients, visual composition and other areas of expertise to devise menus that justify prices only a small number of people can afford. It\u2019s similar to the way our best-known architects, rather than trying to make our homes and workplaces better, use their knowledge to build dazzling trophies.\n           \n\n            Even Olmsted\u2019s least expensive main course, of course, is beyond the reach of many people in its neighborhood. But that doesn\u2019t make it less impressive to see Mr. Baxtrom keeping prices low relative to other restaurants with Olmsted\u2019s level of inventiveness.\n           \n\n            He cooks fish that are plentiful and, not coincidentally, cheaper. I missed dogfish\u2019s run on the menu, but the other week I very much enjoyed the seared pollock he served with a tart cherry sauce and a panzanella made with juicy cherries and cherry tomatoes. (When I tried an earlier iteration using hake and rhubarb, the texture of the fish wasn\u2019t as fine and the rhubarb sauce was a little sweet.)\n           \n\n            Torn scallops, bought at a discount, are threaded on skewers and charcoal grilled. They are as good and fresh as if they were whole, and I love how the pasilla chile in their dry rub nips at the sweetness of the creamed corn they rest on.\n           \n\n            There is no $100 roast chicken but there is guinea hen two ways for $24. The breast meat is shot through with a fat green vein of ramp mousse; even more appealing is the second installment, a braised confit of the legs under morels and a lush ramp hollandaise. (If you\u2019re there when the hen\u2019s liver has been made into a honey-topped terrine, order it.)\n           \n\n            When you don\u2019t like something, it never seems like a good value, and that\u2019s how I felt about a \u201cThai beet salad\u201d that had too many crunchy ribbons of raw beet and not enough of whatever was supposed to make it Thai. It\u2019s off the menu now.\n           \n\n            The kitchen backs off on the complications with dessert. Both the bowl of frozen yogurt, sweetened with whipped lavender honey, and the chocolate mousse, made by somebody who understands chocolate mousse, are simple and effective.\n           \n\n            The wine list was put together by Jeff Ruiz. He is another veteran of Atera, where a wine pairing with the tasting menu costs $195. At Olmsted, two-thirds of the bottles cost less than $60. A handful are under $40, a price range restaurants that pay attention to wine rarely bother with anymore.\n           \n\n            Olmsted is no competition to Atera and the other elite restaurants like it. But it is, in some ways, a challenge to those places, or at least to their notion that the best stage for a chef\u2019s talent is the most expensive one.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 168, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/dining/olmsted-restaurant-review.html", "google_mag": 25.399999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n\n             Editors\u2019 Note: The Times has published starred reviews of restaurants in the New York metropolitan area since 1963. Starting today, we will occasionally offer such reviews of restaurants in other cities as well, applying the same standards that govern our reviews in New York: a minimum of three anonymous visits to the restaurant.\n            \n\n\n            SANTA MONICA, Calif. \u2014 On my table at\n            \n             Cassia\n            \n            was a thick, black, gnarled pig tail. The menu said it was grilled, but I was ready to believe it had been incinerated in a rage, as if I had mortally insulted the chef and serving me this stick of carbon were his revenge. But the nice woman waiting on me didn\u2019t seem to think anything was wrong. She seemed excited for me. Would I like her to cut it up, she asked?\n           \n\n            \u201cUm,\u201d I began. Before I finished, she slid a knife\u2019s point down the length of the tail.\n           \n\n            \u201cI want to make sure you really get all the meat,\u201d she said, lifting out links of bone. \u201cSometimes I see people serving themselves, and they don\u2019t get into it the right way.\u201d\n           \n\n            She got into it, all right, leaving me with a heap of meat, soft fat and skin. It was not nearly as annihilated as it looked at first glance. I rolled a forkful or two into a curl of Bibb lettuce with some Thai basil, cilantro and laksa leaf, and dipped it into nuoc cham. The antiphony of char and fat, cool leaves and warm grease, fish sauce and green herbs is in the end a simple thing. Or it would be simple if Vietnamese stalls across the United States sold grilled pig tails.\n           \n\n            One of the most appealing things about Cassia, a year-old restaurant here, is its pointed lack of interest in being confrontational, as my meeting with the pig tail illustrates. The restaurant goes out of its way to be accommodating, without doing too much violence to the various Asian cuisines that inspire much of the menu.\n           \n\n            Bryant Ng, the chef, isn\u2019t in the business of scrawling his signature on other countries\u2019 cultures. He doesn\u2019t max out the fat and the funk, the standard tactic now for American cooks who want to let it be known that they are down with Asian cuisines. He\u2019s more focused on balance than extremes.\n           \n\n            Mr. Ng owns Cassia with his wife, Kim Ng, and another couple, Josh Loeb and Zoe Nathan, who among other places run an impressive wine bar nearby called\n            \n             Rustic Canyon\n            \n            . The idea of Cassia was to flesh out the ideas Mr. Ng developed at his last restaurant,\n            \n             the Spice Table\n            \n            , within the framework of a busy, well-oiled brasserie. A whiff of blazing wood drifts across the menu and around the restaurant, which would look like an aircraft hangar if it weren\u2019t broken up by an open grill, an oyster-shucking counter and a bar where seats have a view of Seventh Street beyond a mountain range of liquor bottles.\n           \n\n            As if you were at\n            \n             La Coupole\n            \n            , you could start with a shellfish platter, although here you\u2019d be working your way from oysters with a lime and black-pepper mignonette and a sambal cocktail sauce, to snow-crab claws with a chunky and char-flecked romesco, to chilled prawns that taste of garlic, laksa leaf and smoke.\n           \n\n            Another portal into a meal, one that better suggests the kitchen\u2019s reach, is a charcuterie plate: thin mahogany slices of lamb ham; a floppy, spicy sausage something like mortadella crossed with \u2019nduja; spoonfuls of salty pork fat, melting away under bread warm off the grill; strips of Singaporean candied bacon; a slab of Vietnamese pork meatloaf, liberated from banh mi at last, and excellent with some chopped fermented cabbage. The only dull item of the bunch was the smoked curried duck, a bit dry and not especially curried.\n           \n\n            The cabbage relish may or may not be Mr. Ng\u2019s homage to choucroute, but his pot-au-feu has more obvious ancestors. The clarity and focus of the broth, along with the tenderness of the braised short rib, come from the classic French pot roast; the star anise and cinnamon in the broth are borrowed from Vietnamese pho. The short rib had something in common with corned beef, too, which along with the cabbage and mustard made me wonder whether the Irish weren\u2019t also mixed up in this remarkable dish somehow.\n           \n\n            It\u2019s the lamb breast, though, that really shows off Mr. Ng\u2019s skill for harnessing the energies of his ingredients. Cumin seeds and Sichuan peppercorns have been stuck on the meat, and then a big flame-red gob of sambal has been dropped on top. Sesame sauce and a bed of jasmine rice lap up the spices. The dish could have landed like a brick to the back of the head, but its powerful flavors are handled with some delicacy.\n           \n\n            Nothing about Cassia is small. Not the dining room, not the menu, not the well-priced wine list, which covers about 80 bottles from Europe and the West Coast, and not the portions, which are really and truly meant for sharing. My table of three never made it to the bottom of a bowl of chickpeas sunk in a lush coconut yellow curry, as delicious as they were pinched in crisp triangles of flatbread from the clay oven. I left some of the charcuterie fried rice behind, too, even though I\u2019d kept going back in for another taste of sweet lap cheong, pork fat and salted fish long after I\u2019d stopped feeling hungry.\n           \n\n            On the other hand, my appetite was still intact when I lost interest in the jellyfish salad, the name an unsuccessful attempt to rebrand a sesame-chicken salad that would have been called \u201coriental\u201d in the 1980s.\n           \n\n            Meals glide on currents of fish sauce and lime juice, steered by the staff\u2019s attention to the mechanics of family-style service. Serving spoons arrive before you can ask, and bowls that are wet with the anchovy broth that is poured over black cod will be cleared and replaced before you\u2019re brought the grilled pork belly over Vietnamese vermicelli noodles, slick with a dressing that is a little more concentrated and caramel-rich than usual.\n           \n\n            If there are any doubts that Cassia has a thick Gallic streak, the floating islands will dispel them. Yes, the puffs of meringue bobbing in lime cr\u00e8me anglaise are browned, but this is unmistakably the dessert that has disappeared into the mouths of a million French citizens. There is also a tart of dark chocolate with bananas in a pastry shell that is classically crisp.\n           \n\n            If I were to recommend one meal that captures some of the energy in the Los Angeles dining scene right now, I might come up with reasons not to mention Cassia. It is an outlier. It\u2019s not exploring new horizons in fermentation, like\n            \n             Baroo\n            \n            . It doesn\u2019t offer a direct connection to another country\u2019s cuisine, like the dizzyingly good Sichuan mini-chain Chengdu Taste. It isn\u2019t impossibly, irresistibly tiny, like\n            \n             Petit Trois\n            \n            or\n            \n             Le Comptoir\n            \n            . It doesn\u2019t have the take-it-or-leave-it bravura of\n            \n             Night & Market (Song)\n            \n            . It isn\u2019t alluringly scruffy, like\n            \n             Gjusta\n            \n            , serving bialys to Venice beach bums. It\u2019s not making an explicit appeal to the generation that grew up thinking of Los Angeles as the easternmost city in Asia, as\n            \n             Roy Choi\u2019s places\n            \n            do.\n           \n\n            All these other options would flash through my mind. And then I\u2019d wonder if maybe I were overthinking the question. Because, while Cassia is not the epitome of any particular trend, most of the food coming out of its kitchen is just really delicious.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 169, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/07/dining/cassia-santa-monica-restaurant-review-pete-wells.html", "google_mag": 24.600000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n            April Bloomfield and Ken Friedman\u2019s newest restaurant, inside the Pod 51 Hotel on East 51st Street, is called\n            \n             Salvation Burger\n            \n            . I can\u2019t say that the first word of the name filled me with hope. The last time this chef and her business partner offered us salvation in a Pod hotel, they gave us\n            \n             Salvation Taco\n            \n            , a thronged taqueria designed for, and seemingly run by, people who don\u2019t know what a taco is.\n           \n\n            That second word was promising, though. Ms. Bloomfield definitely knows what a burger is.\n           \n\n            There are many good things on her menu at the Spotted Pig, the first restaurant she opened with Mr. Friedman. But each time I ate there recently to see how it was settling into its second decade, it was Ms. Bloomfield\u2019s burger I saw on almost every table, high and proud next to a tumbleweed of shoestring fries. And it\u2019s her lamb patty under feta and onions at\n            \n             the Breslin\n            \n            that is most likely to tempt diners away from the other meaty, fatty delights.\n           \n\n            At Salvation Burger, she zeros in on what the people want and dispenses with almost everything else. Three of the five main courses are burgers, and all five come on a bun. She also knocks out bar snacks like popcorn and beef jerky, along with salads and pies, but nobody will accuse Ms. Bloomfield of padding the menu.\n           \n\n            The beef burgers come in two forms, highbrow and lowbrow.\n           \n\n            Representing the former is the Salvation Burger itself, a tall, tender half-pound patty of ground beef with cheese and mushrooms on a sesame seed bun. Servers like to say this is \u201ccooked like a steak,\u201d but not many restaurant steaks are grilled over a wood fire. Maybe they should be. This burger combines a dark crust that has the specific flavor of charred beef with a soft interior evenly cooked to medium-rare so when you bite down, it surrenders its warm pink juices.\n           \n\n            Slumped in a dirty tank top in the lowbrow corner is a double-decker burger called the Classic. If the Salvation Burger tastes like a steakhouse, this one tastes like America. The two patties, pancaked to a blackening crunch on the griddle, sprawl beyond the borders of the bun, running with \u201cspecial sauce\u201d and yellow cheese that works as a second sauce. Pickles are hiding inside, good ones, but everything on this burger comes together in a single impression that bypasses analytical thinking and goes directly to raw, thumping want.\n           \n\n            The Salvation and the Classic would seem to cover the twin poles of burger lust, but for those who aren\u2019t moved by beef, Ms. Bloomfield makes a vegetarian patty of carrots and lentils threaded by clear vermicelli of sweet potato starch. The spices are Indian and the effect is excellent; it is not a meat substitute but a very flavorful concoction in its own right.\n           \n\n            Whether you want the fried fish sandwich depends on whether you can be content with the taste of tartar sauce while everyone around you is wiping beef fat from their lips. That the sauce is whipped up in the kitchen probably won\u2019t be the deciding factor either way, just as knowing that Ms. Bloomfield is turning Cheddar into a facsimile of American cheese won\u2019t be a huge consideration for those who want the Classic. (The kitchen\u2019s motto could be \u201csimple food the hard way.\u201d)\n           \n\n            The house-baked buns, on the other hand, do make a difference. The top-split roll with a Parker House flavor is a major contributor to the all-around excellence of the oversize hot dog that runs with juices like an Italian sausage when you break its seared skin. Buried under a spicy confetti of giardiniera, the hot dog is this restaurant\u2019s sleeper.\n           \n\n            At $14, will it become a hit? The $25 price on the Salvation Burger doesn\u2019t seem to have hurt it, even though fries cost another $7. (These sagged with oil the first time I tried them, but stood up straight as Popsicle sticks on later visits.)\n           \n\n            I couldn\u2019t warm up to the incongruous combination of sweet cocktail sauce and garlic butter on the wood-roasted oysters, but I\u2019d come back again just for Salvation Burger\u2019s rich and bittersweet chili, made with the shanks from the sides of beef that are broken down and aged in the kitchen, on their way to burgerhood.\n           \n\n            For dessert, what else but pie? The standard pies still need work. The crusts are both too thin and too soft, and the ones with a thick dairy layer, like the banana cream pie with translucent banana chips stuck into its surface like armor, aren\u2019t as creamy as they should be. Far more appealing are the fried pies, golden rectangles filled with apples or blueberries. All they are missing is a wax-paper envelope to pick them up with. They taste better when you eat them with your hands.\n           \n\n            Even with dessert and a wait for a table, a meal at Salvation Burger won\u2019t swallow your entire night. This isn\u2019t the case at the Spotted Pig. The crowds haven\u2019t thinned appreciably since the place opened in 2004, and you still can\u2019t reserve. Once you\u2019re finally seated, a three-course dinner can take a couple of hours. After my most-recent dinners there, I left thinking that there had to be more rewarding ways to spend the evening.\n           \n\n            One time, my party of four was quoted a 90-minute wait. We passed the time at an extremely pleasant cocktail bar down the street,\n            \n             Orient Express\n            \n            . When no text had come through after an hour and a half, one of us went back to check. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at another 45 minutes,\u201d a host said. No apology, no smile. In fact, we were seated much sooner than that, but our moods were scuffed.\n           \n\n            Another night, another cooling-off period, another what-do-\n            \n             you\n            \n            -want greeting: Our server, when she finally noticed our table, stood next to it and said nothing. This was a little tense. Finally one of us blurted, \u201cWe\u2019re ready to order some stuff.\u201d\n           \n\n            \u201cSome stuff or all the stuff?\u201d she asked. The servers at Spotted Pig give the impression that they are going to get up to something at the end of their shift that\u2019s more interesting than whatever I\u2019m going to do. This can be charming except when they seem in a hurry to get there.\n           \n\n            When they finally let you eat, the food can be wonderful. The smoked haddock chowder is a creamy bowl of winter solace, and when it was succeeded on the menu by a minted sweet pea soup with soft shredded ham hock, I cheered for spring. I loved being reunited with an old Pig standby, the bitter green salad with lobes of lemon pulp and pigs\u2019 ears fried to a crackerlike lightness, and I have a new appreciation for the plump mussels in a lightly sour curry that tastes of toasted spices.\n           \n\n            But there can be a haphazardness to the cooking that wasn\u2019t always part of the bargain. The much-praised sheep\u2019s milk gnocchi can be gummy and dense, the chicken liver toasts can be oversweetened with reduced Port and Madeira, and a big slug of horseradish cream was so cold it cooled the skirt steak it was plopped on top of.\n           \n\n            When the Spotted Pig\n            \n             was last reviewed\n            \n            in The New York Times, in 2006, Frank Bruni added up the pleasures and subtracted the inconveniences to come up with a one-star rating. Ten years later, the equation is slightly different, but the sum is the same.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 170, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/20/dining/salvation-burger-spotted-pig-review.html", "google_mag": 25.899999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n            Keeping good small restaurants to myself is not what I\u2019m paid for. Sure, I\u2019ve enjoyed finding empty seats every night I\u2019ve eaten at\n            \n             Mr. Donahue\u2019s\n            \n            and\n            \n             Ruffian Wine Bar & Chef\u2019s Table\n            \n            . Yes, I worry that both places would capsize under the strain of a party of six, let alone a full crew of hungry New York Times readers. But I didn\u2019t take a newspaper job to keep secrets. I did it for the company stock.\n           \n\n            The smaller of the two is Mr. Donahue\u2019s, although this is like a contest between a lentil and a chickpea. There are four chairs at two tables. Very nearby at the counter are five stools. Sitting at one, you see dime-store jars of hard candy, a lamp with a fringed pink shade, a Depression glass vase under a cloud of baby\u2019s breath. You see a wicker monkey hanging by one arm above a window into the kitchen, where chickens make leisurely circles on a rotisserie.\n           \n\n            Most of these items were bought by the couple who own the restaurant, the chefs Ann Redding and Matt Danzer, who also own\n            \n             Uncle Boons\n            \n            . But the way they\u2019ve put it together, everything just seems to have gradually accumulated over the decades. It\u2019s as if you\u2019d stepped into one of the little lunch counters with unpremeditated d\u00e9cor that used to be found in this part of town before it was called NoLIta.\n           \n\n            Five main courses and about twice as many side dishes are spelled in white on a letter board that has a blue-and-red Pepsi logo at the top. You pick two sides and a sauce at no extra cost. They will be served next to your main course on a sectioned china or glass plate, each in its own well, another tune from the past.\n           \n\n            We\u2019re not supposed to want to eat this way anymore. Maybe that\u2019s why, when I got my chicken-fried pork cheeks with Swiss chard and crab imperial, I was filled with gratitude. The chard was cooked with a little garlic and lemon and bread crumbs. The crab tasted of mayonnaise and Tabasco and had been browned and warmed inside a heavy foil dish in the shape of a crab shell. I spread it on saltines from a crinkly cellophane wrapper and ate it with the sensation of having found something I\u2019d lost such a long time ago that I\u2019d forgotten about it.\n           \n\n            Under rough whorls of golden batter, the cheeks were more tender and juicy than chicken-fried steak ever is. I ate them with a fine sauce of button mushrooms and Marsala, not too sweet. The romesco sauce \u2014 unorthodox, with more spicy red oil than usual \u2014 was very good with a whole porgy or the broiled steak of steelhead trout that replaced it. Honest-to-goodness gravy, rounded and meaty-tasting, is what you want with the\n            \n             heroic slab of roast beef\n            \n            . The beef was thoroughly rosy except at the edges, where it had a salty, crunchy, herb-flecked crust.\n           \n\n            The rotisserie chicken tasted like rotisserie chicken.\n           \n\n            With so few voices in the room, you almost always hear the music, which is soft and sounds as if it were coming from a tube radio that is still picking up an AM show that was broadcast a couple of years before the Beatles played Shea Stadium. It\u2019s all big bands and crooners singing sweet words that are sad underneath, like \u201cI\u2019ll be seeing you in all the old familiar places.\u201d (The only place he\u2019ll be seeing her is in his head.)\n           \n\n            Cheap nostalgia hands you a fake past to make you smile. True nostalgia is mixed with pain because it conjures a past that was real and isn\u2019t coming back. The nostalgia Ms. Redding and Mr. Danzer bring to Mr. Donahue\u2019s is the second kind. Every detail shows their longing for the bygone world of Mr. Danzer\u2019s grandfather Frank Donahue. He was a detective. His police cap sits on a shelf.\n           \n\n            For dessert, there is a root-beer float, if that\u2019s what you want. Me, I\u2019ll probably keep ordering the banana pudding forever, or until this mirage on Mott Street goes under and joins the past.\n           \n\n\n\n            Just west of Tompkins Square Park in the East Village, Ruffian Wine Bar & Chef\u2019s Table has more seats but not much more space. There\u2019s barely enough room to squeeze your way to an empty stool at the concrete counter. The ones who are really in a tight spot, though, are the two chefs,\n            \n             Josh Ochoa and Andy Alexandre\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            Jammed behind one end of the counter, they arrange cheeses with house-made jam, warm some marinated olives that are as smoky as bacon, toast sliced baguettes for a knockout tomato chutney, plate some crisp, young radishes with bagna cauda, spread out sliced cross sections of fennel bulbs marinated simply and deliciously with sherry vinegar and fennel seeds, and plunge an immersion blender into batters that will go into the tiny convection oven and emerge as three-inch souffl\u00e9s.\n           \n\n            The cheese souffl\u00e9, almost like a tower of soft scrambled eggs, makes a lush spread for toast darkened with a swirl of balsamic vinegar. The last time I went, it had been replaced by an equally good one with crab.\n           \n\n            I expected to like the beef tartare, but its sherry vinegar dressing made it too soupy and sour. I had no expectations of lentil salad, but it\u2019s one of the best things on the menu. A variety of lentils and other legumes are firm, separate, not at all mushy, seasoned with dried chiles and curry leaves, swirled with yogurt sauce, and sprinkled with crisp threads of sev, the chickpea-flour snacks. Suddenly, dull old lentil salad is an exciting Indian street festival. (Mr. Ochoa and Mr. Alexandre met Patrick Cournot, an owner and a sommelier at Ruffian, when they all worked at Tabla.)\n           \n\n            There is usually a savory pie, either a big and imposing thing to be carved into wedges, or a small turnover filled let\u2019s say with a well-seasoned mince of rabbit meat.\n           \n\n            The profiteroles are odd and overelaborated, with an acidic cream of mandarin oranges. The chocolate souffl\u00e9 is better, if you have time to wait. In this kitchen, the only way to cook is one dish at a time.\n           \n\n            But of course you have time; you\u2019re here to drink wine from a list that evidences Mr. Cournot\u2019s open-minded curiosity. Like every other wine bar in town, Ruffian stocks some stars of the natural wine movement. It\u2019s also picking up on the Georgian signals coming out of the Caucasus. But other choices show an independence from the latest trends, like a violet-scented pinot noir from Chile.\n           \n\n            Elena Hull Cournot, Mr. Cournot\u2019s wife, has given this tight alley a surprisingly light, almost airy design, although the detail I remember most is the portrait of a horse on the back wall. She painted it with it a garland of orange flowers around its neck, like a lei. It has kind eyes and a nonjudgmental expression, fine traits in a portrait that hangs in a bar. A friend who has a lot of horse sense said, \u201cThe horse looks wise.\u201d\n           \n\n            Horse, I\u2019ll be seeing you.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 171, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/01/dining/mr-donahues-ruffian-wine-bar-restaurant-review.html", "google_mag": 21.700000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n            Searching for money, for love and for food, we strike bargains. We may be content with one for years until we begin to be shadowed by the suspicion that the terms aren\u2019t working out in our favor anymore.\n           \n\n            That doubt nagged me at\n            \n             Momofuku Nishi\n            \n            , which the chef David Chang opened in Chelsea in January. Early in his career, with\n            \n             Momofuku Noodle Bar\n            \n            and\n            \n             Momofuku Ssam Bar\n            \n            , Mr. Chang and his customers struck a deal that made decades of dining tradition look obsolete. He and his cooks could make Asian ingredients bend in new directions.\n           \n\n            The cooking could be gloriously unwholesome or willfully esoteric or stunningly precise, but it was never quite like anything else out there. In return for tasting these new sensations, Mr. Chang\u2019s customers gave up amenities that used to be automatic at restaurants hoping to be taken seriously.\n           \n\n            When it comes to inflicting discomfort, Nishi still holds up its end of the bargain. You can make reservations, but not for a table, most of which are long and low; you\u2019re likely to share yours with strangers. Instead, you reserve a chair, which, strictly speaking, is a seat built like a hard, flat crate.\n           \n\n            Ssam Bar has similar seating, but the lighting is more seductive and the noise level is less throttling. At Nishi, highly sensitive microphones seem to be placed directly above all the loudest people, picking up and amplifying their every screech.\n           \n\n            Mr. Chang\n            \n             told the Eater restaurant critic Ryan Sutton\n            \n            in March, when Nishi was two months old, that the acoustics \u201chave to get better.\u201d Reading that, I stayed away for six weeks, hoping for improvements. When I returned, the only obvious change was that more sound-dampening tiles had been affixed to the ceiling. If they helped, I couldn\u2019t tell. In a phone interview, Mr. Chang told me he is \u201cgoing crazy about the sound, but we are working actively to do the best we can.\u201d Nishi is still as loud as the opening face-off of Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals.\n           \n\n            Temporary soreness of the butt and throat were always potential downsides of a Momofuku meal. Back when we first agreed to the bargain, though, the food was so distractingly original and good that you wouldn\u2019t have minded eating it while leaning up against a Dumpster in an alley sharing your chopsticks with\n            \n             GG Allin\n            \n            . At Nishi, you mind.\n           \n\n            The strongest dishes are exquisitely controlled plates of cold vegetables or protein that could easily fit into the lineup of a marathon menu at\n            \n             Momofuku Ko\n            \n            , the tasting counter where Nishi\u2019s executive chef, Joshua Pinsky, cooked for more than five years.\n           \n\n            Shavings of watermelon radishes and raw beef veined with white fat are sprinkled with ponzu-enhanced dashi and a Spanish olive oil that really stands out. Threads of celery curl around raw mackerel, given a breath of char and bathed in a soy analogue fermented from rye, with a precise flicker of yuzu. Sea scallops dusted with salted, dried kelp rise from a green juice that tastes like cucumbers, peppers and herbs \u2014 or maybe it\u2019s just wheatgrass? These dishes and others like them are extraordinarily good because the ingredients are allowed to speak quietly.\n           \n\n            But when the kitchen reaches for the throttle, the results can be muddled or muted.\n           \n\n            Snails and anchovies seemed to be straining to keep a $55 prime rib from seeming ordinary and slightly dry. Where was the salted crust? Where was the invitation to give in to fleshy temptations held out by Ssam Bar\u2019s rotisserie duck or its pork shoulder?\n           \n\n            Mackerel was almost perfectly cooked, but nothing about it made me want to come back for more, not the lukewarm daikon hiding under it nor the barbecue sauce spread on top, a blend so complex and balanced it canceled itself out.\n           \n\n            Allegedly, Nishi is Mr. Chang\u2019s foray into Italy, although that\u2019s not at all apparent until you dip into the noodles. The clams grand Lisboa is, I guess, a twist on spaghetti alle vongole. The fun of it is the way skinny chow mein noodles have been toasted before cooking, so you get some soft strands and some crackly ones in the same bite.\n           \n\n            Footnotes on the right side of the menu provide cryptic references to source materials. The one for the chitarra points toward the chef\n            \n             Mark Ladner\n            \n            \u2019s pasta with crab meat and jalape\u00f1os. That dish is memorable. The Nishi version is not. Mr. Ladner\u2019s bright clarity is replaced with a confusion of dried squid, XO sauce, fermented chiles and chile paste. One time it was spicy but too sweet; another time it was less sweet but not spicy enough.\n           \n\n            The dish everybody talks about is called ceci e pepe, a takeoff on cacio e pepe made with chickpea hozon, a fermented paste made and sold in tiny amounts by Momofuku. Hozon does taste a bit like cheese, but not like the pecorino used in a classic cacio e pepe \u2014 it\u2019s missing that wild pasture flavor of sheep\u2019s milk. The dish is also missing a few degrees of heat; like some of the other noodles, ceci e pepe has a habit of arriving lukewarm.\n           \n\n            A homage this far off the mark would be fine if the goal were to avoid animal fats, but butter slips around the strands of house-made bucatini. I don\u2019t know why this dish exists, except to find a use for\n            \n             a proprietary Momofuku product\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            Too much of the cooking at Nishi is self-referential, inward looking and so concerned with technique that you can\u2019t help being conscious of it. In his early days, Mr. Chang served the kind of food chefs like to eat: intense, animalistic, O.K. with messiness, indifferent to prettiness. Nishi serves the kind of food chefs cook to impress one another.\n           \n\n            As Mr. Chang\u2019s operation has grown into a global concern with branches in Australia and Canada, his restaurants started to offer amenities that were once unimaginable. The cocktails at Nishi, like the margarita with an absinthe rinse, are clever in the right way. There is satisfying range on the wine list, too; the nuanced Farrside pinot noir from Australia is a far cry from the sparkling shiraz that was one of the only bottles Ssam Bar carried in its first year.\n           \n\n            If dinner in Changland now includes intelligent drinking, why can\u2019t it also encompass seating and acoustics that won\u2019t leave your lower back in knots and your eardrums in shreds?\n           \n\n            When we made our original deal with Momofuku, we were all kinds of swept away by the rush of flavors we had never encountered before. Now that Mr. Chang has a dozen years\u2019 worth of prot\u00e9g\u00e9s and copycats, now that he even seems to be copying himself, now that the rest of us have cooler heads and other options, it\u2019s time to take another look at that bargain.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 172, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/dining/momofuku-nishi-review.html", "google_mag": 23.5}, {"review_text": "\n            When the waiter asked if we wanted the last roasted goat\u2019s head, I didn\u2019t think it was a big deal. It was just another night at\n            \n             Babbo\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            This was around 1999, a year after it had opened, when Babbo had few peers among Italian restaurants, serving unusual meats with a side of light decadence. In this classically simple Greenwich Village townhouse, an energetic and pleasure-seeking chef named Mario Batali wanted New Yorkers to try something new: a salad of truffled lamb\u2019s tongue; melting pink windowpanes of head cheese; triangles of beef-cheek-filled pasta in a sauce thickened by crushed squab livers. The strategy was to tempt us and dare us at the same time.\n           \n\n            Back then, Babbo funneled you toward giving up all restraint, right down to the wine pours, which were sold by thirds of a bottle instead of fifths. So when the chance to eat a goat\u2019s head was dangled before me, I saw it as the natural outgrowth of an entire philosophy of eating and drinking that I wanted to adopt as my own, at least for as long as it took to find out which parts of the face were good to eat (the sides) and which weren\u2019t (the eyes).\n           \n\n            Mr. Batali and his business partner, Joe Bastianich, now own\n            \n             about two dozen restaurants\n            \n            in the United States and Asia. Babbo remains the empire\u2019s spiritual home, where the original formula of adventure and pleasure and curious-minded indulgence is still intact, where you can still try recipes that sprang from Mr. Batali\u2019s forehead when he was only a minor celebrity.\n           \n\n            Now that he\u2019s superfamous, Mr. Batali could probably pump up the prices at Babbo. He hasn\u2019t. That\u2019s one reason Babbo is still one of New York\u2019s essential restaurants. But it isn\u2019t quite the same restaurant. The cooking doesn\u2019t always have the old finesse and bravado that my colleague Frank Bruni found when he\n            \n             gave the restaurant three stars\n            \n            in 2004, when it was last reviewed in The Times. The service, meanwhile, can go in and out of focus more than it used to.\n           \n\n            From the restaurant\u2019s beginning, overbooking has been an issue. Even now, when reservations are not as much in demand, the bar is often crowded with people waiting to be seated.\n           \n\n            This narrow area is less a waiting room than an exercise studio. One recent night, three guests and I ducked and bobbed and turned every minute or so as somebody tried to squeeze through with a hot plate of food, or an empty chair, or an armful of coats. This lasted 30 minutes. We never got an apology, but we did get to work on our balance and core strength.\n           \n\n            What bothered me more than not hearing \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d was that nobody acted as though half an hour was an unusually long time to keep customers waiting.\n           \n\n            At the table, the style of service I got seemed to depend on whether I was there for the first or second seating. An early-evening dinner rolled along like a skateboard on new concrete, and the check came with the coffee. A meal that began after 8 p.m. was slow, even draggy, and at times it seemed we had dropped out of sight. Our sommelier was smart and engaging as he talked about a Sardinian red we were curious about (as ever, the all-Italian wine list is a mix of blue chips and underrated discoveries), but after decanting it, he was nowhere to be seen and our glasses stood empty.\n           \n\n            On another night, four people ordered appetizers, but only three of us got them.\n           \n\n            Mr. Batali discusses changes to the menu every week with Frank Langello, Babbo\u2019s executive chef since 2003. Mr. Langello\u2019s kitchen is run by professionals who seem to know by instinct when to take meat off the flame; even tricky ingredients like rabbit were faultlessly done. Given how many classic dishes are on the menu, the cooks could probably make half of them with their eyes closed. Sometimes you wonder if they do.\n           \n\n            I suspected that the salt had been left out of the soupy polenta served under Babbo\u2019s long-running (and still terrific) beef braised in red wine, the brasato al Barolo.\n           \n\n            A salad of lamb\u2019s tongue and browned beech mushrooms topped with a soft-cooked egg was nice. But the salad was warm and the egg was cold, so it was not as nice as it could have been. I felt the same way about a grilled guinea hen leg; it would have been easier to love if the skin hadn\u2019t been rubbery and damp.\n           \n\n            And a banana crostata could have been exceptional if its crust hadn\u2019t been soft and its flavors melded together, as if it had been made too early in the day.\n           \n\n            These glitches were far from catastrophic, but they were frustrating because I could usually imagine, or remember, just how good the dish was supposed to be.\n           \n\n            And with some recipes, there was no need to imagine. Babbo\u2019s pasta station can still turn out the hit singles with plenty of the old shimmy-shimmy-shake, like the beef-cheek ravioli or the \u201cmint love letters,\u201d parcels of minty lamb sausage under a bright tomato sauce.\n           \n\n            Some of Babbo\u2019s most exciting pastas stand on more delicate flavors. Goat cheese tortelloni, like little folded paper hats, were slithery with warm butter that was seasoned by dried orange peel and fennel pollen: lovely and transporting. And when the calendar said spring was here, the kitchen was ready with asparagus tossed with tender, slick fettuccine and brittle crinkles of saut\u00e9ed pancetta.\n           \n\n            Rebecca DeAngelis\u2019s desserts are memorable, too; that glum banana crostata was an outlier. The saffron panna cotta is seductively musky, its perfume offset by dried apricots soaked in passion fruit pur\u00e9e. And the friends with whom I shared the olive oil cake \u2014 a simple drum with a crisp top and a tender middle, splashed with a bright-green squiggle of peppery olive oil \u2014 still text me about once a day to ask if I remember how wonderful it was. I do.\n           \n\n            To say that Babbo\u2019s long suits are its pasta and desserts is just to praise those courses, not to diminish the others. Antipasti, like the steamed mussels poured with their garlic-laden juices over thick toast, or the octopus and just-tender borlotti beans in a fantastic, citrus-packed, lightly spicy limoncello vinaigrette, manage to be very active without seeming frantic.\n           \n\n            Mr. Batali and Mr. Langello work hard to chase boredom away, but they know when to stop, and you can see that in such main courses as the pork chop, so plump it could pass for a baby ham, with cherry peppers, or the lamb chops you could pick up by the bone if you didn\u2019t mind getting broccoli rabe pesto on your fingers.\n           \n\n            Still, I keep thinking about goat\u2019s head. In those early days, I knew Babbo could ace the weird stuff. I\u2019m not sure I trust the restaurant the same way today. Then again, I\u2019m not sure I want another goat\u2019s head, either.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 173, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/dining/babbo-review-pete-wells.html", "google_mag": 25.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n            Sitting at the upstairs bar, one of the best places to eat in the new\n            \n             Union Square Cafe\n            \n            , I listened in on a conversation the woman next to me was having with the bartender. In December, after a year out of operation, Danny Meyer\u2019s first and most formative restaurant had been transferred from its original address on East 16th Street to the corner of Park Avenue South and East 19th. The woman had been transferred, too; a regular at the old location, she had some pointed questions about a certain item on the menu.\n           \n\n            \u201cIs it the same?\u201d she asked. \u201c\n            \n             Exactly\n            \n            the same?\u201d\n           \n\n            The bartender assured her that it was. \u201cIf we ever took it off the menu, we\u2019d have a riot on our hands,\u201d he said.\n           \n\n            The item in question was a salad of red-tipped oakleaf and Bibb lettuces, with some fresh and springy croutons and whitecaps of grated Gruy\u00e8re on top. It is a very nice salad, a model of good behavior. It does not bring to mind images of mob violence. This is Union Square Cafe, though, a place that from the beginning has inspired attachments of a peculiar intensity.\n           \n\n            Other restaurants have customers; Union Square Cafe has fans, and knows it. Almost everything about the new place caters to their memories of the original, fetishizing the restaurant\u2019s own idiosyncrasies to an amazing degree. It\u2019s almost a museum to itself. If you\u2019re not part of the fan base, you might feel a bit like somebody who goes to see \u201cRogue One\u201d without ever having seen \u201cStar Wars.\u201d\n           \n\n            At the old location, I was more an admirer than a fan. I was never quite as amazed by the food as it seemed I was supposed to be. But then, fluctuation is normal in a long-running restaurant. Over the years, reviews of Union Square Cafe in The Times have ranged from\n            \n             two\n            \n            to\n            \n             three stars\n            \n            . In\n            \n             the most recent appraisal\n            \n            , in 2009, Frank Bruni awarded it two.\n           \n\n\n             The Rockwell Group\n            \n            , the architecture firm, was given\n            \n             the job of evoking the old address\n            \n            in a space that is much roomier, without the narrow passageways and sunken dining room. Some of this is done subliminally: Pendant lamps downstairs hang at the height of the 16th Street ceilings. I could swear the original downstairs bar was smaller, but that\u2019s probably because I could almost never get a seat there. Mr. Rockwell swears that the new one is the same length: 27 feet 1 inch.\n           \n\n            The upstairs bar top where my cocktail rested was precisely the size of the old upstairs bar top because it was, in fact, the same piece of wood with a fresh coat of varnish. The art collection has come along for the ride, too, and one of the pleasures of the Rockwell layout is the way you seem to bump into a Frank Stella or a Claes Oldenburg or a Judy Rifka every time you turn around.\n           \n\n            The cellar stocks wines from Italy, France and the United States, and nowhere else. As Jason Wagner, the wine director, explained one night, those are the countries that were on the list when Union Square Cafe opened in 1985.\n           \n\n            The menu does not go so far as to point out all the old showstoppers \u2014 some from Michael Romano\u2019s reign in the kitchen and others from that of the current chef, Carmen Quagliata \u2014 but the servers are happy to help. Do I even need to say this? It\u2019s the most famous thing about Union Square Cafe: The servers are always happy to help.\n           \n\n            I hadn\u2019t realized the salad was a cult object, but I did know about the gnocchi. In this case, I stand with the cult. They are not so much gnocchi as little cushions of ricotta that have been tricked into holding their cylindrical shape only for as long as it takes to move them from the plate to the mouth.\n           \n\n            Consider me a fanboy when it comes to the ideally crunchy fritto misto, and the polenta, too, a $13 bowl of warm fluff that has absorbed its weight, and then some, in milk and creamy young cow\u2019s milk cheese. With maitake mushrooms and shiny green pesto, it\u2019s so filling and likable that you could make a meal of it and walk away more content than if you\u2019d had a 12-course tasting somewhere else.\n           \n\n            The risk in churning out old recipes like this is that the kitchen becomes bored, and the food boring. That\u2019s not happening at Union Square Cafe right now; the cooks seem to have dialed right in on the qualities that made these dishes favorites in the first place.\n           \n\n            Union Square Cafe has always been the offspring of a mixed marriage between a trattoria and a bistro, with an American bar and grill somewhere in the family tree. In the current phenotype, the trattoria genes are dominant.\n           \n\n            There is a wonderfully tender and gentle rabbit sugo, tossed with bands of pappardelle. Mr. Quagliata\u2019s pasta work can be just as satisfying when he carves out new traditions, tossing tubes of rigatoni with roasted carrots and sizzled scallions and chiles, then brightening the flavors with a spoonful of yogurt.\n           \n\n            A little less thrilling was a lasagna Bolognese that has been rotated off the menu for the time being; while the pasta sheets were as thin and light as any Italian could hope for, the flavors in the meat sauce weren\u2019t as developed as they might have been.\n           \n\n            Though I split that lasagna with somebody else so we could have traditional appetizer-primi-secondi meals, the mains are so imposing that a simple two-course plan is the wiser path. I was nearly done in by a braised lamb shank, although the bright salsa verde helped spur me along. Even the choices that sound lighter, like red snapper sandwiched between a thatch of shaved puntarelle and a bed of chickpea pur\u00e9e, or a flattened half-chicken, with cumin and dried chiles embedded in its surface and slabs of white sweet potato peeking out from below, are best tackled with an undented appetite.\n           \n\n            After all: There will be dessert, and it will not be a minor event, especially if somebody at your table has strong memories of the panna cotta (beautiful; the pastry chef, Daniel Alvarez, surrounds it with citrus segments and granola), or the pumpkin bread pudding (more bread than pudding when I last saw it), or the fantastic tart topped with a caramelized puff of banana so soft it seems to have blown apart.\n           \n\n            Sometimes Union Square Cafe\u2019s eagerness to please has something close to the opposite effect. When a server suggested with wide-eyed eagerness that I might like \u201ca very cold glass of milk\u201d with the espresso-chocolate cake, chills went down my spine, and not chills of anticipation. The last time I drank milk with a meal, I was wearing footed pajamas.\n           \n\n            Then I\u2019d remember how happy the service had made one of my guests, who had shown up before me, but still about 30 seconds too late to grab a seat at the downstairs bar. She spun around in agitation for a moment, but a manager spotted her and offered to call upstairs to see if there were any open bar stools there.\n           \n\n            This empathic attunement to disturbances in the Force defines the Meyer brand of hospitality. While it flows through\n            \n             all his restaurants\n            \n            , it functions in its purest and most effective form at Union Square Cafe.\n           \n\n            The restaurant is far too nice to be polarizing, but it won\u2019t be everybody\u2019s cold glass of milk. Diners from the Instagram generation might want more crunch, more adventure or more spontaneity. I hope that as it settles into its new home, it gets a little less self-referential. But even now, it has a combination of energy and well-honed familiarity that\u2019s rare in Manhattan. It\u2019s rare anywhere, and it lifts this restaurant above fashion, to a plateau that it occupies all by itself.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 174, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/dining/union-square-cafe-review.html", "google_mag": 28.600000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n            ABC Kitchen signified a small turning point in the appetites of New Yorkers when it opened seven years ago. We had snuffled through much of the previous decade in search of pork shoulders, lamb belly, rib-eyes and marrow bones, and if we didn\u2019t exactly wake up on the first day of 2010 doubled over with regret, some of us were starting to wonder why the bed smelled like bacon.\n           \n\n            Then that spring we got\n            \n             ABC Kitchen\n            \n            , with\n            \n             Dan Kluger\n            \n            in the kitchen, Jean-Georges Vongerichten whispering in his ear and a new way of filling our stomachs on the menu.\n           \n\n            Mr. Kluger wasn\u2019t cooking health food, not with that mayo-spritzed cheeseburger. But a sizable chunk of the nearly 50 dishes were salads or saladlike constructions. Vegetables were everywhere, including on top of the whole-wheat pizzas. The plates jangled with flavor, and very little of it came from animal fat. We might have called the food \u201cvegetable forward\u201d if that term had been invented.\n           \n\n            When diners stood up at the end of the night, you could almost hear them sighing with relief that they\u2019d had an entire meal in a hot downtown restaurant without eating lard.\n           \n\n            The two chefs teamed up again for\n            \n             ABC Cocina\n            \n            , which opened\n            \n             a new front on the culture wars\n            \n            by\n            \n             mashing peas into guacamole\n            \n            , before Mr. Kluger left Mr. Vongerichten\u2019s synchronized-swimming team to splash around in a pool of his own. After two years of preparation, he opened\n            \n             Loring Place\n            \n            in December in an expansive space on West Eighth Street, where the\n            \n             shoe stores used to be\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            There\u2019s a long and busy bar to the right of the entrance where the drinks list offers you very well-made classic cocktails as well as innovations that taste like classics in the making. On the left are two dining areas: one that sits on a platform in the window, and another, bigger one off the kitchen. Designed by\n            \n             Cycle Projects\n            \n            , the rooms are full of handsome expanses of white brick and stained walnut.\n           \n\n            Yes, these hard surfaces amplify the noise. Yes, they\u2019re trying to fix it.\n           \n\n            Mr. Kluger has said in interviews that at Loring Place he is bringing back some of the tricks he picked up before he learned his ABC\u2019s, while he was working under\n            \n             Floyd Cardoz\n            \n            and\n            \n             Tom Colicchio\n            \n            . That may be true of the recipes, but the template of the menu comes unmistakably from ABC Kitchen, all the way down to the whole-wheat pizzas.\n           \n\n            There are more salads at Loring Place, and the saladlike constructions are even more saladlike. At the end of winter, I loved the combination of crisp Bosc pears with soft roasted leeks over thick yogurt, and some sugar-glazed walnuts for ballast. A couple of weeks ago, with pollen in the air, I appreciated the arrival of sweet sugar snap peas, lightly charred and served with bright pink breakfast radishes and shreds of pecorino.\n           \n\n            In this herbivorous decade, Loring Place isn\u2019t the only restaurant to try grinding flour from local grains, or the only one to get mixed results. The emmer crackers, armored with sunflower seeds, are terrific with a schmear of the excellent and lightly sweet hummus. So are the breakfast radishes lodged in the surface of the hummus.\n           \n\n            A friend who knows her grains looked dubious when I ordered the house-made whole-wheat spaghetti. I was skeptical, too. (It is almost never as good as it sounds.) Loring Place gets it right, though, and lets it be, tossing it with basil, chiles, grated cheese and some velvety leaves of spinach.\n           \n\n            The whole-wheat bread, on the other hand, isn\u2019t quite at the point where Loring Place should be charging $6 for a loaf smaller than a football. The crust is impressively sturdy, but the interior is neither tender nor elastic \u2014 it\u2019s dry and crumbly.\n           \n\n            I liked the whole-wheat pizza crust enough to wish it had been allowed to breathe a little more under a mass of shaved asparagus, maitake mushrooms, jalape\u00f1os and three kinds of cheese.\n           \n\n            But I have to admit I had a hard time keeping up my interest in the other pies at Loring Place once I\u2019d eaten a square of what the menu calls \u201cgrandma-style pan pizza.\u201d Like a less doughy Sicilian baked with canned tomatoes, not sauce,\n            \n             the grandma\n            \n            has been slowly expanding its range west of its traditional breeding grounds in Nassau County. The Loring Place grandma crust is thicker than in the archetypal versions, but flavorful, light and nongreasy. I hope Mr. Kluger has stocked up on pizza pans because he runs a serious risk of selling a grandma pie to every table in the restaurant.\n           \n\n            Its only close rival on the menu is the cheeseburger, which comes with bacon made on site, a likably combative pickled-pepper aioli and a cast-iron pan of thick-cut fries that seem to get crunchier as they got cooler, a neat feature.\n           \n\n            I don\u2019t imagine Mr. Kluger wants us to think of Loring Place as a place for cheeseburgers and square pizza, but a lot of the other main courses aren\u2019t as compelling for one reason or another. Halibut with a market\u2019s worth of mixed mushrooms in miso and lemon juice was an ideal example of how to cook and serve fish, but I can\u2019t say the same about the nondescript king salmon or the sea scallops in a sauce whose naked acidity was intensified by apples marinated in vinegar.\n           \n\n            Grilled chicken breast with carrot barbecue sauce sounded more exciting than it was; the sauce never kicked in hard enough to rouse the warm peas and rice that seemed to have settled down under the chicken for a long winter\u2019s nap.\n           \n\n            As much as I want to take Loring Place on its own terms, the menu makes comparisons with ABC Kitchen inevitable, and Loring Place comes off as slightly less interesting. It\u2019s not just that a lot of it feels familiar now; some of it is also unfocused and busy. The plates have more going on, but there\u2019s not as much happening.\n           \n\n            To be fair, very few restaurants are as interesting as ABC Kitchen was when it opened, and there are solid reasons that reservations at Loring Place are hard to come by. They include the wine list, which packs a few nice surprises, not the least of which is the attention it pays to the $40 to $60 range. And they continue through the smartly nostalgic dessert menu. There\u2019s a sly update on the Hostess CupCake, a tin of cookies, and a vanilla ice-cream sundae with pretzels, toffee and whatnot, modeled on the Dairy Queen Blizzard.\n           \n\n            O.K. It\u2019s kind of like\n            \n             the sundae at ABC Kitchen\n            \n            . It\u2019s still good.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 175, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/dining/loring-place-review-greenwich-village.html", "google_mag": 25.700000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n            Visitors to Hong Kong who have an appreciation for dumplings, an eye toward low prices and faith that a single Michelin star reliably predicts quality will tend to eat at one of two places.

The very hungry ones will go to both.\n           \n\n            The two businesses have been busy exporting their folding and crimping technologies to dumpling-conscious cities around the world. With its 45th location, which opened in the East Village just before Christmas,\n            \n             Tim Ho Wan\n            \n            is the first of the pair to bring its towers of bamboo steamers to New York City.\n           \n\n            Tim Ho Wan was started by the chef\n            \n             Mak Kwai Pui,\n            \n            who had been in charge of the expensively exquisite dim sum at the Four Seasons hotel in Hong Kong. With his partner, Leung Fai Keung, his idea was to go back to basics, retaining some of the techniques and refinements of high-end dim sum while bringing prices down to sea level.\n           \n\n            In New York, the entire menu fits on a paper place mat. When you read it, it\u2019s not immediately apparent why fans were willing to\n            \n             stand on Fourth Avenue\n            \n            in the cold for hours last December simply to put their names and phone numbers on a list for the privilege of being called a few hours after that, when a table was finally free.\n           \n\n            Many items can be found for about the same price (nothing is over $6) in other dim sum parlors. Now that the lines have died down considerably, it\u2019s clear that the versions at Tim Ho Wan are good, but very few are throw-half-the-day-away good, and some have a rote quality that tends to creep into all but the most vigilant chains.\n           \n\n            True, the har gow wrappers are thinner than you expect, the shrimp inside firmer. The black bean sauce with steamed spare ribs tastes especially savory; the abalone sauce on the chicken feet a bit richer than the typical oyster sauce.\n           \n\n            The pan-fried turnip cakes contain flecks of dried shrimp that send their particular intensity in all directions. Soft as bread pudding inside, they are firmly seared, giving them an undertone of char and a hint of smoke somewhere off in the distance. The beef balls, under ragged veils of tofu skin, are the lightest and airiest I\u2019ve ever eaten.\n           \n\n            But the rice rolls, a point of pride for the chain, are white bogs of starch that blot out the underseasoned fillings of beef, pork or shrimp. I\u2019ve tried all three in New York, and they\u2019re never quite there, while the pork liver rice roll I tried at a Tim Ho Wan last month in Sydney, Australia, buzzed with ginger and scallions inside its thin and delicate wrapper.\n           \n\n            The barbecued pork buns, which make the Hong Kong airport location of Tim Ho Wan the first and last stop in town for some passengers, have been a work in progress in New York. The flaky pastry, somewhere between a Parker House roll and a Southern buttermilk biscuit, shows off Mr. Mak\u2019s finesse. The crackled surface, made of short crust dough blooped out of a pastry bag, doesn\u2019t taste like much but somehow makes the buns more exciting to eat.\n           \n\n            The trouble has been with the gooey, half-sweet filling. Back in January, there wasn\u2019t much of it, and it lacked conviction. In March, it was only slightly more sure of itself. This month, I finally had one that was richly flavored, well proportioned to the bun, and very hot.\n           \n\n            Steamed egg cake is another signature dish, or, as Tim Ho Wan puts it, one of the \u201cbig four heavenly kings.\u201d A square tan slice of it is so plain it looks like the last thing left on the table of a PTA bake sale, but it\u2019s consistently airy and wonderful, with its homey taste of molasses. It\u2019s not a dessert. It seems to go with everything on the menu.\n           \n\n            In Australia, the osmanthus jelly, which is a dessert, was a shimmering, translucent amber, saturated with the spring-fever flavors of peaches and flowers. The New York version has been rubbery, as dark as beef bouillon, and strangely bland. Far more appealing are the coins of French toast pressed together around a center of egg custard, a cross of two Hong Kong snacks bred expressly for the New York market.\n           \n\n\n\n            Din Tai Fung has almost three times as many branches as Tim Ho Wan, but for now its American presence is focused entirely on the West Coast. A few months ago, though, a restaurant in SoHo came along with a chef, Charlie Chen, who had been pried loose from the company\u2019s kitchens. The xiao long bao and other dishes at\n            \n             Pinch Chinese\n            \n            will for many New Yorkers be the first taste of the\n            \n             Din Tai Fung\n            \n            aesthetic.\n           \n\n            Mr. Chen\u2019s dumpling cooks wear masks over their mouths as they work behind glass at the end of the dining room, which gives them the air of fast-moving surgeons. The first thing you notice about their soup dumplings is that they are pretty. In other restaurants, they are baggy, saggy water balloons ready to spill their guts on impact. At Pinch, they stand upright like Hershey\u2019s Kisses, and their skins, though very thin, don\u2019t rupture when squeezed between chopsticks. A single dumpling fits quite comfortably in the mouth.\n           \n\n            Once you bite down, the broth that pours out is not as lip-smackingly gelatinous as it could be, but it\u2019s still rich and full of flavor. The best and most unusual is filled with chicken soup, and you wouldn\u2019t want it any thicker than it is. It\u2019s very good.\n           \n\n            As finely made as those are, I somewhat preferred the non-soup dumplings: the steamed half-moons stuffed with gingery flakes of fish; the ones with a dark core of minced mushrooms and truffles; or the pan-fried semicircles filled with juicy saut\u00e9ed beef, found only at lunch and brunch.\n           \n\n            Pinch also makes the best Sichuan won tons, shaped like clothesline ghosts and swimming in chile oil, that I\u2019ve tasted outside a Sichuan restaurant. Sean Tang, who owns Pinch with a cousin, Tony Li, and Mr. Chen, has said he wants the menu to be \u201cregion agnostic.\u201d Occasionally this results in stuff I might cook at home with a recipe from an American magazine, like the humdrum fried rice with steak or the pork ribs in cumin and chile seasoning. A magazine would call them Spicy Sichuan Ribs. They aren\u2019t.\n           \n\n            In general, though, the conceit works. Other Sichuan-style dishes, like the ma po tofu, make up in balance what they may lack in heat. From Taiwan, there\u2019s a highly credible three-cup chicken cooked with all dark meat (it makes a difference), as well as a hypnotically good stir-fry of cabbage with red chiles and thin slices of browned bacon.\n           \n\n            Snow Crab in a Chinese Restaurant has a generic name but a nongeneric flavor, with spicy black bean sauce over glass noodles and crab meat. The Wind Sand Chicken is a whole roast bird suffused all the way down with five-spice seasoning, then buried under a golden drift of fried garlic.\n           \n\n            It costs $45, which will strike Chinatown regulars as a large number. It will seem almost a bargain to anyone who eats in other restaurants that have wine lists like Pinch\u2019s, which takes in p\u00e9t-nats and skin-contact wines in styles from forbidding to friendly.\n           \n\n            It was put together by Miguel de Leon, who presided over the heroic cellar at Casa Mono, and you can tell he had fun with it. \u201cYou really like merlot\u201d is a phrase that turns up twice. The first time it is above the wines by the glass, all made with the grape that everybody decided was trash after\n            \n             \u201cSideways\u201d came out.\n            \n            Everybody was wrong. You really do like it.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 176, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/dining/tim-ho-wan-review-pinch-chinese-restaurant-dim-sum-dumpling.html", "google_mag": 29.0}, {"review_text": "\n            When I see something wrapped in a banana leaf, I am almost always interested in what\u2019s inside. Unwrapping one such package at\n            \n             Momofuku Ssam Bar\n            \n            recently I was extra interested, because the restaurant has a new chef named Max Ng who is a citizen of Singapore, and one of the dishes he has brought with him from that country is a whole skate wing cooked in a banana leaf.\n           \n\n            The wing was rubbed top and bottom with sambal belacan, a Malaysian sauce built on a foundation of fermented-shrimp paste. It was a little spicy and strongly, disorientingly funky in a way that gave me the feeling of trying to stand up in a small boat in high surf. On the side, Mr. Ng served a bowl of congee to act as a kind of buffer, although it was by no means bland.\n           \n\n            Under the orange belacan I could taste the green-tea flavor of the banana leaf, drawn out by steam. Mr. Ng had intensified that, too, by charring the leaf so aggressively that it was still smoldering when it came to the table.\n           \n\n            Smoke in restaurants is usually found in captivity these days, caged within a glass or a cloche or a bag and carefully liberated, to oohs and aahs, before it drifts toward the ceiling and is gone. This is a favorite modernist party trick that anyone can do with the right smoker and pump. It is kind of cool the first time you see it.\n           \n\n            The smoke rising from the banana-leaf skate was the old, Promethean kind, and if I\u2019m reading its message correctly it signaled another shift in direction for Ssam Bar. Founded by David Chang in the East Village in 2006, the restaurant evolved so quickly in its first two years that it took three New York Times reviews just to keep up.\n           \n\n            In the very beginning, Ssam Bar sold three kinds of Korean burritos. Dana Bowen,\n            \n             writing for The Times\u2019s cheap-eats column,\n            \n            called them \u201cenjoyable enough,\u201d then spent the rest of her space on the after-hours experiments that Mr. Chang and three other cooks were serving late at night, like a whole roasted pork butt, to be pulled apart with tongs that quickly become as joyously greasy as everything and everybody else at the table.\n           \n\n            By early 2007,\n            \n             when Frank Bruni weighed in\n            \n            , the after-hours experiments had taken over the menu, which offered previously unimagined combinations of kimchi, country ham, hamachi, rice sticks, fish sauce and organ meats. Ssam Bar had become \u201ca nearly full-fledged restaurant in near-perfect sync with the times,\u201d Mr. Bruni wrote. Apparently it wasn\u2019t done fledging yet; he returned in 2008 to\n            \n             promote it from two stars to three\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            Review overkill? No. Ssam Bar wasn\u2019t just changing its menu. It rewrote the rules by which critically acclaimed restaurants were supposed to operate, stripping away comforts (chairs with backs, sound systems with a \u201clow\u201d setting) and amenities (reservations, unshared tables), and gambling that everybody would be too stunned by the food to complain.\n           \n\n            It worked. Ssam Bar mounted a guerrilla attack on the dining establishment, and it won before anybody quite knew what was going on, Mr. Chang included.\n           \n\n            There followed a long period of refinement and maturation, which is more than some guerrilla outfits can say. The wine list now takes more than 20 seconds to read, and is especially worth exploring for fans of gamay and sparkling wine. (Or both \u2014 there\u2019s a sparkling gamay.) Under Matthew Rudofker, the executive chef from 2010 until May, Ssam Bar expanded beyond pork shoulder to other sizable cuts of meat: rib-eyes, briskets, whole ducks.\n           \n\n            Over the years, like many of Mr. Chang\u2019s restaurants, Ssam Bar was increasingly infiltrated by modern techniques, fermentation, cutting-edge plating styles and umami-building tricks. The kitchen worked at a very high level, but at times it felt slightly deracinated, as if it drew much of its inspiration from other islands in\n            \n             the Momofuku archipelago\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            Carefully but confidently, Mr. Ng is moving away from that style and toward one of his own. He has gone back to the traditions of Asia, particularly street food and Singaporean cuisine. Like the char on that smoldering banana leaf, his techniques tend to be premodern, even though he has worked for nobody but Mr. Chang since moving to the United States in 2011, starting with an externship at Ssam Bar during culinary school and rising to chef de cuisine at\n            \n             Momofuku Ko\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            Mr. Ng has been trying his hand at the fish-shaped cakes from Japan known as taiyaki. He has a terrific idea for what to do with them: stuff them with foie gras. In his hands they\u2019re almost French, because he fills the molds with croissant dough rather than pancake batter and glazes the crust with honey and white port. Over the top he strews some candied puffed rice that would make a fine breakfast; the whole dish would make a fine breakfast, come to think of it, although you\u2019d stand up afterward knowing your day had already peaked.\n           \n\n            Sizzling eggs arrive not quite set in a cast-iron pan hot enough to finish cooking them at the table. The heat also softens a slice of pork terrine, which melts to coat the eggs. When I first tried this open-faced omelet, the eggs had been poured around a handful of chanterelles. Now they\u2019ve been replaced by smoked bluefish.\n           \n\n            To make one of the most original corn dishes I\u2019ve seen in a long time, Mr. Ng cleaves the cobs lengthwise into quarters and fries them until they curl. They are dusted with spice. You pick one up with your fingers and swipe it through a black aioli of squid ink or a white streak of whipped ricotta, which will melt like butter. Then you eat the kernels from the cob as if you were gnawing the meat off a baby back rib.\n           \n\n            These new dishes live alongside some legacies of Mr. Rudofker\u2019s regime. There are cured sardines on long fingers of toast spread with hozon, the fermented chickpea paste that in this case plays the role of butter very well.\n           \n\n            Big cuts of meat are still offered. They have to be ordered ahead, but a variation of the rotisserie duck can sometimes be had on the spur of the moment. The breast is rubbed heartily with five-spice powder and fanned out over rice, the idea being to wrap it in lettuce with fried shallots and gochujang, without getting too distracted when the duck\u2019s fried bones show up about 15 minutes later.\n           \n\n            As if he had realized that a restaurant that acts like a teenage punk is not as endearing once it reaches middle age, Mr. Chang redid Ssam Bar last year. The seats and bar stools have backs. The communal tables have been replaced by smaller ones where you sit only with people you know. Somehow the noise has been tamed.\n           \n\n            You won\u2019t have tinnitus by the time you get to Mr. Ng\u2019s Singaporean coconut pie, which has a smooth, sweet, wobbly, pandan-scented filling like chess pie, a dome of whipped cream made from coconut milk and a dark brown drizzle of coconut-sugar caramel.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 179, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/dining/momofuku-ssam-bar-review.html", "google_mag": 23.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n            On the first undeniably cold night in November, an idea began to take shape in my head. The shape was specific, and it looked like the map of Austria. As in my grade-school geography books, it was illustrated with images of natural resources: amber waves of Wiener schnitzel, nuggets of goulash the color of iron ore, the gentle white slopes of Salzburger nockerl.\n           \n\n            There is no wrong time of year to eat Austrian food, but the approach of winter always brings it to my mind \u2014 a lifelong habit of associating strudel and schnitzel with snowflakes that stay on your nose and eyelashes, thank you very much, Julie Andrews. So when I first saw that map, I knew what it meant: Time to go back to\n            \n             Walls\u00e9\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            For 17 years, Kurt Gutenbrunner has been serving Austrian cuisine underpinned by farmers\u2019 market produce at Walls\u00e9, in the West Village. It was his first restaurant as chef and owner, the start of a minor Austrian empire that now includes\n            \n             Blaue Gans\n            \n            , where there are more wursts on the menu and more elbows on the tables, and\n            \n             Caf\u00e9 Sabarsky\n            \n            in the Neue Galerie museum, where people sit upright over cups of milchkaffee and slim wedges of Linzer torte.\n           \n\n            Walls\u00e9 is still his base camp, where at the end of the night you might see him towering over the second-tallest person at the bar. Imposing as he is, Mr. Gutenbrunner is dwarfed by his own portrait, which hangs across from the bar. Julian Schnabel painted him looking both heroic and angry, surrounded by a lightning-blue nimbus. The blue light may represent the bolts of inspiration that drive Mr. Gutenbrunner to higher and higher creative peaks, although to me it looked as if he had been soaked with kirsch and flamb\u00e9ed.\n           \n\n            The painting is one of many that have accumulated at Walls\u00e9 over the years. Otherwise, the two small rooms look much as I remembered them from my last visit, around the time of its last review in The New York Times, in 2004, when Amanda Hesser\n            \n             gave it two stars\n            \n            . The windows on West 11th Street are still impressively wide; the tablecloths are still white; the chairs are still black, high-backed and convincingly Secession-ish.\n           \n\n            But furniture was not part of the map that had danced before my eyes. Schnitzel was, and the particular schnitzel I had seen was veal, pounded to the thickness of flannel, inside a rippled crust of crumbs. I wanted to be able to slice it with the side of a fork and hear it crackle. I wanted it with sweet, cool sliced cucumbers, a fingerling potato salad and lingonberries. And that is what I got.\n           \n\n            Another pressing issue: Was quark spaetzle with braised rabbit still on the menu? It was. Would this warm bowl of buttered noodles, in irregular curves and swoops like some secret alphabet, still make me glad I\u2019d walked this far west facing a chilly wind off the river? It did.\n           \n\n            The goulash was not the home-style stew I had pictured \u2014 it was made from short ribs braised separately before being introduced to a paprika-onion sauce \u2014 but it was delicious.\n           \n\n            The fine produce that I remembered as setting Walls\u00e9 apart from more old-school Austrian restaurants was still there, too. Wonderful lobster poached in butter was woven in with small chanterelles and crisp zucchini. Little minarets of romanesco sat alongside the warm smoked char under chopped green apple and trout roe.\n           \n\n            Walls\u00e9\u2019s Sacher torte has a black-gloss icing made from a darker chocolate than usual, and it\u2019s moister than some versions; it doesn\u2019t necessarily need its little quenelle of whipped cream, but of course Sacher torte that is not served mit schlag is not Sacher torte.\n           \n\n            As for the triple-mounded souffl\u00e9 known as Salzburger knockerl, it was better than anything my imagination could have whipped up. Mr. Gutenbrunner\u2019s version looks and tastes like three peach-size toasted marshmallows with small brown peaks, and it sits on a pool of hot dark caramel and huckleberries.\n           \n\n            All these things are just what I want when I go to Walls\u00e9. But other aspects of my recent meals knocked a little of the shine off the enthusiasm I used to feel.\n           \n\n            There were dishes that didn\u2019t come off. The next time I tried the goulash it was a venison stew, and each bite was different. A few were tender, but others were hard, dry or gristly. Raw wild bass, with radishes and black sesame seeds, tasted as if its swimming days were a little too far in the past.\n           \n\n            Savory palatschinken, crepes rolled around smoked trout and horseradish sauce, were fine and lively one night, but on another the cold hand of the refrigerator lay heavily on them. And I tried the Icelandic cod twice without ever learning to like the peculiarly fruity, soupy squash pur\u00eae spooned around the fish.\n           \n\n            Apple strudel fell somewhere between the two extremes. You could certainly pick worse strudels to end the night with, but the pastry was a bit of a nonentity; its flavor almost disappeared into the fruit\u2019s.\n           \n\n            The service seems to have lost the lightly starched Middle-European rectitude that I remembered. Plates were all set down at the same time, but some were cleared before everyone was finished. There are excellent Austrian bottles on the fairly concise wine list, but with prices that easily drift up above $70, you might wish the servers were better versed on their ins and outs. And it shouldn\u2019t be so easy to be ignored in dining rooms as intimate as Walls\u00e9\u2019s.\n           \n\n            It wouldn\u2019t take much to pull the lines taut again. And even with these flaws, Walls\u00e9 has Old World charm and grown-up civility that aren\u2019t easy to find in the younger restaurants that have cropped up nearby.

He would have extended his streak to four courses, I think, had the menu offered a foie gras dessert.\n        \n\n         As it turned out, his appetizer would have worked almost as well as a finale. The Modern\u2019s chef, Gabriel Kreuther, scooped out little balls of duck liver terrine and rolled them in crumbs of fried celery root so they looked like nut-crusted bonbons. These counterfeit candies were set on a rectangle of mango and passion fruit sauce within scribbles of syrupy balsamic vinegar, bringing out an unsuspected kinship between the terrine and ganache.\n        \n\n         In the second course, foie gras was a star protein, poached in red wine. This time its garnishes \u2014 bittersweet chocolate tuile, pickled red currants and a peppery caramel \u2014 worked as foils to show up its seriousness and depth. Then in the third course, it took a step back, serving as a sauce that enriched slices of squab breast baked in savoy cabbage inside a shatteringly thin brik crust.\n        \n\n         The three dishes could have been a monotonous episode in self-indulgence. Instead they were a memorable demonstration of the skill, inventiveness and discipline that permit Mr. Kreuther to make his ingredients do what he wants them to do while still tasting like themselves. Those traits made my recent meals in the Dining Room at the Modern a pleasure and something of a discovery, if one can discover an eight-year-old restaurant run by\n         \n          Danny Meyer\n         \n         inside the\n         \n          Museum of Modern Art\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         When the Dining Room was\n         \n          last reviewed\n         \n         in The New York Times, in 2005, Frank Bruni praised its \u201csignificant joys,\u201d including much of the food, but warned of \u201cuneven terrain\u201d on the menu. At the time, the far more casual and livelier Bar Room up front met its promises more fully, as Mr. Bruni suggested when he awarded that space\n         \n          three stars\n         \n         in a later review, one more than he had given the Dining Room.\n        \n\n         The Bar Room still has more energy, but the cooking in the Dining Room has more focus and intensity than I remember from the early days. Mr. Kreuther\u2019s dishes in this space are more complicated than the more rustic ones in the Bar Room, but the complications pay off in rewarding layers of harmony and contrast.\n        \n\n         Two cured fillets of sardine (one smooth and silver, the other crackling and golden with a thin sheet of brioche seared to its skin) were outfitted with crisp artichoke chips and dots of artichoke pur\u00e9e, but the warm heart of the dish was a bright sauce of tomato confit, black garlic, green olives, roasted red peppers and blood oranges. Eat it and you almost felt the summer sun beating down on your head.\n        \n\n         Other recent dishes invited you to burrow into winter\u2019s consolations. Sweet apple-wood smoke made its way into every bite of a sturgeon and sauerkraut tart topped with a glittering vein of caviar. It was elegant and powerful, like the pairing of a luxuriously soft poached egg with squid-ink spaetzle, sea urchin, roasted salsify and fragments of black truffles.\n        \n\n         The white walls and tablecloths, and the grid of steel and glass facing the museum\u2019s sculpture garden, suggest a contemporary gallery. This graceful, understated room stands back so the artistry can happen on the plate. Mr. Kreuther follows through. He is bold with color, painting salmon crimson with a marinade of beet juice, or drawing a dark green stripe of powdered Kaffir lime down the center of a monkfish fillet resting in a gorgeous sauce of blood orange and mustard.\n        \n\n         He is intrepid with flavor as well. Roasted lobster tail seemed complete with a smoky pimento broth that I would have happily drunk from a teacup, but then a server brought something extra, a tiny portion of tender claw meat under a wheel of burned sugar that went beyond caramel by several degrees of bitterness. It was daring and wonderful.\n        \n\n         One or two dares didn\u2019t pay off, like juxtaposition of pear pur\u00e9e and bay scallops. There were technical glitches, too, like the bottom crust on the sturgeon tart that was crisp one night but damp on another, or the piece of cobia cooked to the point of dryness on one side.\n        \n\n         Yet the next act of each four-course, $98 fixed-price dinner would invariably set things right again. This was especially true for Marc Aumont\u2019s desserts, fresh looks at European classics like a black currant vacherin or a Black Forest cake rendered as an array of cubes, cones and spheres.\n        \n\n         Calling something modern puts it at risk of looking dated, as one or two things at the Modern do. A flurry of amuse-bouches always included a test tube full of hot liquid. Are we still pretending this is a fun way to drink soup? And the charcoal gray suits with collarless shirts the servers wear look like costumes from a sci-fi film about a dystopian, genderless future. The vented jackets in particular don\u2019t do the women any favors.\n        \n\n         As you notice this, though, you also notice just how many women there are in the front of the house, along with others who don\u2019t look like men of European descent. It is a pleasure to see this kind of diversity at the higher altitudes of New York dining, where it is still not the rule.\n        \n\n         The staff was always attentive and mindful, helping diners navigate food allergies, for instance. At moments, though, the service felt disengaged and aloof in ways than can make this formal room feel chillier than it needs to be. (When I heard happy, intoxicated shouts from the Bar Room, I felt as if I\u2019d joined the wrong club.)\n        \n\n         One night, the server driving the mignardise trolley acted as if listing the whole catalog of sweets would make the meal longer than it needed to be, and suggested that she make the choice for us instead. Another night, it was wheeled around by someone who seemed to have been waiting all night for the chance to tell us about the Calvados lollipops, the saffron truffles, the macadamia pralines and the make-your-own sandwich cookies of butter wafers and chocolate ganache in a tube.\n        \n\n         By drawing out the moment, our server made it one to remember. Like the trolley, the restaurant itself is full of unexpected delights. Unpacking them one by one is the pleasant work of a meal.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 181, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-the-dining-room-at-the-modern.html", "google_mag": 26.5}, {"review_text": "\n         When I eat at Kajitsu, a restaurant that practices an animal-free cooking tradition called shojin ryori, I am never shocked to find that I don\u2019t miss meat or fish. When the Japanese have been working on an idea for hundreds of years, they tend to figure out a few things. To express wonder that Kajitsu\u2019s chef, Ryota Ueshima, can fashion a delicious multicourse meal out of nothing but plants and mushrooms is like being astonished when a French baker makes dessert from flour, butter, sugar and eggs.\n        \n\n         But each time I go to\n         \n          Kajitsu\n         \n         , which recently moved from the East Village to a tranquil and luminous new home in Murray Hill, I am still surprised by the variety of flavors that Mr. Ueshima coaxes out of meals that Westerners would call vegan.\n        \n\n         Before reaching across the chef\u2019s counter with porcini and morels cooked in steaming mushroom broth just until they have lost their raw crunch, he adds a ladleful of green sansho buds and blossoms to the bowl. They look like tiny grape clusters, taste a little lemony and make your mouth tingle in a way that intensifies as you eat. The sansho also seems to deepen and change the flavor of the mushrooms until they start to remind you of cured meat.\n        \n\n         On a blanket of Japanese maple leaves, next to a tall cup of spindly enoki mushrooms and a single boiled pearl onion with a red beak of miso, he places a little fried sandwich: two pieces of lotus root filled with house-made fermented tofu. Kajitsu is known for its fermented tofu, and if this strikes you as a sketchy claim to fame, then I urge you to eat some as soon as you can. It has something like the pungent, funky, very deep and long-lasting flavor of blue cheese, with a smoothness of its own.\n        \n\n         Even Mr. Ueshima\u2019s simpler dishes have unexpected depth. A chilled pea soup with a welcome sweetness was underlined by the slight savoriness of white miso. Chopped pine nuts, grated daikon and tender stems of wild parsley scattered over a soupy bowl of rice gave it a fresh, gentle flavor that was like the coming of spring.\n        \n\n         Shojin ryori was developed in Zen Buddhist monasteries after the religion arrived in Japan. The monks did not believe in taking life. They did believe in drinking tea. The frugal meal that preceded their tea ceremony grew into\n         \n          shojin ryori\n         \n         , which grew into the formal multicourse kaiseki tradition. That shojin ryori was vegetarian made it a devotional practice. That it was seasonal went without saying.\n        \n\n         At\n         \n          its original address\n         \n         , Kajitsu may have taken the monastic aesthetic to a fault. The plain walls and chilly stone floors of the dining room were so austere, they felt slightly punitive. The new place (above a shop selling expensive tea and even more expensive teapots) shimmers, although it has not quite gone Vegas.\n        \n\n         In the back is the chef\u2019s counter, carved from a single block of keyaki wood and sitting beneath a gently sloped cedar arch. The front dining room has a bay window and a ceiling that seems to hang in midair. Between the two, casually resting on one side just off the floor, is an 1,800-year-old ceramic pot.\n        \n\n         The service ware at Kajitsu is worth studying. Most pieces are handmade, like the carved wood trays and the hammered metal chopstick rests and sake pitchers. Vintage ceramics with small chips show signs of repair, and their age underlines transience of the seasons that is a major theme of shojin ryori.\n        \n\n         You could design a calendar simply by eating at Kajitsu every four weeks and taking pictures. Mr. Ueshima changes his menus on the first of the month, adding some plants that are at their peak and some that are on the rise. His dishes \u2014 four of them in a $55 tasting, eight in an $85 or $100 menu that ends with a bowl of matcha, green tea as thick and frothy as espresso \u2014 are drawn from the season, but they are also drawings of the season.\n        \n\n         In June, he used a glossy dark magnolia leaf as the lid for a soup of slippery wakame seaweed and sesame tofu fried to a satisfying crunch. Last month, he lay pointy lily blades across a bowl that held a kind of vegan Jell-O salad, a clear gelatin dome studded with slices of raw baby okra, cooked bell peppers and mountain yam. To garnish that pea soup, the first dish on his April menu, he had made tiny replicas of pink-streaked cherry blossoms out of thin sheets of wheat gluten and rice flour, then decorated the bowl with a cherry branch whose flowers were so exquisitely small and delicate that they made other cherry blossoms look like the centerpiece at the wedding of a mobster\u2019s daughter.\n        \n\n         Anticipating the season and showing off local ingredients are both old kaiseki traditions, but I found that the things I enjoyed least at Kajitsu were Western vegetables that had not come into their own yet. Neither grape tomatoes with a vinegar jelly in April nor corn kernels in a golden fritter in June were as lush as they will be in July. And while Mr. Ueshima seems to reach for stronger, meatier flavors than Kajitsu\u2019s first chef, Masato Nishihara, he doesn\u2019t always have his predecessor\u2019s delicacy.\n        \n\n         The chef\u2019s artistry, though, can make up for some of the flavor his ingredients might be missing on their own. His simmered tomato would still be very good in August; it is exceptional in June, a chilled poached plum tomato with slivers of juicy and spicy spring ginger set on shimmering tomato jelly that took its layers of depth from kelp and shiitakes.\n        \n\n         Although the buckwheat flavor of the soba noodles made fresh each day could be a little more full-throated, they are as tender as they could be and still hold together. Rice, the last course before dessert, is a treat that can appear in many forms. Warm and fragrant, sharpened with vinegar, it made a bed for two rows of tender, cooked king oyster mushroom stems carved to look like slices of raw fish. Dab the mushrooms with nori paste and freshly grated wasabi, pinch some rice between chopsticks, and you have a deeply rewarding take on sushi.\n        \n\n         Whether or not it is on your menu, you should drink matcha at the chef\u2019s counter at least once. Mr. Ueshima will froth it with a bamboo whisk before giving the bowl three small turns. Then he sets it in front of you and gives a deep bow that brings you back to the roots of a meal that is more than a meal.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 182, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-kajitsu-in-murray-hill.html", "google_mag": 19.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n            If you love Oaxacan food and live in New York City, it helps to be mobile. About half a million Mexican-Americans live here, too, and while more have been arriving from Oaxaca in recent years, very few have opened restaurants.\n           \n\n            The hunting is better north of town. On a free day, you could head upriver to Poughkeepsie, N.Y., the capital of the Hudson Valley\u2019s Oaxacan community. My own favorite destination until this winter was even farther away, a trim, bright little spot in Kingston called Just For You. Last summer I had a memorable bowl of thick crema de elote and hunks of goat stewed with guajillo chiles. But one of the owners had moved to the United States illegally in 1999 and\n            \n             had recently moved back to Mexico\n            \n            under threat of deportation; the restaurant has closed for now.\n           \n\n            Closer to home, you can make your way to\n            \n             La Morada,\n            \n            in the South Bronx, hoping the elusive\n            \n             mole blanco\n            \n            will be simmering in the kitchen that day, and ready to settle for one of the more easily spotted moles if it is not. You might go to central Brooklyn for the tamal steamed in a banana leaf, or the little fried masa pockets called tetelas, at\n            \n             La Loba Cantina,\n            \n            in Kensington.\n           \n\n            In September, a new choice appeared on Third Avenue in Brooklyn, between the verdant shores of the Gowanus Canal and the foothills of Park Slope. Called\n            \n             Claro\n            \n            , it is run by one of the owners of\n            \n             Freek\u2019s Mill\n            \n            , a nearby restaurant where the servers wear gingham shirts and talk up the virtues of the wine list made up almost entirely of gamay and chenin blanc. His partner is also the chef, T. J. Steele, a veteran of\n            \n             Union Square Cafe\n            \n            and\n            \n             T\u00eda Pol\n            \n            who has the word TACO tattooed on the fingers of his right hand and MASA on those of his left. Those two related themes are continued in ink drawings that run up his arms, across his torso and down to his feet.\n           \n\n            Claro, in other words, is not where you go for Oaxacan recipes that have been passed down from generation to generation. Home-style soups and stews are rare. So is cooked fish. On the other hand, Mr. Steele has given himself liberty to work with ingredients that might furrow the average Mexican grandmother\u2019s brow, like kale and sunchokes. Although he has lived part-time in Oaxaca City for more than a decade, he still thinks like a New York chef.\n           \n\n            But as his head-to-toe artwork suggests, Mr. Steele has a tendency to go all in. This is, as it happens, the only way to make the moles that are the pride of Oaxaca. The moles at Claro are riveting: The ground nuts and dried spices, the garlic and onions all seem to bring out the personalities of the chiles \u2014 sometimes fruity, sometimes vegetal \u2014 while tamping down their heat. He keeps their bitterness in check, too.\n           \n\n            Pork cheek was stewed in a mole rojo that has just enough chocolate to make you smile; the mole negro, in which marbled short ribs were cooked to extreme tenderness, was so balanced that no one ingredient ever seemed to be in the lead. Chichilo, not one of your everyday moles, was the brightest and most outgoing of the three, and a big pool of it made an exciting foil for a chile relleno filled with shredded, spiced duck.\n           \n\n            Mr. Steele also goes all in on masa, which is stone-ground and nixtamalized on site from strains of blue and yellow corn native to Oaxaca. Ten years ago you couldn\u2019t talk about the state of masa in New York without experiencing early signs of depression; now Claro is among a handful of local restaurants whose masa is worth getting excited about.\n           \n\n            It provides the ground floor of about half the things you will eat. Pressed and griddled \u2014 in good weather, this is done outside on a domed comal set over a fire \u2014 the masa becomes the small warm tortillas that are folded into shrimp tacos with an unusually complex chipotle sauce. Larger fried tortillas are the foundation of tostadas, which can be quite the productions here: turkey in salsa with a flicker of heat soothed by crema and mashed avocados; raw yellowfin tuna with blood oranges and puffs of fried pork skin and a whiff of smoke from Oaxacan pasilla chiles.\n            \n\n\n            Thicker, softer wheels of masa with raised rims make up the base of memelas, the Oaxacan version of sopes and huaraches. The one with goat-cheese crema and wild mushrooms has a meaty intensity, without any meat; another, spread with an unexpectedly fluffy hash of chorizo and potatoes, is topped with house-made queso fresco to calm the chorizo\u2019s burn.\n           \n\n            Occasionally, it can be hard to tell Claro\u2019s memelas from its tostadas. Because together they make up a substantial chunk of the menu, if you don\u2019t order carefully you can end up with a long, unbroken run of masa discs. (This is not the worst fate on earth.)\n           \n\n            The flavors at Claro tend to be finely tuned, so when a dish was out of alignment, I noticed. Beef tongue tacos would have needed a heavier glug of salsa to make up for meat that was as salty as country ham. And when the pickled-pepper sauce binding the bacon-and-octopus tostada was too sharp and sour, what had been the high point of one dinner became the low point of another \u2014 a vinegar tostada.\n           \n\n            Claro is filled with evidence of the connections Mr. Steele has made over the years in Oaxaca. The bar stocks a smoky but approachable mezcal that he imports, called El Buho. The tiles under the bar and the charcoal-toned plates and dishes are made by ceramists he met there. It\u2019s all pretty restrained; you don\u2019t get the sense he has turned the restaurant into a warehouse for crafts he bought, drunk on the exchange rate, at the artisan\u2019s market.\n           \n\n            On the wall is a mural of three goats surrounding a woman who seems to be having a bad day; she is in a caldron over a fire, and the goats look hungry. If you want to turn the tables, try to go to Claro on a night when barbecued goat is on the menu. Served with blue and yellow tortillas, red and green salsas, and a bowl of consomm\u00e9, it is more than enough to make a meal of.\n           \n\n            I ate it with one eye on the back door, thinking about what else Claro might serve when the weather is warm enough to start cooking on the wood grill every night.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 183, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/dining/claro-review-brooklyn-oaxacan.html", "google_mag": 22.200000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n            Ever since\n            \n             Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone\n            \n            began rehabilitating chicken Parm and Neapolitan cookies around 2010, I\u2019ve been waiting for other restaurants to carry the torch of Italian-American food boldly into the future. This is a major branch of American cuisine, too important for its fate to be left to the Olive Garden.\n           \n\n            For the most part, though, the torch has gone uncarried. I have been told that\n            \n             Palizzi Social Club,\n            \n            in Philadelphia, may qualify, but because Palizzi is a veritable club \u2014 members and guests only, no new applications accepted \u2014 I don\u2019t expect to eat there before the nation\u2019s tricentennial.\n           \n\n            Then in October, a place opened in the West Village that seemed to hit all the right tropes. It\u2019s called\n            \n             Don Angie\n            \n            . Two chefs share the kitchen \u2014 Angela Rito and her husband, Scott Tacinelli \u2014 and they make versions of\n            \n             chicken scarpariello\n            \n            , antipasto salad and braciole.\n           \n\n            The dining room brings back the high-glitz Italian restaurant d\u00e9cor of the 1970s and \u201980s, the period when Formica and oil paintings of the Bay of Naples went out and mirrors with gold pinstripes came in. The floor is a black-and-white checkerboard. The bar is made of polished marble the color of beef carpaccio. There is a house Chianti, and it comes in a straw-covered bottle. There is hope for a red-sauce renaissance, after all.\n           \n\n            Unfortunately, more or less from the day it opened, having dinner at Don Angie has been only marginally less difficult than eating at a private club. That has something to do with Ms. Rito\u2019s and Mr. Tacinelli\u2019s knack for cooking things that Instagram can\u2019t resist. The two spent three years running the kitchen at\n            \n             Quality Italian\n            \n            in Midtown, where they engineered, among other pieces of shutterbait, a chicken Parm that looked like a pizza. There was some wonderful stuff at Quality Italian and some less wonderful stuff, and almost all of it either arrived on trolleys or was prepared at tableside or set on fire while you watched.\n           \n\n            The restaurant group behind Quality Italian,\n            \n             Quality Branded\n            \n            , is also backing Don Angie. So as I resigned myself to eating at Don Angie close to 5:30 p.m., when I managed to get an unreserved table, I also braced for a dose of abracadabra.\n           \n\n            It arrived right on schedule with my first drink, which a server strained into a glass through a coffee filter cone lined with espresso ice. It was called Americano, Americano, and combined at least three meanings of the word: a highball, an Italian aperitif wine and a diluted shot of espresso. The Americano highball, so simple that just about any bartender can make it, doesn\u2019t need much improvement.\n           \n\n            But I have to admit that the coffee did give it some ballast. I\u2019m also happy to report that this was one of the last bits of stagecraft I saw at Don Angie. Ms. Rito and Mr. Tacinelli have a few tricks up their sleeves, but they save them for the kitchen. The result is food that is creative in a more interesting and more consistently successful way than it was at Quality Italian.\n           \n\n            And it arrives at the table without the aid of trolleys. When you get a Caesar salad, the server doesn\u2019t whip together the dressing on the spot. It\u2019s been done in the kitchen, where the chefs replaced romaine with tender chrysanthemum leaves that taste like some newly discovered herb. (The feathery leaves firmly grip the dressing and the fluffy rasped cheese, too.)\n           \n\n            I can\u2019t remember seeing chrysanthemum in an Italian restaurant before, and it shows the chefs\u2019 skill for cross-pollinating with other cuisines, especially Asian ones. While the Torrisi-Carbone axis is generally faithful to Italian-American standards, using more expensive ingredients and more modern techniques but leaving the basic ideas intact, the Rito-Tacinelli approach is more radical.\n           \n\n            They trample on tradition when they feel like it. Prosciutto and honeydew melon are tossed with candied hazelnuts and mint leaves in a lime, tamarind and fish-sauce dressing. This very good salad, which obviously glances toward Southeast Asia, is a smart way to handle an antipasto standby that is usually pointless except when melons are in season.\n           \n\n            Their garlic bread turns out to be a very thin disc with garlic chives and melted cheese inside and sesame seeds on top. Lightweight, salty and irresistible, it\u2019s modeled on Ligurian focaccia di recco, but it may also bring to mind Turkish gozleme, Azeri kutab or even a Chinese scallion pancake.\n           \n\n            There\u2019s China again, in the pepperoni fried rice served under barbecued squid. Ignore the squid unless you like it leathery, and just focus on the rice, stirring it with labneh when the heat starts to rise.\n           \n\n            The dish everybody has seen on Instagram is the pasta called caramelle. In Italian it means caramel, as in candy, but the shape will remind most Americans of an elongated Tootsie Roll, with twists at either end of a drum that\u2019s filled with buffalo ricotta. Cameras come out because the dough is striped, with black sesame-flour bands alternating with ordinary egg pasta. The sesame barely registers; the fun of the dish is the sauce, a peppered, pickled cantaloupe that tastes like it\u2019s still percolating.\n           \n\n            But the dish that could be Don Angie\u2019s lasting contribution to the pasta sciences is the garganelli with meatball rag\u00f9. The central problem of red-sauce restaurants is this: Pasta and meatballs are always served together, but they remain stubbornly separate. Ms. Rito and Mr. Tacinelli have found a way out of this conundrum by crushing meatballs into a tomato-guanciale rag\u00f9. It\u2019s not quite as simple as I\u2019ve made it sound, but you don\u2019t know that when you\u2019re eating it; you just think you\u2019re magically eating meatballs and pasta at the same time.\n           \n\n            They\u2019ve also tried to salvage chicken scarpariello, a dish that is almost always overcooked. Their solution is to make a kind of pie with chicken meat pressed down into a kind of crust made of sausage. The flavors are accurate, and for once it\u2019s not dry, but it\u2019s not as engaging as other main courses, like the veal cutlet with speck and pickled mustard seeds, or the grilled fillet of orata next to herbed fregola, with buttermilk as the sauce.\n           \n\n            Reworking tiramis\u00f9 almost never improves it, but as a change of pace I did like how the one at Don Angie shifted the emphasis from espresso to bittersweet cocoa. There\u2019s a delicious, if more conventional, plate of tender, light zeppole with tangy whipped robiola under an Andy Warhol mop of spun sugar that people go wild for.\n           \n\n            I was charmed by a smaller, quieter dessert: a mochi cake stuffed with fior di latte ice cream, with sea salt and a fragrant scribble of olive oil. It\u2019s like eating a mozzarella ball that wanted to become a dessert when it grew up, and did.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 185, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/dining/don-angie-review.html", "google_mag": 27.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n         On April Fools\u2019 Day 2008, a former music publicist and retired dominatrix named Erin Norris signed the lease on a derelict\n         \n\n\n          Brooklyn\n         \n         storefront where she intended to open a sausage restaurant called\n         \n          Grindhaus\n         \n         . Almost immediately, the universe began sending her a message: don\u2019t.\n        \n\n         The space had structural weaknesses, and propping it up would become a long, expensive project. Gas burners would not be an option. Nor would the grinding and stuffing of sausages in bulk; as it turned out, there wasn\u2019t enough room. Ms. Norris ran out of money, raised more, blew through that, scraped up a little extra, spent it on the best kitchen equipment she could afford, and announced that she would open soon. The universe, surmising that the message wasn\u2019t getting through, sent a flood. The night of\n         \n\n\n          Hurricane Sandy\n         \n         ,\n         \n          water filled the streets of Red Hook\n         \n         and filled Grindhaus, too, wrecking all that kitchen equipment.\n        \n\n         By this point, the signs had to be clear. Evidently Ms. Norris didn\u2019t care, because she mucked the place out, banged in new, mold-free walls, began a\n         \n          Kickstarter campaign\n         \n         to fund repairs and fresh equipment, and hired Aaron Taber, a chef she had met at the dog run.\n        \n\n         The 20-seat restaurant she opened last December, without the sausage theme, is still called Grindhaus. This may be a sign of Ms. Norris\u2019s stubbornness, or it may show that she grasps a basic principle of business: When you have a restaurant name that suggests a lost\n         \n          Russ Meyer\n         \n         film set in a German wurst hall staffed by karate-kicking supervixens who are barely contained by their black-leather dirndls, you don\u2019t give it up because you can\u2019t serve sausages.\n        \n\n         Grindhaus is not entirely sausage-free. I did eat a few pinches of fresh merguez there once. It was terrific stuff, rich and spicy, folded inside fresh cappellacci. Around these pasta bundles, Mr. Taber had set a snake-curve of charred scallion, confidently seasoned chickpeas and yogurt for a sauce. There were also balls of chickpea cakes called panisses. Panisses may not seem to go with pasta, but these were good enough to go with any dish they wanted.\n        \n\n         In his short cooking career, Mr. Taber has worked at\n         \n          the Pines\n         \n         in Brooklyn and made dough for a mobile pizza oven. At Grindhaus, his first post as chef, he cooks alone in a kitchen almost exactly the dimensions of the restroom. He makes the kind of earnest, fashionably austere, handsomely arranged food that is signified on menus by sans-serif lists of ingredients, with no capital letters, verbs, articles or hint of how one thing may relate to the next. In some restaurants, they don\u2019t relate. At Grindhaus, they do.\n        \n\n         The first thing I ate there was written this way:\n        \n\n\n          rutabaga\n         \n\n\n         carrot, sorrel, grapefruit\n        \n\n         Was it a salad? A soup? A purgative juice blend? No. It was a delicious and ingeniously simple vegetable tart. A buttery pie shell was just big enough to contain a thick, soft wheel of rutabaga held in place by a layer of pur\u00e9ed carrots. The lemonlike bite of raw sorrel and the true citrus of grapefruit acted as welcome rays of sunlight breaking into this ode to the root cellar.\n        \n\n         Mr. Taber\u2019s style of cooking is often found in druidic, wood-filled restaurants with tasting menus, cupboards stacked with hand-thrown pottery and painfully earnest names derived from natural materials, like Resin. Grindhaus isn\u2019t as high-minded as those places. It has some rock \u2019n\u2019 roll in its trousers.\n        \n\n         A steel silhouette of a broken wine glass hangs in the front window, and the jagged shards attached to the stem look like the fingers of a hand raised in a heavy-metal salute. The framed sketches of the heads of Keith Moon and Brian Jones were drawn in high school by a friend of Ms. Norris\u2019s whose later work, under the name Cynthia Plaster Caster, would depict other regions of rock-star anatomy.\n        \n\n         On the bar is the stuffed head of a white horse, its gaping mouth now a vase for eucalyptus branches. Like most things in Grindhaus, the head has a story. It was made to Ms. Norris\u2019s specifications by a taxidermist who waited three years for a dead horse in the right color to come along. \u201cThe throat was to open up so it could have a lot of ephemera and antique drug paraphernalia, prescriptions from the 19th century,\u201d Ms. Norris said.\n        \n\n         Even if you never figure out what\u2019s in the horse\u2019s throat, the head with its flowing mane still works its spell as part of Grindhaus\u2019s invitation to let it loose and come on down. It\u2019s not a rowdy place, but it is one where classic rock may play all night. It\u2019s a place where I felt quite at ease singing along to\n         \n          \u201cVolunteers\u201d\n         \n         while tearing off a fistful of sourdough bread, which Mr. Taber bakes inside a cast-iron pot to give it a crust that is as stiff, crisp and dark as bread crust can get without being burned. It\u2019s a place where certain flavors, like the seared foie gras with ripe strawberries in warm strawberry-rhubarb juice, or the duck breast with morels and rye berries, were so intense that I called over the server and asked for the same dish again, please, before another course left the kitchen.\n        \n\n         Ms. Norris buys the wines. Almost all come from the natural school, and a few were chosen with more enthusiasm than discernment, so it\u2019s wise to taste before committing to a bottle. As they are all poured by the glass, this is easy to do.\n        \n\n         Wines that didn\u2019t seem quite ready and a slightly undercooked monkfish were the only tastes I regretted. I could also wish for more than one dessert on the menu. Recently it was a chocolate mousse with a caramel-like strawberry cream, cacao nibs and puffed rice; I liked it just fine, but the people at my table who didn\u2019t would have appreciated an alternative. Mr. Taber, no doubt, would appreciate a bigger kitchen and someone to share it with.\n        \n\n         Like the romance in a screwball comedy, though, Grindhaus gets its energy from the meeting of opposites: Mr. Taber\u2019s large ambitions and his tiny work space, the carefully considered cooking and Ms. Norris\u2019s wild paraphernalia. She hasn\u2019t decorated the place with canes or masks from her dominatrix days, but she believes the dungeon helped shape Grindhaus.\n        \n\n         \u201cThat\u2019s also the hospitality industry, in a way,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cSo it finds its way into how things are run and taking care of people. Making sure no one leaves scarred. Or unhappy.\u201d\n        \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 186, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/dining/restaurant-review-grindhaus-in-red-hook-brooklyn.html", "google_mag": 23.600000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n         The steakhouse is in trouble. Not financial trouble, because new ones keep opening, but spiritual trouble. Its soul is unwell. Because many other restaurants now offer better beef, the steakhouse serves little purpose except as a stage set for the dwindling number of occasions that require men to bond by spending money and consuming red meat together.\n        \n\n         Sensing that it has lost its swagger, chefs have tried to revive the genre by applying their culinary-school training. Their knifework is geometric, their potato recipes are French, their menus prettified with appetizers like diced raw bluefin under droplets of Ligurian olive oil. Each dish may be a delight on its own terms, but the whole approach is wrong. Trying to save the steakhouse by adding sashimi is like trying to improve a martial arts movie by casting\n         \n\n\n          Gwyneth Paltrow\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         We all know that there\u2019s a problem, but only Hugue Dufour and Sarah Obraitis seem to have any idea how to fix it. Husband and wife, chef and manager, the two came to New York a few years ago and began waging a merciless attack on all that is fastidious and fussy in modern dining. First was the 18-month run of\n         \n          their gonzo diner\n         \n         , and then\n         \n          their \u201cdinette\u201d inside MoMA PS 1\n         \n         . Their most recent assault on propriety is M. Wells Steakhouse, which opened in November in a converted auto-body shop in Long Island City,\n         \n\n\n          Queens\n         \n         .\n        \n\n\n          M. Wells Steakhouse\n         \n         needs some fixing itself. Discipline is not its strong suit, for better and for worse. It can lurch from magnificence to sloppiness, from inspired\n         \n\n\n          fever\n         \n         dreams to inarticulate notions that aren\u2019t ready to leave the kitchen. One thing that needs improvement is the steak. This isn\u2019t as fatal as you\u2019d think, because when M. Wells Steakhouse succeeds, it does so in a deeply satisfying fashion, by feeding the lust in your gut for a meal that is not just a dinner but a feast.\n        \n\n         Mr. Dufour and Ms. Obraitis get this. They know that we go to steakhouses to feel more alive. They respond appropriately, even if that sometimes means feeding us enough to kill us.\n        \n\n         Let other chefs precisely engineer 130-degree steaks with immersion circulators and digital thermometers. Mr. Dufour has gone back to the cave, grilling meats over a crackling wood fire. This makes the steaks smoky, of course, and a little uneven, slightly overdone in spots, the meat seasoned with the scorch of burning fat. It\u2019s an imperfect steak, and those imperfections are just the kind of the premodern thrill that makes a traditional steakhouse great.\n        \n\n         When we go to a steakhouse, we want to wrestle with our own appetites, to learn their exact dimensions. Luckily, confrontational portions are the way Mr. Dufour signs his name. I have eaten whole tasting menus that were less filling than the appetizers at M. Wells Steakhouse. French onion soup is more solid than liquid, stuffed with poached pork belly and a marrow bone (tiny spoon provided) that takes the natural beefiness of onion broth to its logical conclusion.\n        \n\n         Solomon Gundy, a dish that takes pickled smelts as its starting point, adds half a potato waffle, a huge outcropping of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and a landslide of intensely crunchy trout eggs. If winter is getting you down, I\u2019d prescribe one Solomon Gundy, to be taken at the bar with a glass of Champagne. (\u00c9tienne Gu\u00e9rin, imported from\n         \n\n\n          Montreal\n         \n         to be the wine director, has built a winningly nondogmatic list that is mostly French but doesn\u2019t turn up its nose at a well-made retsina.)\n        \n\n         Less photogenic but just as wonderful are the sweetbreads blanquette in an unnervingly delicious expanse of white sauce. The blanquette is also offered as a side dish, but only the appetizer version is served on a plateful of mashed potatoes.\n        \n\n         There are two very good salads as well. Do not be na\u00efve enough, however, to think that you will be eating lightly by ordering the romaine Caesar under a heap of grated Parmesan, as fluffy and white as the frosting on a coconut cake, or the improbably crisp grilled iceberg wedge in a blue cheese dressing speckled with bacon and candied pecans.\n        \n\n         Ready for your pork chop tower? Here come a half-dozen thin-cut grilled chops piled up, with a salty pat of anchovy butter between each one, as if it were a stack of pancakes. It\u2019s deranged and wonderful.\n        \n\n         With other main courses, though, we have to face the unpleasant reality that dinner at M. Wells Steakhouse can at times resemble \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u201d, that all this heroic swaggering comes with a certain amount of swaying and weaving and stumbling over the furniture, gastronomically speaking.\n        \n\n         A Moroccan tagine with soft hunks of full-flavored lamb was as sweet as Jell-O salad. A torpedolike lobster roll tasted of its bun, and not much else. In the caviar sandwich, the pop and brine of what must have been a fat helping of sturgeon roe from\n         \n\n\n          Florida\n         \n         were muffled between two fried planks of\n         \n\n\n          Texas\n         \n         -toast-size bread. I kept thinking of what I could have done with that much caviar, or the $50 I\u2019d just spent.\n        \n\n         I wasn\u2019t much happier paying $17 for the bone-in burger, a dense bundle of ground beef on the very low end of the juiciness and tenderness scales. The dish, with a swoosh of bone jutting out from within the bun, is a hit on\n         \n\n\n          Instagram\n         \n         . Too bad I couldn\u2019t feed it to my camera.\n        \n\n         The skin of the trout au bleu, netted from a tank in the kitchen, conked on the skull with firewood, gutted and slipped into a tangy court bouillon, is meant to turn blue, eponymously. Does it, though? Hard to tell, because it was always covered up by fingerling potatoes, cabbage and tartar sauce. The flavor and feel of the trout seemed terrific, but with so many things competing for attention, that was hard to tell, too.\n        \n\n         And while the fire does great things to the steaks, the meat didn\u2019t always live up to it. The grass-fed Kansas City strip was all elastic muscle and very little flavor. The somewhat retiring chateaubriand needed the help of a sauce, but sauces are sold separately, and nobody offered us one.\n        \n\n         The best steak I ate at M. Wells Steakhouse came from a neighbor\u2019s tomahawk chop, grilled on a whole rib almost the size of a goalie\u2019s stick. It could have served six, so we bartered for a taste. The meat gushed with juices and shiny, delicious fat.\n        \n\n         M. Wells Steakhouse was in the works for about two years. Still, I sometimes got the sense that Ms. Obraitis and Mr. Dufour are making it up as they go along. They wanted a dessert cart but decided to keep it stationary, requiring customers to walk over to it to select one of Bethany Costello\u2019s sweets. (I can save you the trip: Get the tall pile of cheesecake or the Paris-Brest, which crackles with scraps of hazelnut brittle.)\n        \n\n         It\u2019s a crazy way to run a restaurant. And if Mr. Dufour can fix the trout dish and find a steak that has the tomahawk chop\u2019s intensity for less than $200, I hope it stays that way. A great steakhouse should make you feel a little insane.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 189, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/dining/restaurant-review-m-wells-steakhouse-in-long-island-city-queens.html", "google_mag": 31.700000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n         Nobody goes to Rome for the pizza.

For the last five years Mr. Anderer has been a faithful custodian of the more famous Roman landmarks at\n         \n          Maialino\n         \n         , in the Gramercy Park Hotel.\n         \n\n\n          Marta\n         \n         , opened in September, is a continuation of that project, a spinoff that might have found a space next door if\n         \n\n\n          Danny Meyer\n         \n         \u2019s\n         \n          Union Square Hospitality Group\n         \n         had not decided to place it about a half-mile away in the soaring, stately lobby of the Martha Washington Hotel.

Thin-crust pies are wall to wall around here. It is the house style of New York, a city to which people actually do travel for pizza. The style came from\n         \n\n\n          Naples\n         \n         with America\u2019s earliest pizzaioli more than a century ago, and it\u2019s been rejuvenated by modern obsessives who precisely calibrate their flour blends. What do we have to learn from Rome?\n        \n\n         Let\u2019s keep local pride in check for a minute. Marta\u2019s crusts are even thinner than what we think of as thin. Cooks in gray baseball caps press the dough flat with rolling pins on a marble counter. Slipped onto the floor of one of the hulking ovens whose black-tiled chimneys disappear into the hotel\u2019s second floor, the pies bake next to flickering stacks of firewood.\n        \n\n         The crust at first-rank Roman pizzerias like Da Remo in Testaccio is often compared to a cracker, but crackers crumble. This doesn\u2019t. It is more like the crust on a loaf of peasant bread from which all the soft crumbs have been stripped. It is durably crisp, unbendingly flat, and when you hold a slice by the edge, the rest of it juts out above the table like a cliff. Because everything I know about cliffs was learned from Wile E. Coyote, I kept waiting for the tip on each Marta slice to give way, but it never did.\n        \n\n         The pleasure of biting down on this pizza is both physical and auditory. The noise detonates along the jaw and plows right into the inner ear. Every bite sounds and feels like that. There is no soupy middle of steamed dough under wet tomatoes. It\u2019s pure crunch, all the way. What you lose with this style is the soft, springy, baguette-like curls at the edges of a Neapolitan pizza. The outer crusts of a Marta pie don\u2019t puff up; they stay hard and round, like grissini.\n        \n\n         When a pizza crust is all crackle, what\u2019s on top has to bring the flavor. This is where you see Mr. Anderer thinking like a cook. He has a great pizza-fied version of carbonara, with dots of egg and grated pecorino over crumbled, starchy potatoes and baconlike curls of guanciale. For a while, he was doing an enjoyable two-dimensional trippa alla Romana, too, spreading the rich, chile-boosted tomato sauce around the pie and arranging tender, not too chewy bands of tripe on top.\n        \n\n         In a more classical vein, the margherita, spread with flavorful tomatoes that are more pulp than sauce and punctuated with mozzarella, is superb. At $16, the buffalo mozzarella, richer and with a faint taste of the barnyard or wherever it is water buffaloes pass the time, is worth the $4 upgrade from the cow\u2019s milk variety.\n        \n\n         And if $18 seems high for a funghi pizza, note that the funghi in question are quartered chanterelles and frilly hen-of-the-woods, seasoned with thyme and just enough salt. Like almost all the toppings, the mushrooms are beautifully cooked with an insinuation of smoke; only the shoulder ham, layered between fontina and arugula, seemed to want more time in the oven, or maybe it needed to be sliced thin, so the edges could crisp and curl.\n        \n\n         Few pizzerias invest heavily in atmospherics, because pizza and the people who love it come and go in a few minutes. Still, it\u2019s a surprise just how little atmosphere the Union Square Hospitality Group has tried to conjure at Marta. The dining room, with its majestic high ceilings and blocky fluted columns, has the cold, empty monumentality of a 19th-century bank. There\u2019s some energy at the counter that faces the ovens, but very little in the rows of square tables behind it. The restaurant is open to the hotel lobby, and after a while, the comings and goings can make you feel as if you\u2019re eating in the waiting room of a train station.\n        \n\n         Lingering over a long series of courses is not advised. Marta works best when treated as a pizzeria, not a restaurant. Main courses are available, but they are not as trustworthy as the pies. Pork ribs managed to be both charred and undercooked, while a slow-roasted short rib needed a more potent infusion of flavor than gremolata could give it. The mixed grill of lamb chops, ribs and sausage was a magnificent exception, but in general the larger plates are best for those who can\u2019t eat pizza. (Marta does not make gluten-free dough.)\n        \n\n         A quick appetizer while the pizza bakes is absolutely recommended, though. Wood smoke wraps around rabbit meatballs, heavily peppered and herbed. The kitchen does fine work with hot oil, swathing vegetable fritters or seafood fritto misto in a translucently thin, light-gold batter and gently browning the bread crumbs around green suppl\u00ec shaped from very good basil risotto.\n        \n\n         After pizza, there is an affogato that is exactly right, an ice cream sandwich that\u2019s harder to like than it should be (the salted chocolate cookies could be thinner or softer, the pistachios crisper) and a cup of tiramis\u00f9 that\u2019s bracingly drenched in espresso. It costs just $5, which is helpful because pizza and fried food both need bubbles. Marta has a few Italian sparkling wines, but the real action is in the stockpile of nearly 40 Champagnes, from a $66 Roger Pouillon Cuv\u00e9e de R\u00e9serve to some $300-plus vintage treats. Nobody goes to Rome for Champagne with pizza, either, but this isn\u2019t Rome.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 191, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/03/dining/restaurant-review-danny-meyers-marta-in-nomad.html", "google_mag": 25.5}, {"review_text": "\n         If you hooked a seismograph to\n         \n\n\n          Danny Meyer\n         \n         \u2019s Union Square Hospitality Group, the readout for most of the last two decades would be boringly predictable. Regular spikes would indicate the orderly arrival of restaurants, with just a few aberrant tremors here and there: the closure of Tabla and, very rarely, a change of chef.\n        \n\n         But since the summer of 2013, one quake after another has jolted the needle. The chef of the Dining Room and the Bar Room at the Modern stepped down. Then the same thing happened at the two Blue Smoke locations. Then North End Grill. One at a time, replacements were named. Recently came word that when Untitled moves downtown with the\n         \n\n\n          Whitney Museum of American Art\n         \n         , it will get a new chef, too.\n        \n\n         This cluster of seismic activity could be a coincidence. Or it could mean that pressure was building for a while; suddenly, the tectonic plates moved. What is clear is that a company with a healthy respect for loyalty and stability has taken advantage of the turnover. The new chefs are far from cautious caretakers; they\u2019ve moved decisively to refresh menus that, in some cases, had begun to stagnate.\n        \n\n         Today I\u2019ll take on Blue Smoke and North End Grill;\n         \n\n\n          the Modern\n         \n         is a complicated case of two restaurants, each holding three stars from\n         \n\n\n          The New York Times\n         \n         , and is best saved for another time.\n        \n\n         Even fans of Blue Smoke would not have described it, before Jean-Paul Bourgeois took over the kitchen last March, as a beacon of innovation. From its birth in 2002 on East 27th Street through the opening of a Battery Park City location 10 years later, Blue Smoke tried to replicate every major American barbecue style. This guaranteed that its meat would be compared to\n         \n\n\n          Texas\n         \n         brisket, Carolina pulled pork and\n         \n\n\n          St. Louis\n         \n         ribs, and also guaranteed that the verdict would not favor Blue Smoke.\n        \n\n         Mr. Bourgeois has tried to extract himself from that trap by dropping the regional aspirations from the menu, which now offers \u201cseven-pepper rubbed beef brisket\u201d and so on. It\u2019s a start, but today Blue Smoke also faces competition from local pitmasters who produce great barbecue more consistently than it does. At their best, Blue Smoke\u2019s pulled pork can run a close second to the one at Mighty Quinn\u2019s Barbeque, and the brisket isn\u2019t far off the one at Hometown Bar-B-Que, which has gotten better and better. On off days, you may get a pulp of gray, lifeless, smokeless pork or a tough, stringy sparerib. But while Blue Smoke\u2019s barbecue lags, as ever, a few paces behind the front-runners, when it comes to contemporary Southern cooking in New York Mr. Bourgeois\u2019s menu is at the head of the pack.\n        \n\n         An appetizer called the Preservation Plate recently gave a survey of his range. He had used the smoker to turn a duck breast into very fine ham. His kitchen had put up pickles in the warm weather, string beans and red grapes tasting of cloves. He\u2019d made a blackberry and root beer mustard to go with chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 on toast, and tender, juicy pickled shrimp. This is a platter that summons thoughts of Frank Stitt or Hugh Acheson.\n        \n\n         Mr. Bourgeois is a native of Thibodaux, La., and some of his best dishes have been yanked, still wriggling, right out of the bayou. You know he means to do things the right way when you see the soft French bread that comes with oysters roasted in smoked garlic butter under crackling bread crumbs. His seafood boil is outstanding, every ingredient cooked the way it should be: the little potatoes, the crisp baby carrots, the fat, wonderful gulf shrimp and a head of boiled garlic that is delicious spread on Saltines. The comeback sauce goes with all of it, just as the chunky and aromatic tomato sauce goes with the very fresh pan-seared red snapper, gulf shrimp and crab meat to make a Cajun court bouillon, or coo-bee-yon.\n        \n\n         Over two visits at each location, it became clear that missteps can occur at either, although the worst service I\u2019ve ever had at one of Mr. Meyer\u2019s restaurants took place in the Flatiron branch. My table repeatedly seemed to disappear for 20 minutes at a time. After one long absence, our server seemed to think we should have been finishing our desserts. \u201cHow are your ...\u201d he began. \u201cOh, you still have your menus.\u201d\n        \n\n         Blue Smoke\u2019s desserts themselves seemed to have dropped behind a fog of oblivion until very recently. Two months ago, banana cream pie had lost its custard or pastry cream, so scraps of brown banana sat naked on a pie shell; the kitchen tried in vain to hide them under whipped cream. Late last year the pastry chef Emily Isaac rode in to the rescue, and while she is only beginning to introduce her own desserts, the recipes she inherited are already greatly improved.\n        \n\n         It\u2019s less clear that North End Grill needed a course correction. I gave the restaurant two stars in 2012, but even then I thought Floyd Cardoz\u2019s menu was hard to pin down: It had an egg section, but also lots of fish, and meat cooked on the wood grill seemed to be important, too.\n        \n\n         Eric Korsh, who started last spring, has a more unified approach, one tilting toward\n         \n\n\n          France\n         \n         . The level of cooking may not be different now, but Mr. Korsh hits more high notes, and hits them more often.\n        \n\n         His charcuterie is worth a visit all by itself, whether for the slippery, salty and gelatinous torchon of trotters or the thin slices of lightly pickled beef tongue with gribiche sauce, tangy and smooth. And he served a loup de mer the way I\u2019d like to see it done at La Grenouille, with a terrific lobster sauce, a tangle of simple spinach and a huge glittering knob of caviar.\n        \n\n         I loved the way Mr. Korsh had seared and deeply scored the skin side of a raw Spanish mackerel, leaving intact the rest of the slab; to lighten the oily fish he had brought together pink grapefruit, hot chiles, cucumber and radishes. I admired how precisely each piece of seafood in his bouillabaisse was cooked, although I thought the broth tasted a little too much like clams. And he seems to get the most out of the wood grill. Smoke and char bring a primeval thrill to a splayed-open, nearly rare squab; now that I think about it again, my pulse is racing. And the Berkshire pork, said to serve two but enough to subdue at least four, is a piece of meat for the ages; it could do for the pork chop what Peter Luger did for the porterhouse.\n        \n\n         Desserts, now by Tracy Obolsky, still weave sophisticated threads into classics, like chocolate cake with crunchy malt or the tribute, in ice cream, to the Almond Joy. Try it, even if you think the original can\u2019t be improved. Change is good.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 192, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/dining/restaurant-review-blue-smoke-and-north-end-grill.html", "google_mag": 27.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n         The revolution ran on grits, ham hocks, ribs, black-eyed peas and biscuits.\n        \n\n         When he opened Minton\u2019s Playhouse in\n         \n\n\n          Harlem\n         \n         in 1940, Henry Minton, the first black delegate to the local musicians\u2019 union, knew that jazz players were frequently in need of a meal and a place to give their instruments a workout. He gave them both. Minton\u2019s extended a tricky welcome to its jam sessions: Musicians could eat free soul food and take a solo as long as they could keep up with the house band, anchored by\n         \n\n\n          Thelonious Monk\n         \n         and Kenny Clarke. (The house band!) This gang of nonconformists delighted in bizarre chord progressions, obscure keys and melodies that ran upside down.\n        \n\n         Their bucking-bronco tactics threw some musicians right off the stage. The ones who stayed put included\n         \n\n\n          Dizzy Gillespie\n         \n         , Coleman Hawkins, Don Byas, a Juilliard student named\n         \n\n\n          Miles Davis\n         \n         and\n         \n\n\n          Charlie Parker\n         \n         , who had a notable ability to put away fried chicken. Writing in Esquire years later,\n         \n\n\n          Ralph Ellison\n         \n         described Minton\u2019s Playhouse as \u201c\n         \n          a musical dueling ground\n         \n         ,\u201d and quoted a bartender who remembered when \u201cLester Young and Ben Webster used to tie up in battle like dogs in the road.\u201d The radical sounds that came out of the duels at Minton\u2019s and a few other clubs made a sharp break with the swing of the big-band era and formed a new style that would be called bebop.\n        \n\n         When assessing the role that Henry Minton\u2019s soul food played in the birth of bebop, it is worth keeping in mind that most of the testimonials to it come to us from hungry jazz musicians whose meals were on the house. Still, African-American music and cooking were a potent mix at Minton\u2019s once, and this was one reason to pay attention to\n         \n          the revival of Minton\u2019s\n         \n         as\n         \n          a jazz supper club\n         \n         that opened 18 months ago.\n        \n\n         Another reason came along in November, when Joseph Johnson, known as J J, took over as chef de cuisine after making a name for himself at Minton\u2019s sister restaurant next door,\n         \n          the Cecil\n         \n         . And a third, highly compelling reason takes the form of Mr. Johnson\u2019s Lowcountry gumbo.\n        \n\n         At the bottom of the bowl are broken grains of Carolina rice, with its irreplaceable flavor. The meat is smoked chicken and the seafood is wild shrimp, as tender and sweet as you could hope for. Two shrimp lie on top, crisscrossed, and their heads are still on. The base that holds it all together tastes of shellfish and tomato, of course, but a deep, mysterious oceanic note lurks down there. It comes from dried shrimp, and it makes for a haunting bowl of gumbo.\n        \n\n         Mr. Johnson does some bold, original cooking at Minton\u2019s. There are also dishes, particularly some appetizers, that could use more verve, and others that can go seriously out of tune when the kitchen has an off night. In the face of that unpredictability, the success of dinner at Minton\u2019s depends on how much you like to hear jazz musicians skittering around a tune, toying with a rhythm, tying and untying knots of harmony.\n        \n\n         If your ears don\u2019t bend that way, you have no business paying the cover charge at Minton\u2019s. If they do, I don\u2019t know a better place in the city to get them reshaped while you eat. The place is extremely welcoming, and manages an old-fashioned graciousness without strain. A dress code for men urges but doesn\u2019t positively demand jackets; the website boils the advice down to three words:\n         \n          \u201cDress Sharp Gents.\u201d\n         \n\n\n         No customer outsharps the front of the house, though. Male servers wear black bow ties and vests, while the managerial types favor tailored suits and pocket squares. One of these, spotting a recently drained cocktail glass on our table, stopped short in mock indignation. \u201cThis is empty. This is an outrage!\u201d he said, and came back in a minute with a freshly mixed drink.\n        \n\n         The tables are lined up along walls hung with cocoa-toned curtains and framed photographs of\n         \n\n\n          Billie Holiday\n         \n         and other innovators, in black and white. At one end of the room are the stage and the only item from the original Minton\u2019s that wasn\u2019t ruined by water used to put out a fire upstairs decades ago: a 1948 mural of a late-night jam session in a small bedroom lighted by a\n         \n\n\n          kerosene\n         \n         lamp. On the brass bed, a woman in a red dress has passed out, face down.\n        \n\n         If she ever comes to, she may want to fortify herself with a plate of warm biscuits and whipped butter sweetened with sorghum and vanilla. Or, if she\u2019s lucky, the kitchen will send out some hush puppies, with black-eyed peas and pickled okra mashed into the cornmeal. Black-eyed peas are a refrain in the kitchen; lightly fried, they sit alongside the crab cake appetizer, an excellent deviled version, racy with lemon juice and mustard. When she is firmly on the ground again, I\u2019d suggest the smoked pork chop with a lightly candied glaze of pralines and a scoop of bourbon yams.\n        \n\n         Mr. Johnson works out his menus with Minton\u2019s executive chef, Alexander Smalls. Both men are African-American, as are the restaurant\u2019s principal owner, Richard Parsons, and pastry chef, Mame Sow. Mr. Smalls, a\n         \n\n\n          South Carolina\n         \n         native, is a particular exponent of Lowcountry cuisine, which carries lasting imprints of West African and\n         \n\n\n          Caribbean\n         \n         cooking. There are direct quotations from South Carolina, like smooth she-crab soup or the crab and shrimp on fat, fluffy grains of grits. And there are riffs on the African theme, including collards cooked so they keep some of their crunch and dressed with a spiced peanut sauce. It\u2019s just a side dish, but I haven\u2019t stopped thinking about it.\n        \n\n         The less said about the kitchen\u2019s weakest night, the better. I\u2019ll just express my doubts that octopus and unripe strawberries were meant to be joined in ice-cold union, along with my strong feeling that tiny, dense, sweet corn muffins are neither \u201cpopovers\u201d nor a good thing to eat alongside smoked trout, and leave it at that.\n        \n\n         What matters is that we left the table happy, an unusual outcome after a rocky meal. Ms. Sow\u2019s desserts helped, especially her elegant baked alaska with a foundation of graham cracker cake and a filling of smoked and toasted marshmallow ice cream \u2014 s\u2019mores with a Dress Sharp attitude. So did the young musicians working out nuanced, intricate compositions in this sophisticated Harlem room. When you hear Harlem, you picture one of two places: the great hive of African-American ideas and culture that flourished and disappeared, like Atlantis, or the modern neighborhood of wine bars, construction cranes and million-dollar apartments. The two Harlems meet at Minton\u2019s when a serious band is onstage and gumbo is on the table.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 193, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/29/dining/restaurant-review-mintons-in-harlem.html", "google_mag": 26.399999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n         When it appeared on Orchard Street in 2012,\n         \n          Mission Chinese Food\n         \n         was slightly unreal. It didn\u2019t seem to follow the rules, or even know that there were rules. The health department and other city agencies knew, though, and after just 18 months, they pulled the plug on Danny Bowien\u2019s hallucinatory all-ages chile-pepper party.\n        \n\n         At its new address on East Broadway, there is a host behind a lectern instead of a dude handing out plastic cups near the beer keg. While the old space looked as if it had been built by Mr. Bowien and his friends with two-by-fours, a staple gun and a paper dragon, the new two-level dining room with half-moon booths of brushed red velvet under bistro mirrors was inherited from an earlier restaurant that seemed to have employed a licensed architect and a professional designer.\n        \n\n         Now there is a well-appointed kitchen in the basement, not Orchard Street\u2019s narrow galley behind plexiglass, where the heat and flames were so ferocious that Mr. Bowien seemed intent on turning himself into the nightly special, grilled chef. He still wears shorts on his trips to the dining room, but now it looks like a fashion choice, not a matter of survival.\n        \n\n         While very few items on the old menu couldn\u2019t be knocked together by one person with a wok in less than five minutes, many dishes now speak of ample counter space and many hands, including those of\n         \n          Angela Dimayuga\n         \n         , the executive chef. (Mr. Bowien is the chef and owner.) Of her many contributions to Mission Chinese Food, the one everybody wants to talk about is Josefina\u2019s house special chicken. Josefina is Ms. Dimayuga\u2019s grandmother, a Filipina, and her chicken is no short-order stir fry. The bird is roasted with a stuffing of fresh chorizo, raisins, olives, sweet pickles and butter. It is carried to the table on a silver platter, feet splayed out, head tucked in. When the torso is cut into thick slices, the center of each one has the white-and-yellow ring of a hard-cooked egg. Everything about Josefina\u2019s chicken is great.\n        \n\n         The recipe is most likely of Spanish descent. This should make it an idiosyncratic fixture in a Chinese restaurant, but idiosyncrasy is to Mission Chinese Food what the Bloomin\u2019 Onion is to an Outback Steakhouse.\n        \n\n         In the original\n         \n\n\n          San Francisco\n         \n         incarnation, as well as in the first New York location, most of the idiosyncrasies looped around Sichuan cuisine. Many of the old dishes, marked as much by Mr. Bowien\u2019s freethinking approach as by the burn and tingle of chiles and Sichuan peppercorns, have migrated to the new restaurant: the kung pao pastrami; the galvanizing lamb ribs with sweet, gooey dates; the Chongqing chicken wings so acutely spicy and flavorful they make\n         \n\n\n          Buffalo\n         \n         wings seem as dangerous as an animal cracker.\n        \n\n         But this kind of scorched-tongue cooking has become a minor motif in Mr. Bowien and Ms. Dimayuga\u2019s menu, which goes on for pages. Fewer than a third of the items are marked by red flames blazing from what looks like a pair of cheeks, and not the ones you kiss your grandmother on. The rest is not just less fire-spewing but more varied than before, drawing from regions beyond Sichuan and countries beyond\n         \n\n\n          China\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         Some of it is even nuanced. Splashing around in a gentle, aromatic pool of chamomile, almond milk and saffron, the steamed\n         \n\n\n          Napa\n         \n         cabbage has more in common with a chai latte than with Mr. Bowien\u2019s pork-drenched mapo tofu. There is a startlingly well-calibrated, nori-sprinkled salad of red cabbage in a Caesar-esque vinaigrette of soy, miso, sesame and anchovy. Konnichiwa, Caesar! Another salad waves toward\n         \n\n\n          Vietnam\n         \n         , with green papaya threads, roasted peanuts, sliced banana blossoms and shreds of lightly smoked chicken.\n        \n\n         The perfume of dill, mint and basil rises up from a bowl of cellophane noodles in deeply aromatic lamb soup. Grassy, astringent matcha is sprinkled over green-tea noodles with scallions and ginger. Fried rice with sweet and tender lumps of lobster is fragrant with coconut oil.\n        \n\n         Whole dorade can be cooked two ways: roasted in the wood-burning oven with turmeric and pickled chiles, or deep-fried and plopped down on a sheet pan over fat noodles and hunks of purple taro, with an armful of fresh herbs thrown on top.\n        \n\n         All of these are smart, layered and vibrant enough to win over anybody who shows up thinking that Mission Chinese Food is still in the business of knocking your head against the wall until you smile or pass out or both. It\u2019s easier to taste the quieter flavors now. With the extra space and staff, the kitchen pays some attention to the order in which dishes arrive, so it can keep the more antisocial ones in solitary confinement.\n        \n\n         Nobody is going to mistake Mission Chinese Food for a rarefied tasting room, though, not when you can get a pepperoni pizza. Mine was too soupy, but the same sourdough starter is the base for two different puffballs of bread, both tossed into the wood-fired oven, both with a natural-yeast flavor that rewards slow, appreciative chewing. One makes a fine platform for smoky pickled chiles and excellent oil-cured anchovies straight from the can, but my favorite way to eat it is to swipe it through a little dish of softened kefir butter in its own buttermilk.\n        \n\n         On Orchard Street, the throttlingly loud music, the elbows-in-your-ribs seating, the chile-induced sweats and the improbably low prices (nothing cost more than $15 when\n         \n          I gave the restaurant two stars in 2012\n         \n         ) conspired to cover the kitchen\u2019s lapses. You registered the bumps, but as on the Cyclone, they were part of the ride. They matter more now that the menu is rich with check-goosing banquet dishes and the restaurant aims for a degree of finesse.\n        \n\n         There is a wine list now, stocked with semi-obscure natural wines. In the five months the restaurant has been open, servers have memorized a few stock phrases, like \u201cit goes well with our food\u201d (imagine that), but have not learned which part of the corkscrew will remove a metal bottle cap, or when to stop pouring an unfiltered wine to keep sediment from sliding into the glass.\n        \n\n         I liked taking a hammer to a clay brick to reveal a whole duck confit stuffed with sticky rice and chestnuts, and liked the rich and oily meat I tore from the legs, but I didn\u2019t love the dry breast meat, and I wouldn\u2019t mind taking a hammer to the $100 price tag. I also won\u2019t be handing over another $150 for a smoked prime rib topped with a king crab leg, a garnish that just seemed like bait for the hedge-fund crowd. For far less money, the celery with hazelnuts that was so nicely stir-fried one time was nearly raw the next. I might have loved the just-cooked black kale with pickled plums if not for the overpowering brininess.\n        \n\n         But these are normal lapses for what has become, against the odds and to almost everybody\u2019s benefit, a nearly normal restaurant. The\n         \n\n\n          hallucinations\n         \n         may have stopped, but Mission Chinese Food is still a trip.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 194, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/10/dining/restaurant-review-mission-chinese-food-on-the-lower-east-side.html", "google_mag": 25.200000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n         Halfway through dinner at Blue Hill, my server presented me with two squashes. One was the common football-size butternut that weighs down shopping bags at this time of year. The other had the same shape but was about as big as a sparrow. I held it in my palm. It felt good in there. Without thinking about what I was doing, I began petting it. The couple at the next table asked if they could see my tiny squash, and I let them stroke its smooth, cool skin. Before things got too weird, our server took my pet squash back to the kitchen.\n        \n\n         When it came back, it had been roasted and cut in half. Specks of white pepper and strands of grated chestnut lay against its dark orange insides. It was sweeter than a normal butternut, but what I mostly noticed was that it tasted squashier, as if all the flavor had been compressed. Selective breeding was responsible, our server explained. Dan Barber, Blue Hill\u2019s executive chef and a co-owner with his brother, David, had asked\n         \n          a Cornell agriculture professor\n         \n         to design a squash for him, making it as small and tasty as possible. The result is\n         \n          the 898 squash\n         \n         , served exclusively at Mr. Barber\u2019s two restaurants,\n         \n          Blue Hill at Stone Barns\n         \n         in Pocantico Hills, N.Y., and this one, just off Washington Square Park.\n        \n\n         Mr. Barber opened the one in\n         \n\n\n          Manhattan\n         \n         first, in 2000, with the idea of using local seasonal produce, including some from his family\u2019s farm in the\n         \n\n\n          Berkshires\n         \n         . This put him in the company of, oh, several hundred other chefs. A few years later, though, he was chosen to lead an\n         \n          ambitious project\n         \n         at Stone Barns that combined a farm and a restaurant with research and education programs.\n        \n\n         It turned out that he was born for the job. Patient, intense, curious, enthusiastic, articulate, Mr. Barber has become a dirt poet and kitchen philosopher whose time outside with the pigs and the beans has had a deep, lasting effect on the way he cooks. Today no other chef has the information he keeps in his head (how to make pure carbon out of a cow\u2019s femur) or the vegetables he puts in his ovens (sparrow-size squash).\n        \n\n         To get the Full Barber, you have to go to Stone Barns for a $198 menu-free, open-ended meal that may include, if you\u2019re lucky, a tour of the manure shed where hot compost is put to work as cooking fuel. The original Blue Hill sits in the English basement of a townhouse in Greenwich Village, a historically tolerant neighborhood whose tolerance does not extend to manure sheds. The city doesn\u2019t afford the time or space for the leisurely unfurling of Mr. Barber\u2019s complete vision of how our appetites should fit into the land and the climate. The low-ceilinged space is too much like a saloon, the tables too close together, the restaurant\u2019s many ardent admirers too accustomed to treating it as a place to catch up over an excellent weeknight dinner.\n        \n\n         If Blue Hill had as many cooks and servers as its more favored sister upstate, they would probably iron out wrinkles like the long, stranded layovers between courses; the wineglasses that sat empty and were finally cleared with no offer of fresh ones; and the $23 glass of Rully poured ice-cold, so it was clenched and astringent. It also seems far out of character that this intensely local restaurant sells just two New York wines on its Francophilic (and not very value-minded) list, and that its only cider comes from\n         \n\n\n          California\n         \n         when there is a cider revival going on in Mr. Barber\u2019s own, apple-rich state.\n        \n\n         But while it may give you only a Half Barber, Blue Hill is still an exceptional restaurant. Mr. Barber\u2019s long search for flavor out of town pays off downtown, where you find yourself thinking, again and again, that each new ingredient may well be the best example of its kind you\u2019ve ever tasted. For this reason and others, Blue Hill is one of the few New York restaurants that seem to get better and more original as time goes by. This was true\n         \n          the last time it was reviewed\n         \n         in\n         \n\n\n          The New York Times\n         \n         , in 2006, when Frank Bruni brought it from two stars to three, and it is true now.\n        \n\n         Dinner at Blue Hill can go in one of two directions: a four-course, $85 menu that you choose, or a longer, free-form \u201cfarmer\u2019s feast\u201d chosen by Mr. Barber or his chef de cuisine, Shingoon Hong, for $98 or $125, depending on how hungry the farmer is. Either way, the night will include a couple of surprise cameos by fruits and vegetables that drop in like the kooky neighbors in a sitcom.\n        \n\n         A meal in September started with wispy young fennel stalks that had a clean and pure licorice sweetness and ended with firm, green-skinned, yellow-fleshed plums on ice. Both made me happy I had come to Blue Hill then, not a week sooner or later, which is the effect that certain fruits and vegetables can have when they\u2019re picked at the right time. In a more recent meal, the kitchen sent out a raw hakurei turnip as big as an apple. In fact, it had been pushed through an apple slicer. I picked up a white wedge, swiped it through a pool of tarragon vinaigrette and braced for the harsh turnip aftertaste that never came. I won\u2019t tell you that I ate the whole thing, or that it was as sweet and juicy as an apple, but it came much closer than I would have thought possible.\n        \n\n         When it comes to actual cooking, Mr. Barber\u2019s approach is to intensify ingredients that are pretty intense already. Looking at the saturated orange color of fat slabs of roasted carrot \u201ccutlet,\u201d I could tell it was going to taste richer and rounder than any carrot I had met before. The approach works on things that once had a pulse, too. Grass-fed, dry-aged veal, carved into a sampler of cuts, some fattier, some leaner, was ruddier and more bloody-tasting than most veal, but it still had a focused, refined taste that set it apart from beef. The caramelized outside edge of a slowly roasted neck from a Blue Hill Farm goat had a profoundly satisfying chew; the meat hiding under it was astoundingly tender and juicy. It had some of the primal pleasures of barbecue, and I wanted to tear into it with my hands.\n        \n\n         In the early days of Blue Hill, I respected the cooking but didn\u2019t want to wallow around in it the way I do now. The whole complicated web that Mr. Barber oversees has many purposes, spinning off in all directions, but if you just sit down to dinner, you can believe that the point of the entire operation is to provide you with one delicious taste after another. And maybe it is.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 196, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/dining/restaurant-review-blue-hill-in-greenwich-village.html", "google_mag": 22.899999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n         I came up with my nature-preserve theory of tasting menus while eating a cabbage sandwich at\n         \n          Semilla\n         \n         , a new restaurant in Williamsburg,\n         \n\n\n          Brooklyn\n         \n         , across the street from Jack\u2019s Cancellation Shoes and Rachel\u2019s Corset Discount Center (\u201cspecializing in hard to fit sizes\u201d).\n        \n\n         Semilla had taken two cabbage leaves, then flattened and dried them until they were as crisp as a cracker. This was the bread. In between were a bundle of unusually delicious coleslaw and some grains of buckwheat groats. It wasn\u2019t the most securely buckled-down sandwich I\u2019ve ever eaten; some of the buckwheat fell out on the horseshoe-shaped counter around which Semilla\u2019s 18 seats are arranged.\n        \n\n         But I liked the way the buckwheat that stayed in the sandwich cracked between my teeth like Grape-Nuts. The flavors woke up old memories of the Polish and Ukrainian restaurants that are mostly gone from the East Village. And it was undeniably cool to have cabbage-leaf \u201cbread\u201d arrive at my place without warning. Diners at Semilla don\u2019t see a list of the 10 or so courses for which they are being charged $75 until the next day, when an email arrives from the restaurant.\n        \n\n         The sandwich struck me as a dish that might not last long on an \u00e0 la carte menu. How many New Yorkers would choose to spend their dinner money on pressed cabbage when they could have broiled oysters or beef ribs or kale salad? By cordoning it off within a meal that has to be taken as a package deal, Semilla had sheltered the cabbage sandwich from the roughshod forces of the marketplace, the way the government might protect nests built by the gentle piping plover by banning four-wheel drive vehicles from the beach.\n        \n\n         The market\u2019s relentless pressures to turn tables, to goose the check and so on are clear to anyone who goes out to eat in New York. It\u2019s less obvious how those pressures may influence menus until we stop to ask why so many are virtually identical, with the same salads and the same cuts of the same animals. If not for minor variations in sauces and side dishes, we\u2019d all fall asleep after our first cocktail.\n        \n\n         Semilla\u2019s chef, Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez-Ruiz, and its pastry chef, Pamela Yung, are using the nature-preserve possibilities of the tasting menu so their customers can taste dishes that weren\u2019t concocted to please the marketplace. This is a familiar concept in music, film and art. It has come to New York dining only recently as multicourse, limited-choice menus have spread from the empyrean realms of\n         \n          Per Se\n         \n         and\n         \n          Atera\n         \n         to more affordable, less formal precincts like\n         \n          Contra\n         \n         and Semilla.\n        \n\n         Understand, as you enter this nature preserve, that you will be browsing extensively upon stems, tubers, rhizomes, seeds and other plant parts. Semilla tends to save fish and meat for moments when extra depth or intensity are needed. For instance, a paste of salt cod that covered the bottom of a plate in a thin layer, like gesso on raw canvas, acted like a dip for charred cups of cipollini onion and circles of rutabaga. It\u2019s a dish that draws you in, as much for the rutabaga, which showed off its little-known talent for tasting like three or four vegetables at once, as for the salt cod, distilled to a potent cream so good I ran my fork around the plate twice to make sure I hadn\u2019t left any.\n        \n\n         At Semilla (Spanish for seed), the term for this style of cooking is \u201cvegetable forward.\u201d This both warns vegetarians and vegans that they will need to ask in advance for substitutions, and reassures those for whom the term vegetarian cooking still evokes tie-dyed flashbacks of carrot-lentil loaf. Mr. Ram\u00edrez-Ruiz, the chief vegetable manipulator, owes almost nothing to that branch of the vegetarian family tree. It\u2019s easier to see the imprint of Per Se,\n         \n          the Chef\u2019s Table at Brooklyn Fare\n         \n         and\n         \n          Isa\n         \n         , all former employers, in the way he elegantly props one flavor against the next. He makes a frothy soup of beer and grilled celery root, then pours it over \u201cnoodles\u201d shaved from a celery root; whipped Cheddar adds tang as it melts into the soup, and puffed quinoa gives it a breakfast-cereal snap, crackle and pop.\n        \n\n         Ms. Yung, another Isa veteran, who has been teaching sugar and flour new tricks since her days behind the counter at\n         \n          Room 4 Dessert\n         \n         , contributes two sweet courses at the meal\u2019s end. (An inspired one brought black-truffle ice cream together with an electrifyingly tart Seville orange sauce.) She is also responsible for the hot sourdough bread that shows up at about halftime and often incorporates whole grains, such as farro and einkorn, that she grinds in a countertop mill stored on a shelf above the kitchen pass. (Most of the kitchen is visible from the seats and the rest can be seen through one-way glass slots in the restroom wall. At least, I think it\u2019s one-way glass.)\n        \n\n         One night she had filled out the dough with cooked oatmeal, and the bread was pleasantly sticky under its thick crust. On all nights the bread arrives with a swirl of creamy butter and a trickle of buttermilk. There are aspects of Semilla over which reasonable people can disagree, but Ms. Yung\u2019s bread isn\u2019t one of them.\n        \n\n         I could argue, though, that the $75 price will keep out some of the young, creative-underclass types who may appreciate what the chefs are up to. I\u2019d also say that Semilla\u2019s servers should stop assuming that everybody has been initiated into the cult of natural wines; a guest of mine found the two samples she was poured too eccentric, and decided to drink nothing \u2014 a lost opportunity on each side of the bar.\n        \n\n         Inevitably, I wished a few dishes at Semilla had been swatted to the floor by the market\u2019s invisible hand. One was a plate that I\u2019ve come to call \u201ctoo much cabbage with too many soybeans.\u201d Another was an ice cream Ms. Yung made out of colza oil. Colza oil is a close cousin of canola oil; frozen, it tastes like cold lubricant.\n        \n\n         There is risk in this kind of cooking. There is reward, too, and the chance to find out how good a rutabaga spring roll can be when you dip it in bittersweet orange juice reduction. Whenever I glanced at the other people huddled around the ash countertop, I saw far more appreciative nods than puzzled grimaces. The crowd reminded me of the audiences, small but intense, who showed up to hear underground bands in the \u201980s and \u201990s, when that was one of the few ways to hear music that didn\u2019t get played on the radio.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 198, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/25/dining/restaurant-review-semilla-in-williamsburg-brooklyn.html", "google_mag": 26.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n            \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d my dinner companion asked one night at\n            \n             Chevalier\n            \n            , the luxurious new French restaurant in Midtown at the base of the Baccarat Hotel & Residences New York. \u201cYou look like you just saw a ghost.\u201d\n           \n\n            Maybe I had. A man wearing an elegantly knotted silk tie had just materialized at our side and wished us \u201cbon app\u00e9tit\u201d with the ease of a native speaker. He was Charles Masson, who for years steered the stately old ship of La Grenouille until a family struggle sent him out on the streets. He landed at Chevalier as the \u201cdirector.\u201d\n           \n\n            In\n            \n             the pre-opening press\n            \n            , Mr. Masson drew as much attention as the chef, Shea Gallante, formerly of Ciano and Cru. But just a month after the opening in early April, he\n            \n             announced\n            \n            that he was leaving. Now, four weeks after that, I was startled to see him in the flesh, still haunting the dining room, wishing us a healthy appetite as we faced our scallops and cavatelli.\n           \n\n            Today Mr. Masson is officially gone, but Chevalier is still searching for a guiding spirit. This place is confused about its identity. The designer\n            \n             Stephen Sills\n            \n            gave the dining room the soft glimmer of an abalone shell; it\u2019s pretty, but it also looks like a movie director\u2019s idea of a restaurant for rich people. Some of the customers get into the spirit: On two separate nights, somebody walked in with the help of a sterling silver-handled cane. As one of my guests said, it\u2019s a place where Bruce Wayne would have dinner.\n           \n\n            According to the website, though, Chevalier is a \u201cbrasserie de luxe.\u201d The first person who can successfully explain what it has in common with a brasserie wins a choucroute garnie for 12 at my house.\n           \n\n            Finding the right tone for a new restaurant is fiendishly complicated. As expense and ambitions increase, so do the complications, and Chevalier is both expensive and ambitious. Already, even as it tries to figure itself out, there is a lot to enjoy. Mr. Gallante\u2019s cooking is a little hard to pin down, but every meal reminded me just how compelling Ciano and Cru had been when he was in charge.\n           \n\n            Anybody whose taste buds are in working order could work up a good appetite for those cavatelli \u2014 chewy but tender, yolk-enriched, and shiny in a sharp, springlike ramp pesto with smoked pecorino. The next course brought what has to be the greatest piece of roasted veal loin I\u2019ve ever met, supremely flavorful and juicy.\n           \n\n            The long slabs of dry-aged duck breast I ate another night had all the intensity, the blood-rich tang and the richness that I\u2019m starting to give up on getting from steak. Thick slices of pork loin ringed with a narrow band of well-rendered fat were a model of subtle, sensitive roasting; most chefs can\u2019t come up with pork this juicy without brining it until it\u2019s as salty as ham.\n           \n\n            Mr. Gallante is smart enough to leave these strong flavors alone, with just minor help from the rest of the plate. With the duck came a dab of Medjool date-red wine sauce, not too sweet, and the pork got by with just a breezy, summery helping of beans and garlic scapes.\n           \n\n            With seafood, the sauces do more of the work. A buttery emulsion with a trace of lemon verbena was neatly calibrated for black sea bass; cucumber chopped to a pulp and yuzu juice had a powerful and wonderful effect on raw Japanese yellowtail.\n           \n\n            The charcuterie plate is a marvel of offal craftsmanship: duck rillettes with a bullet of foie gras shot right through the center; rough-hewed and pistachio-flecked liverwurst; calf\u2019s tongue and chicken liver mousse layered in a terrine with a bronze jiggle of Madeira jelly on top; saucisson sec with a clear, bracing fermented sourness.\n           \n\n            Wow. But the same restaurant that achieved this near miracle also served foie gras mousse as cold and hard as butter right out of the refrigerator. I couldn\u2019t spread it; worse, I couldn\u2019t taste it.\n           \n\n            The veal that had been so transporting was, the next time I tried it, cooked to the unappetizing pinkish-gray color of canned tuna. Both nights, it came with a stodgy nub of sweetbread, reminiscent of pressed tofu.\n           \n\n            Fried soft-shell crab with burrata sounded weird on the menu and was weirder on the plate. It was like watching a bad date. I kept waiting for one of the ingredients to get an urgent text from a roommate who\u2019s locked out of the apartment.\n           \n\n            Although Chevalier often seems to be in out-of-town-tryout mode, it charges Broadway prices. This may get ironed out in September, when the menu will go \u00e0 la carte. Right now, a three-course prix fixe dinner is $96; two courses are $74, which means you could save $22 by skipping David Carmichael\u2019s accomplished French desserts.\n           \n\n            The prix isn\u2019t entirely fixe, though. The dense chocolate souffl\u00e9, which to be fair is enough for two and is delivered with a dark-chocolate, cr\u00e8me-anglaise-filled egg that servers carefully crack and place on the souffl\u00e9, is $8.50 extra. Side dishes, like excellent gratin dauphinois, are $12 extra; the charcuterie plate is $26 extra.\n           \n\n            Mr. Gallante also promised lower, more consistent prices for the bar, where the situation now borders on the irrational. A manhattan was $18, but a gin and tonic was $20. One night, my companion pointed to my $22 Moscow Mule and asked the bartender for something \u201cjust like his, but different.\u201d One difference was its price, $24.\n           \n\n            Tweaks are planned for uniforms, d\u00e9cor and \u201cservice sensibility,\u201d which the publicist said \u201cwill definitely be lightened.\u201d I have no complaints about the service itself; the dining room staff came out of the gate with the fluid, watchful poise of people who have been in place for years. But its Old World tone would make more sense if the restaurant itself had a clearer point of view.\n           \n\n            Chevalier and its hotel were built by a real estate conglomerate, which sold them but still manages both through a subsidiary company. The conglomerate also owns the Baccarat crystal firm, and sprinkled its sparkly glass all over the building. At Chevalier, named after a Baccarat designer, the product placement is subtle but ever-present. There are charms in drinking water from heavy crystal tumblers, not least of all the workout you give your biceps, but it\u2019s hard to escape the feeling that customer pleasure is secondary to corporate interests.\n           \n\n            Chevalier seems to have been conceived as a French luxury restaurant, in other words, simply because Baccarat is a French luxury company. French luxury restaurants can be wonderful, but they have to be played with conviction. Mr. Masson could have supplied that, but now it will have to come from somewhere else.\n           \n\n            Of course, there is one luxury that would overcome all arguments. Food as consistently good as the charcuterie plate and that first veal loin would make Chevalier a destination. It just wouldn\u2019t be a brasserie.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 200, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/12/dining/restaurant-review-chevalier-in-midtown.html", "google_mag": 26.200000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n            Tim Cushman, the creative and prolific chef of\n            \n             O Ya in Boston\n            \n            and its\n            \n             new spinoff in Manhattan\n            \n            , does not break the rules of Japanese cuisine. He slices them into tiny pieces, fries them to a crisp and heaps them over raw fish. Bite by bite, he gets away with it. But over the course of the two prolonged tastings that are the only options at the New York branch, one for $185 and the other for $245, the rules eventually catch up with him.\n           \n\n            Physically, the restaurant is an appealing mix of tradition and a loose American style. Attached to the Park South Hotel on East 28th Street, it has a separate entrance veiled by stands of bamboo and an upright boulder. Inside is a long counter where at least a half-dozen cooks slice fish and mold rice. At least as many people are visible in the partly open kitchen, working away at hot dishes.\n           \n\n            The front of the room is done in pale wood slats and looks Japanese, while the main seating area is a long row of tables with a red tapestry-upholstered banquette under a brick wall and an exposed metal air duct.\n           \n\n            Mr. Cushman\u2019s chosen medium is sushi and sashimi, but the pristine simplicity of Tokyo\u2019s edomae sushi is not Mr. Cushman\u2019s style. With rice or without, seafood is scattered, smothered and covered with garnishes and sauces from all over, even Japan. Mr. Cushman really goes for it, and what\u2019s surprising is that he almost never loses control. His one-bite dishes unwind into spools of flavor that you don\u2019t quite see coming, even though a server has already told you what you\u2019re about to eat.\n           \n\n            Turning Japanese convention around, an O Ya meal starts with sushi, then backs into sashimi. Draped over a bed of rice is a small omelet, neatly folded into a thin, soft envelope. Quietly seasoned with garlic-chive flowers, the egg tastes subtle and delicate at first, then goes very deep from the rich and savory flavor of a Wagyu beef fat that\u2019s been turned into a fluffy white powder that looks like confectioners\u2019 sugar.\n           \n\n            Fatty, ruby-red ocean trout gets a double-barreled blast of Vietnam from a caramel dashi and a salsa of rau ram, the herb that tastes like a minty super-cilantro. A pungent black olive pur\u00e9e and a raw shiso sauce punch up a buttery slice of pike mackerel. Hamachi may seem too delicate for its fiery crown of banana pepper mousse, but it\u2019s not.\n           \n\n            Halfway through, when the rice threatens to flatten your appetite, it suddenly goes away. One night, the change was announced with a tiny volcano of golden-eye snapper erupting with crisp strands of wild ginger, sitting in a lake of white soy freshened up with yuzu. This is sashimi that resets the taste buds, preparing the way for more intensity to come.\n           \n\n            Under a dime-size shaving of Burgundian truffle was a small, very good scallop from Hokkaido, surrounded by a sea urchin-sake sauce so bright and delicious that I\u2019d drink it from a hose, a rubber tub, an old work boot or anything else that was handy. Vietnam was revisited in kanpachi with fried shallots in a lean, light, spicy nuoc cham.\n           \n\n            With dishes like this, you understand why O Ya is one of Boston\u2019s favorite destinations for a blowout meal. (An \u00e0 la carte option theoretically allows you to get out for less than you\u2019d spend in New York, although in practice many people have a hard time stopping there.) But the dishes are not all like this.\n           \n\n            The squid-ink foam and yuzu kosho aioli may get along well with a fried oyster sitting on a drum of rice rolled in nori, but the oyster was so overbattered and overcooked I couldn\u2019t tell. It was like a dragon roll that didn\u2019t work out. Three squares of seared Wagyu over coins of confit potatoes should have been a woozy treat, but weren\u2019t. This intensely marbled beef can be very good either chilled and firm or heated and lush with melting fat. At O Ya, it was always somewhere in between: just warm enough to taste greasy.\n           \n\n            When it comes to sushi fundamentals, O Ya\u2019s rule-breaking returns to haunt it. The rice, which should be warm and fragrant with vinegar, was usually cold and underseasoned. In some pieces, like the fried oyster, this bland rice was densely packed into a drum inside nori. (Traditionally, this would be done by gently wrapping seaweed around a loose ball of rice, but O Ya seems to roll it into a tight cigar.) Bites that began wonderfully would end with a thud. And there were small imperfections, such as the big white scale stuck to one piece of fish or the stringy sinews in a piece of tuna belly, that would cause a minor scandal at a traditional sushi bar charging these prices.\n           \n\n            Clunky rice was one reason I cheered silently each time the meal marched into the sashimi movement. Another was monotony. After a while, I\u2019d start to wish the kitchen would let me catch my breath with a course that wasn\u2019t more fish covered with more stuff and a sauce or two.\n           \n\n            Mr. Cushman can throw a mean changeup when he wants to. I had a great, silly time filling my mouth with a spoonful of frozen foie gras pellets and preserved lemon, and I fell into a minor trance drinking matsutake mushroom broth perked up with a squeeze of limelike sudachi. But these breaks from routine come only with the $245 menu.\n           \n\n            Both tastings downshift from savory to sweet with a remarkable bite that brings the two themes together, seared foie gras sushi dabbed with eel sauce and a bit of dark chocolate with wine-soaked raisins. Even if you have skipped the $95 or $115 wine pairings, the course arrives with a glass of sweet, sherrylike aged sake that doesn\u2019t just complement it but completes it.\n           \n\n            Then come desserts and the respite that the meal has needed. In early fall, tapioca pudding with Concord grape sauce, cantaloupe sherbet and shiso ice made an appealingly seasonal refresher. This was followed by a ganache of dark chocolate with lightly smoky green-tea ice cream and shards of honeycomb toffee, a sophisticated way to close out.\n           \n\n            There is one last treat as you leave: a little sardine tin. Peel back the lid, and you find two colorful fish molded from passion-fruit gummy candy. By the time you taste them, you are back on the street, wondering why the whole meal couldn\u2019t be this much fun.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 201, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/dining/o-ya-review.html", "google_mag": 22.899999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n\n             High Street on Hudson\n            \n            is an adventurous and often exciting restaurant trying extremely hard to pass for an ordinary West Village cafe. \u201cPhilly spinoff providing house-made breads & pastries, elevated sandwiches, coffee & cocktails,\u201d is Google\u2019s capsule summary. The description is factual to the last ampersand, yet it doesn\u2019t go past the camouflage this place wrapped around itself when it sidled into town in December.\n           \n\n            What is missing, what you may miss at first if you came for breakfast or lunch, the only meals High Street on Hudson served in its first few weeks of life, is the high level of intelligence the kitchen applies to everything it does from morning through evening.\n           \n\n            The chef, Eli Kulp, is unmistakably trying to make his mark in New York after making his name in Philadelphia. (He was traveling between the two cities last year when his Amtrak train derailed, leaving him with serious spinal injuries.) At dinner, the time when chefs make their big statements, the menu turned out to be full of small oddities and unexpected ripples of flavor when it was finally unveiled in January. Yet his restaurant doesn\u2019t just put on a show at night and wait for you to be impressed. Mr. Kulp and his business partner, Ellen Yin, understand that coffee and a great pastry can be just as meaningful before noon as an artfully plated duck breast is after dark.\n           \n\n            Restaurants that aim to be useful and interesting all day long are\n            \n             becoming more common in Los Angeles\n            \n            and other cities; New York could use more of them.\n           \n\n            The view into the windows from Hudson Street says bakery: You can see bread on shelves, a squarish seeded rye and a round buckwheat loaf with dried cherries inside. Baked by Alex Bois, they have the roughness and flavor of whole grains, the complicated taste of slow-rising dough, and the kind of dark, thick, crackling crust you want to feel between your teeth.\n           \n\n            In a glass case by the door are a few of Samantha Kincaid\u2019s pastries, fewer as the day goes on. The neighbors are especially fond of carrying off the round doughnuts rolled in spiced sugar and filled with salty cider caramel.\n           \n\n            Unlike\n            \n             Sadelle\u2019s\n            \n            , which also has a retail bakery up front, High Street on Hudson puts virtually all of its pastries on the daily menus. An ideal breakfast could be made of coffee and the witty red-eye Danish, a flaky golden swirl with warm country ham over a bull\u2019s-eye of bittersweet pastry cream made with espresso.\n           \n\n            Or it could revolve around a black bialy. This oddball creature, dark with squid ink and strewn with sesame seeds, is soft and chewy, with pickled peppers and a mound of tart, uncreamy whitefish salad pressed into its divot.\n           \n\n            Cooking at breakfast takes the form of egg sandwiches. My choice of these is the Bodega, an incongruous name for a countrified affair of flattened sage sausage and Cheddar on a biscuit with a mule kick of black pepper. Like the other sandwiches, the Bodega arrives alongside a grilled hot pepper on an irregular block of wood. This is both affected and counterproductive; a boring old plate would do a better job of keeping food off the table. (What\u2019s going to happen to all these fancy boards once they stop being cool and everybody admits what a pain they are?)\n           \n\n            I am tempted to jump from breakfast straight to dinner out of cowardice. I would rather not have to say that lunch is the weakest meal of the day. The sandwiches are the trouble. The pastrami is a buzz kill, an inert mass of cold pink meat sliced too thickly on too much rye. Another is called the Best Grilled Cheese Ever. It isn\u2019t. (Granted, calling a sandwich the Best Grilled Cheese Ever is like naming your child Jesus Buddha.)\n           \n\n            If a place is going to go to the trouble of baking those first-rate breads, it should keep a closer eye on the laws of contrast and proportion that mean success or failure in the sandwich universe. Sandwich engineering is a skill of its own, or maybe an instinct.\n           \n\n            When it gets dark, High Street on Hudson doesn\u2019t entirely pack up the bakery. One of Mr. Kulp\u2019s more clever moves is to integrate dinner into the overall program with a few breads and some of the regionally grown grains they\u2019re made from.\n           \n\n            Vollkornbrot, a dark German rye riddled with sunflower seeds, is a wonderful thing to eat when it\u2019s buttered and griddled and spread with rutabaga hummus, which could double as vegetarian chicken-liver p\u00e2t\u00e9. Slices of anadama, a venerable New England cornmeal loaf sweetened with molasses, are topped with very rich, very tender, very smoky eel.\n           \n\n            I was happily surprised that sunflower seeds cooked into a creamy mock risotto could be so appealing. A less pleasant surprise was the portion size, too small to be served as a separate course to our table of four. Apart from the breads, the menu is a longish list under a single category, \u201cTo Share.\u201d The kitchen decides what to send out when, and it doesn\u2019t always make the right call.\n           \n\n            Tempura-style broccoli is at the start of that list and, ideally, at the start of your meal. Impressively crisp, it gets a refreshing assist from pickled wood-ear mushrooms and an exhilarating dribble of spicy chowchow relish.\n           \n\n            Halfway down the menu you come to the pastas. Do not, for any reason short of an allergy, ignore the bucatini with squid and mussels. Mr. Kulp, who was chef de cuisine at\n            \n             Torrisi Italian Specialties\n            \n            before he moved to Philadelphia, knows what he is doing in the pasta department. The bucatini are flavored with seaweed, a terrific idea, and the plate is finished with lobster bottarga shaved into rose-colored petals, an even more terrific idea. It may be the finest use of lobster coral anybody has come up with.\n           \n\n            Toward the bottom of the menu are what used to be called main courses. Arctic char is sauced with a very smart remix of a gribiche; the eggs are pickled for extra snap. And while the phrase \u201csoured grains\u201d does not make the heart go pitter-pat, I could work up some affection for the thing it described, a tart, almost refreshing porridge served under fat slices of duck breast with especially flavorful skin.\n           \n\n            You may expect a place serving soured grains to go salty and savory with its desserts. And you\u2019d be correct. I like them, mostly, but I\u2019d rather have a piece of the spiced kabocha cake, or the cream puff, with its soft spill of Meyer-lemon cream, followed by a cookie offered on a tray by a smiling woman at the door.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 202, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/09/dining/high-street-on-hudson-review.html", "google_mag": 22.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n\n             Sadelle\u2019s\n            \n            is one restaurant by day and another, completely different restaurant by night.\n           \n\n            Dinner is calm, unhurried, basted in candlelight. The relatively short menu is inspired by the luxe comforts of czarist Russia, from delicate little veal pelmeni to tins of sturgeon caviar on ice, served with latkes, lavishly buttered pancakes and rye toast on a three-story platter.\n           \n\n            Breakfast and lunch, on the other hand, can be chaotic. The menu sprawls all over the place, although at its core it\u2019s not so different from\n            \n             Barney Greengrass\n            \n            \u2019s. It strikes almost everybody as overpriced. Servers can get confused as they jostle between small, overladen tables. Right in the middle of the dining room is a small glass cage where bakers work as if they were go-go dancers in white jackets. Every so often, someone will emerge from the cage with bagels stacked on a pole, shouting, \u201cHot bagels!\u201d like street vendors in a Lower East Side pavilion at Epcot.\n           \n\n            Yet the kitschy daytime clamor works, while Sadelle\u2019s stab at evening elegance hasn\u2019t come together yet. Open since September, Sadelle\u2019s is the first restaurant from the\n            \n             Major Food Group\n            \n            that doesn\u2019t feel completely worked out.\n           \n\n\n             Jeff Zalaznick, Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone\n            \n            , the men behind the restaurant group, first imagined Sadelle\u2019s as a bakery for Melissa Weller. Ms. Weller began experimenting with bagels when she worked at\n            \n             Per Se\n            \n            and later sold them in a stall at\n            \n             Smorgasburg\n            \n            . Starting with the premise that the New York bagel had metastasized into an overrisen, underbaked balloon of flabby dough with a bellybutton where its hole should be, Ms. Weller scaled back.\n           \n\n            Her bagels are palm size, rolled by hand, slowly risen for flavor, boiled and well baked to a chewy crackle. All the varieties are worthwhile \u2014 there\u2019s even a credible gluten-free bagel, no small feat \u2014 but my current favorite is the pumpernickel, made from rye and crushed caraway.\n           \n\n            Sit at a table for breakfast or lunch and order smoked fish, like the wonderful salmon that shines like the inside of a pink grapefruit, and two copies of your chosen bagel arrive on their own peg stand next to a crock of tangy cream cheese and a tower of garnishes. It\u2019s showy and silly, but it\u2019s great.\n           \n\n            The daytime menu used to offer a basket of some of Ms. Weller\u2019s finest work, including a slice of chocolate babka, some unusually tender rugelach and one of the best oatmeal cookies in existence. Now the basket is gone, replaced by Ms. Weller\u2019s sticky buns. These are phenomenal, swirls of laminated brioche dough under a brown-sugar glaze, but the baked goods sold at the retail counter up front deserve a whole category on the menu.\n           \n\n            It\u2019s as if Ms. Weller\u2019s partners don\u2019t quite realize what comes out of her ovens is more distinctive and memorable than what comes out of Deegan McClung\u2019s savory kitchen, and more consistently delicious, too.\n           \n\n            Everything about the matzo ball soup was likable, from the bits of chicken that tasted like chicken, not wrung-out stock fixings, to the golden broth swirled with dill to the single big, fluffy matzo ball. The tomato soup, though, was so acidic it was almost lacerating. A disc of softly cooked eggs and salami set over brown mustard, with crunchy fried shallots on top, had a terrific savory punch. But the grilled cheese \u2014 Muenster, American and Swiss on an everything bagel turned inside-out so the cut sides face the griddle \u2014 might have come out of a Betty Crocker children\u2019s cookbook. To me, it tasted like somebody else\u2019s nostalgia.\n           \n\n            At least it wasn\u2019t somebody else\u2019s order. We waited a long time before anyone asked what we wanted to eat. We waited some more before we were brought food meant for the people sitting next to us. More time passed, followed by another attempt to deliver the wrong food. The disarray increased when the right plates finally showed up and we tried to make room on the tiny table.\n           \n\n            Despite the disorder and the high prices, I\u2019d come back to daytime Sadelle\u2019s for fish, bagels and eggs. I\u2019m not sold yet on the after-dark version.\n           \n\n            Sadelle\u2019s makes a valiant effort to transform itself to a refined dinner destination from a busy appetizing restaurant. Liquor bottles replace bagels at the front counter. Fat candles flicker on the walls, and tall dripping tapers sit on the tables. The long marble slab of a communal table in the center of the room is set at night with flowers and cut-glass bowls that glint softly in the light cast by candelabras.\n           \n\n            It all looks provisional, though, like a loft hastily made over by caterers for a charity benefit. That impression is reinforced if you order the pigs in blankets, whose flaky pastry sheaths leave your fingers shiny with butter. They\u2019re out of place alongside sophisticated appetizers like vadouvan-sprinkled lobster in its shell or tight, icy oysters with pickle mignonette and splinters of horseradish.\n           \n\n            Butterflied trout with brown butter and shredded pickled beets suggests what Sadelle\u2019s could become if the kitchen really committed to suave Eastern European cuisine. So do the seared salmon steaks with a gently creamy mustard sauce and dill threads. Steak tartare, though, is slightly overthought, mixed with so many alliums that the flavor of the beef recedes. Chicken came with a lake of smoky paprika vinaigrette that turned a mound of kasha salad into a dripping, oily mess.\n           \n\n            It was hard to be unhappy spooning up dense, sticky clusters of Kaviari\u2019s Kristal sturgeon roe with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, chives and light, tender pancakes brushed with melted butter. It was also hard to imagine another occasion when I\u2019d pay $400 for the smallest serving, a 125-gram tin, let alone $1,950 for 500 grams of another variety.\n           \n\n            Not when bliss comes in simpler forms, like the pull-apart loaf of fantail bread, delivered warm before the appetizers, which reminded me that honey and black pepper are a great combination. Or the supremely moist ginger spice cake with juicy raisins and a slouching landslide of whipped cream. But why are there only three desserts?\n           \n\n            Whenever you go, the music is a peculiar distraction, an unimaginative collection of old songs by the same few artists, over and over. By day, it\u2019s Barbra Streisand, Neil Diamond, Billy Joel, Paul Simon. By night, more gentiles are invited, and we get Led Zeppelin, the Stones, Eric Clapton, Zeppelin again.\n           \n\n            This is a minor complaint that wouldn\u2019t register if Sadelle\u2019s were put together by anybody other than Major Food Group. As it is, Sadelle\u2019s is packed with more ideas and more good things to eat than we get from most other restaurants. But, like the average New York bagel, its growth needs to be reined in.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 204, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/dining/sadelles-review.html", "google_mag": 28.700000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n            Like many New Yorkers, I have convinced myself that a rickety fire escape platform is a terrace and that a segment of the Empire State Building\u2019s antenna seen through a sliver of window constitutes a panoramic skyline view.

He is the restaurant\u2019s third chef. With any luck, Mr. Ducasse won\u2019t need a fourth for a long time.\n           \n\n            The menu works like a season at the Metropolitan Opera. A core of preposterously old-fashioned classics is rounded out with a few modern compositions to keep everybody on their toes.\n           \n\n            To understand the point of keeping rafter-rattling war horses in the repertoire, all I had to do was eat Benoit\u2019s quenelles de brochet. These two little footballs of happiness are improbably smooth, almost but not quite fluffy, filled with the freshwater richness of pike. Each one is enveloped in a thick brown gravy of Nantua sauce that is 10 times richer, made from crayfish and lobster. I tasted it, and the whole chorus marched out on the stage at once, the orchestra pounding and the fat lady throwing her head back and letting it rip. A standing ovation would have followed if Benoit\u2019s quenelles hadn\u2019t made me feel a bit like the fat lady myself.\n           \n\n            Even more inimical to hopes of mobility was Mr. Bertineau\u2019s cassoulet. A gleefully debilitating arsenal of duck confit, duck sausage and cured pork, it is also a magnificent pot of tender baked beans soaked in garlic and fat. Either the meat or the beans could slow your speed. Together they act like an anchor.\n           \n\n            The calf\u2019s liver, an oblong lobe shaped like Argentina, was seared to a dark gold in the copper saut\u00e9 pan that escorted it to the table. A step beyond the medium-rare the server had suggested, it was still very good. It had no overcooked livery flavor, just the ripe tang of organ meat that dissolved into very soft Lyonnaise potatoes and onions.\n           \n\n            To begin, there is darkly concentrated onion soup, choked with melted Gruy\u00e8re that seems never to run out. Snails in the divots of a heavy glazed dish have a wafer of parsley crust on top that\u2019s almost as fun to eat as a rag of bread dunked in their garlic butter.\n           \n\n            Obviously, like so much of Benoit\u2019s menu, these appetizers predate the electrocardiogram. It is possible to start with something lighter. Regulars often tick off choices on the hors d\u2019oeuvres list, a separate sheet of paper that comes with a golf pencil: a poached and oil-marinated sardine; crisp sticks of celery root in r\u00e9moulade that may need more mustard; ham with flageolets and a handful of other dried beans, each cooked until just tender; the egg mayo, on the menu since opening day. Five of these little dishes served together make an excellent $19 lunch, a kind of Lyonnaise bento box.\n           \n\n            The greatest bistros in France are magnetic because they are invariable; you know the classics will be made the same way they were 15 or 45 years ago. Benoit is not always this kind of bistro, though this may be a symptom of its distance from Lyon. The p\u00e2t\u00e9 en cro\u00fbte, from an 1892 recipe, can be dry and underseasoned. The filet mignon au poivre can be dullish, although the pepper-cream sauce puts up a strong fight.\n           \n\n            In compensation, though, Mr. Bertineau cooks almost as well outside the bistro canon as inside it. He shows this with seafood especially.\n           \n\n            One night, my guests, elbow deep in a wild boar stew, threw me looks of pity: poor guy, stuck with king salmon, butternut squash and black-trumpet mushrooms. I didn\u2019t let on, but I was perfectly content. The fish, roasted gently, was crazily tender and the white-wine sauce so appealing that I spooned way more than I needed from the sauceboat left on the table. (The right French sauce can be a dish in itself.)\n           \n\n            The baba is not as spectacular at it was at Alain Ducasse New York before that restaurant closed. The cake\u2019s halves can be too sober, depending on whether the server applies the Armagnac as if he\u2019s putting out a house fire or baptizing a baby. But other vintage desserts can restore the faith of any New Yorker who\u2019s been brought down by bland mille-feuilles or watery cr\u00e8me caramels or confused tarte Tatins.\n           \n\n            The servers on my recent visits showed no impatience with lingerers; they simply went about their business with that straight-spined, matter-of-fact French-waiter style. This is sometimes mistaken for rudeness but is closer to pride and a confidence that everybody, including the customers, knows how to act.\n           \n\n            It\u2019s strange that it took Mr. Ducasse to give New York its most convincing version of this very un-cheflike style of cooking. That a highly traditional bistro survived while the other, more inventive restaurants with which he hoped to conquer Manhattan did not is peculiar, too \u2014 a missed opportunity for the chef and New Yorkers, who love French food even when it doesn\u2019t love them back.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 205, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/03/dining/benoit-review.html", "google_mag": 23.200000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n            Yes, the apples are still there.\n            \n             Hundreds of them\n            \n            , lining shelf after shelf in\n            \n             Bouley\n            \n            \u2019s first room, the small one with the coat closet. Going soft under the skin, ripening, giving up the yeasty cider-mash smell you meet in orchard barns. As far back as 1987, when he opened the original Bouley on the other side of Hudson Street in TriBeCa, David Bouley has wanted that scent inside your head the minute you walked in.\n           \n\n            Yes, the trick works. Before your mind has time to doubt, your senses are leading you.\n           \n\n            Yes, the restaurant is trying to seduce you. There\u2019s no other explanation for the gold leaf on the groin-vaulted ceiling or the crushed velour just about everywhere \u2014 on the curtains, the banquettes, the frame around a softly radiant field of lavender in an enormous painting. There\u2019s even a velour armchair next to a toilet in the men\u2019s room downstairs. It must be there in case you have brought along an especially devoted valet.\n           \n\n            Yes, it\u2019s faintly silly. But there\u2019s also visual joy in the baronial curves of the limestone fireplace and the patterns woven into the antique rug. This is a restaurant for romantics and sensualists, just the place to take my friend who collects Victorian jewelry and mounted butterflies, the one who will smile when she sees the Chartreuse prominently shelved with the other after-dinner drinks.\n           \n\n            No, Bouley is not trendy. Mr. Bouley doesn\u2019t even seem aware that trends exist apart from those shooting through his own mind, of which there are more than anyone can count. Occasionally, these overlap with trends in the world outside. This is the case with his interest in gluten-free bread, as evidenced by two dense loaves that ride around on a wooden chariot with at least a dozen other proprietary breads. Typically, gluten-free bread in restaurants is, like margarine, a barely credible substitute. These two bricks at Bouley, on the other hand, reflect creativity, experimentation, maybe a shade of obsession.\n           \n\n            Yes, they\u2019re delicious. The black one is a little salty, earthy from buckwheat, crackling with walnuts, reminiscent of the seeded health breads of northern Europe, and wonderful as toast. The white one is a little sweet and speckled green with pistachios, slightly tropical-tasting from the coconut fiber that helps hold it together.\n           \n\n            Yes, you can eat bread with wheat flour instead: get a slice of the dried cherry or the saffron-walnut loaves, press some cultured Norman butter across it. That would be delicious, too. But these two bricks, their mere existence and their distinctiveness, tell you a lot about what makes Bouley compelling. Mr. Bouley takes paths nobody else is on, and walks farther along them than anybody else would.\n           \n\n            No, I\u2019m not opposed to refined sugar and heavy cream the way he is. When servers murmur that the desserts use only coconut-palm sugar for its \u201clow glycemic index,\u201d it doesn\u2019t particularly turn me on. I don\u2019t really care that the slouching white slab of powdered snow that appears before dessert won\u2019t give me diabetes, although customers who already have diabetes are no doubt appreciative.\n           \n\n            No, what I care about is the way it melts on my tongue: so fast the cold barely registers before there\u2019s nothing but a cool trace of skim milk sweetened with white chocolate. It\u2019s an impression, no more than that, like sticking out your tongue in a snowstorm and catching a few flakes.\n           \n\n            No, neither the bread nor the milk fluff is on the menu. They simply appear, along with other surprises that make the cost of a three-course menu, $125, seem eminently fair. But they illustrate a key facet of Mr. Bouley\u2019s cooking: By ruling out some ingredients for reasons of health or digestion, he forces himself to find new ways to whip up delight and a sense of luxury.\n           \n\n            True, it\u2019s not all dreamy. Buffalo fillet was served with a nondescript sauce and bland, lumpy gluten-free gnocchi. The \u201cchocolate frivolous\u201d dessert, a mainstay for many years, seemed worn out one night, the warm chocolate cake in the middle of the plate filled with a strangely bitter and oily ooze. A tart of apples and black olives was more provocative than delicious.\n           \n\n            O.K., meals can last longer than they need to. Servers can forget who ordered what, or present a wine bottle to the wrong person. And I wish more women worked in Bouley\u2019s dining room; the gender imbalance there is old-fashioned in the wrong way.\n           \n\n            Yes, but it gets much, much better.\n           \n\n            For sure, the most dramatic dish in New York is the Malibu sea urchin in its spiky shell that looks like a medieval torture device. Inside is a layered composition of almond and soy milk; tofu; soy and vinegar; yuzu jelly and bursting orbs of salmon trout roe; creamy tongues of sea urchin under yuzu sorbet; and an olive-green spoonful of golden osetra caviar. Swooshed around it all is a puckering froth of green apple juice. Each bite is exciting in a different way.\n           \n\n            Yes, the wild mushrooms in the \u201cforager\u2019s treasure\u201d were so richly flavored they fooled me into thinking they were cooked in butter. With melting lobes of grilled tuna belly, a truffle sauce and a light coconut garlic broth, the dish sent me to some other world in a whoosh.\n           \n\n            All right, I should have learned, but I was tricked again by the lushness of the \u201cocean herbal broth\u201d pooled around gorgeously fresh shrimp, scallops, a belon oyster and a bundle of sea cucumber cut into ribbons. No butter in this dish either, just pur\u00e9ed garlic and other aromatics with tomato water and the sweet brine that drips from shucked clams.\n           \n\n            No, the rabbit salad \u2014 juicy loin wrapped in crisped belly with inky poached prunes and foie gras \u2014 is nothing like a salad. It is a warm appetizer that would be one of the star main courses in another restaurant.\n           \n\n            Yes, chicken baked in a sealed pot over hay and alfalfa sounds like punishment. It is not. As fowl cookery goes, it is something close to perfection.\n           \n\n            Yes, perfection. Bouley can skim within sight of it on the right night with the right people. At other times, it\u2019s clear that the restaurant can\u2019t maintain a single-minded focus on doing absolutely everything right. Eccentricity and consistency don\u2019t always get along, and Bouley is a slightly eccentric restaurant, as\n            \n             Frank Bruni noted\n            \n            the last time it was reviewed in The New York Times, in 2009. He thought it was a three-star restaurant.\n           \n\n            Yes, so do I.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 206, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/dining/bouley-restaurant-review.html", "google_mag": 29.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n            I was having my second Frogasm of the night when dinner got weird.\n           \n\n            Not that this or any other night at\n            \n             Se\u00f1or Frog\u2019s\n            \n            in Times Square was ever fully conventional. In point of fact, I had already danced in a conga line wearing a three-foot-high crown of yellow and orange balloons that made me look like Simba in a production of \u201cThe Lion King\u201d staged by balloon animals.\n           \n\n            In further point of fact, I had also eaten a foot-long chili dog presented on a skateboard. Consider, too, that outside Se\u00f1or Frog\u2019s I had passed a sign promising that \u201cDrinks go in, fun comes out!\u201d (If nothing else, I was looking forward to seeing the restrooms.) The drink that was going in, a deviant margarita, came in a plastic cup that had a long, thrusting, curved, ridged shaft, ostensibly modeled on the trunk of a palm tree but impossible to grasp without thinking: \u201cribbed for her pleasure.\u201d\n           \n\n            Still, total weirdness didn\u2019t kick in until the ice cream truck parade. It began with an air-raid siren followed by a loudspeaker announcement: \u201cAll Se\u00f1or Frog\u2019s staff report to the kitchen!\u201d We had said we were celebrating a birthday. (A lie.)\n           \n\n            Employees began marching across the stage, blowing whistles and waving glowsticks. Others were bearing aloft two ice cream trucks, each the size of a picnic cooler.\n           \n\n            Then a server in a light-up Santa cap stood on our table and sang, along with his colleagues, \u201cFroggy, froggy birthday. Na-na-na-na-na. This is how we do it. Na-na-na-na-na.\u201d (Another verse is sometimes added when it\u2019s time to eat the cake: \u201cPut it in your mouth, put it in your mouth.\u201d)\n           \n\n            What happened next was captured in a fast-moving video that, like the Zapruder film, I have watched dozens of times. There is a piece of paper on a stick planted in a birthday cake. Then it is on fire. The birthday boy tries to blow it out. He fails. A powerful wind comes out of nowhere. It raises sparks from the fire. The birthday boy\u2019s balloon hat starts to tremble, then shoots straight up in the air like an Apollo rocket. It hits the ceiling. Chaos reigns.\n           \n\n            Many thoughts went through my head at that moment. I wondered, briefly, why anyone trusted me with an expense account. But the dominant idea was: Se\u00f1or Frog\u2019s, where have you been all my life?\n           \n\n            I came to Se\u00f1or Frog\u2019s later than most of its customers. Founded in Mexico in 1969, the chain thrives in Caribbean beach towns and caters to college students on spring break who will fake orgasms on stage to win a margarita. I wasn\u2019t one of them. My most memorable spring break was whiled away in my room reading \u201cThe Sorrows of Young Werther\u201d in German.\n           \n\n            This did not get me invited to many orgasm contests, but I was inclined to think the time with Goethe had been well spent until Se\u00f1or Frog\u2019s opened on 42nd Street last summer. For the first time, I wished I had some memories of the chain. So when I ate there, I brought people who had gone to Se\u00f1or Frog\u2019s in their wilder years. Unfortunately, none of them recalled anything about it, either. One volunteered that he had climbed onto a giant speaker at the Canc\u00fan branch and danced furiously, a fact he knows only because witnesses later told him about it.\n           \n\n            \u201cI think I went on a water slide,\u201d said a woman who had also unwound in Canc\u00fan. \u201cBut I can\u2019t remember where it ended.\u201d\n           \n\n            \u201cIn jail,\u201d her husband said.\n           \n\n            There is no water slide at the Times Square location, which offers a more sober and family-friendly version of the Frog experience. (\u201cDo not show underwear,\u201d the dress code posted at the door warns.) In early evening the place is filled with children, like the two who got up to sing \u201cLet It Go\u201d and gamely karaoked away when a blizzard of confetti snow erupted from the foot of the stage.\n           \n\n            Later the crowd got older, with more New Yorkers and fewer tourists than I had expected. Cocktails in embarrassing palm-tree vessels abounded, but I never saw anybody get really tanked, myself included, even after multiple Frogasms. All the mixed drinks seemed tame, and the shot that a server squirted into my open mouth when I hopped by in the conga line tasted like orange Gatorade.\n           \n\n            Se\u00f1or Frog\u2019s is not a good restaurant by most conventional measures, including the fairly basic one of serving food. One night I got just two of the half-dozen appetizers I had asked for. Another time, the starters showed up on schedule, but after nearly two hours the main courses still had not appeared.\n           \n\n            \u201cWhat happened to our food?\u201d we finally asked.\n           \n\n            \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m wondering!\u201d our server said brightly. \u201cLike, where is it?\u201d\n           \n\n            Getting just half of what you order at Se\u00f1or Frog\u2019s can be a blessing if it\u2019s the right half. The chili, rich and chocolate-brown, does just what you want it to do for the thick, juicy hot dog or the nachos, whose chips were flaccid one night but crunchy another. Honey-sriracha wings, which ping-pong between sweet and spicy, are preferable to the Buffalo wings, which taste like a mild case of acid reflux.\n           \n\n            The ribs meet chain-restaurant standards, and so does the pulled pork sandwich once you scrape off the questionable coleslaw. You can get far worse guacamole at far more serious restaurants. (All other restaurants are more serious than Se\u00f1or Frog\u2019s.)\n           \n\n            The Reuben is good, for some reason.\n           \n\n            Most other things I tried may as well have stayed in the kitchen, except the chicken enchiladas, which should have been sent back to Canc\u00fan. I thought they tasted like tuna, but a more acute observer said the flavor was like pork sprinkled with fish food.\n           \n\n            But \u2026 here, hold my Frogasm, I need to stand on the speakers and dance. Because I had more fun at Se\u00f1or Frog\u2019s than at almost any other restaurant that has opened in the last few years.\n           \n\n            True, it\u2019s a particular kind of fun: compulsory hilarity, scheduled spontaneity, a scripted theater of the inane with random outbreaks of mediocre Tex-Mex. Se\u00f1or Frog\u2019s brand of fun is so mindless that it\u2019s embarrassing to give in to at first, but eventually everybody I brought there did give in, maybe because we\u2019re all so desperate to let go a little bit.\n           \n\n            In the 1980s and \u201990s it was a clich\u00e9 to say restaurants had become theater. Hardly anyone says that now, because it\u2019s not true anymore. A few chefs and restaurateurs still understand that people go out to have a good time;\n            \n             Daniel Humm\n            \n            would serve a chili dog on a skateboard if he had thought of it first. But too many restaurants have become church without the singing and costumes.\n           \n\n            The next time you\u2019re in one of those places, try starting a conga line. If you\u2019re asked to leave, there\u2019s a place in Times Square that\u2019s ready to welcome you as long as you keep your underwear out of sight.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 207, "rating": "Fair", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/dining/senor-frogs-review.html", "google_mag": 25.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n            In the hedonist\u2019s view of American immigration patterns, bad times for chefs in China are good times for dumpling chasers and noodle hunters in New York. When experienced cooks couldn\u2019t make a living there for political or economic reasons, they came here. Conversely, over the last decade or so, the hypertrophic Chinese economy has left the kitchens of our Chinatowns somewhat flattened, with fewer high peaks of talent standing out in the landscape.\n           \n\n            But a cash-flush China may be working to the advantage of New Yorkers for once. An energetic entrepreneur named Zhu Rong, who owns restaurants in four cities around China, recently expanded her territory to Greenwich Village with a place she has named (take a breath)\n            \n             Hao Noodle and Tea by Madam Zhu\u2019s Kitchen\n            \n            (exhale). Ms. Zhu brought along a pair of chefs whose skillful manipulation of bubbling oil, steam and smoking-hot woks is evident in almost everything they cook. They also know a thing or two about dough and hot peppers.\n           \n\n            The traditions invoked by the menu come mainly from Beijing, Shanghai and Ms. Zhu\u2019s hometown, Chongqing. The interpretations are contemporary. The portions are generally bigger than a street snack but smaller than one of those platters that descends with a thunk on the Lazy Susans of Chinatown. The food is sometimes arranged with an attention to negative space that can make you wish you saw less plate and more food. Balancing any spareness, though, are the spicy intensity of some dishes and the stripped-down purity of others.\n           \n\n            The chefs are virtuosic fryers, able to express many nuances in the simple language of crust. The coating on the fish fritters is almost as soft as cake crumbs, a pale gold tinted green by seaweed powder. It\u2019s a subtle partner for the delicate fish inside.\n           \n\n            Crispy shrimp saut\u00e9 has a more rugged crunch, almost in fried chicken territory, with dark, thrilling slips of dried chiles clinging to it. Between the two extremes are the wonderful cubes of creamy tofu inside a crisp and ultrathin shell; they\u2019re like mozzarella sticks refined to the nth degree.\n           \n\n            Everything on the menu\u2019s many pages gets a color photo, and it all looks good. Mostly, it is. Lunch or dinner might start with chilled appetizers like the fresh and tender clams in a stack of quietly seasoned Chinese chives; or the juicy smoked sole, marinated in sweet soy sauce. Both were exceptional. So was the chilled salad of poached grape tomatoes. Fizzy on the inside and infused with plum syrup, they were a quick respite from the weather on a muggy summer day.\n           \n\n            Cold sliced beef shank, a Sichuan notion, pulled its punches on the night I tried it. But other cold appetizers from that region, like the translucent logs of mung bean jelly stacked up under a chile and fermented black bean sauce, landed all the expected body blows and uppercuts. There are excellent wood ear mushrooms, floppy and crisp at the same time in their dressing of vinegar and a dose of chile oil that will sneak up on the unwary.\n           \n\n            The more familiar dishes are some of the least interesting. Sweet and sour pork with pineapple was less sugary than usual, but I still left it alone. Seafood pancakes are tough and oily triangles that lack the tender layering that makes scallion pancakes so appealing. Something called rainbow salad is a plate of quinoa and carrots that you\u2019d be happy enough to find at the company cafeteria.\n           \n\n            All danger of dullness is obliterated, though, when Madam Zhu\u2019s Spicy Fish Stew shows up. It\u2019s a Sichuanese inspiration, with a flaky fish in a lightly sour green broth so packed with fresh chiles that it brought all conversation, not to mention rational thought, to a standstill.\n           \n\n            The noodles and dumplings are toward the back of the menu, and tend to arrive near the meal\u2019s end. The bacon sticky rice shumai, sheer wrappers that barely contain their stuffing, have instantly entered New York\u2019s gallery of great dim sum. Everybody at my table marveled, too, at the half-moons called clay pot dumplings: These tender wrappers of cooked egg folded over pork and water chestnuts are something like omelets crossed with pierogies that moved into a bowl of soup.\n           \n\n            The only part of the menu I found unreliable was, oddly enough, the noodles. On a night when the restaurant was at full capacity, the Taiwanese pork noodles were monotonously sweet, and the dan dan noodles were an unfocused blur. But they and other dishes \u2014 there\u2019s a fascinating and novel bowl of fresh tomato soup with ragged hand-pulled flat noodles and gingery pork meatballs \u2014 were excellent on slower days. I wondered if the kitchen had simply been moving too quickly.\n           \n\n            To gloss one of the eight words in the restaurant\u2019s name: The tea is very good. There is delicate silver needle and white peony, pungently herbal green tea grown at high elevations, and a fine aged oolong, among others. The servers never seem to suggest tea, but once you order it they do remember to refresh your pot with hot water until the leaves have given all they\u2019ve got.\n           \n\n            Ms. Zhu is a refugee from the art gallery business and she brings an airy, creative aesthetic to her restaurants. With framed prints of\n            \n             Arne Svenson\n            \n            \u2019s window-peeping photography on the walls and a long, rough-grained communal table in the center of the room, Hao Noodle and Tea looks like an especially nice Brooklyn espresso bar where the rapture has arrived and taken only the laptops. There is enough space between the white tables and chairs to drive a riding lawn mower.\n           \n\n            Even the people at my table who are normally unmoved by Chinese sweets were impressed by the desserts. Slippery, cool taro soup was soothingly bland, which is no put-down. The rosewater jelly was the real surprise, broken into shards as sparklingly clear as cold vodka.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.30000001192092896, "id": 208, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/dining/hao-noodle-and-tea-by-madam-zhus-kitchen-review.html", "google_mag": 26.5}, {"review_text": "\n            Long before it turned 22 last month,\n            \n             Gramercy Tavern\n            \n            had settled into classic status. It is a classic, but there\u2019s a downside to putting a restaurant in that category. The more familiar something is, the harder it is to see.\n           \n\n            Like the other restaurants in Danny Meyer\u2019s\n            \n             Union Square Hospitality Group\n            \n            , Gramercy Tavern is virtually synonymous with a certain style of service. Cheerful, wholesome, engaging, proactive, the servers are the sort you\u2019d be comfortable leaving young children with. (Mr. Meyer could run a great babysitting company.) Whether we walk into the easygoing front tavern or reserve a table in the more expensive and ceremonious dining room in the back, we take for granted that the service will be very good.\n           \n\n            When that\u2019s all it is, and if we forget that Gramercy Tavern on a very good night is still better than most restaurants when they try their hardest, it\u2019s possible to be mildly disappointed. The staff seems to understand that high expectations work against the place, though, and sometimes you can be treated to next-level hospitality.\n           \n\n            One recent night, our table had interrupted the march from main courses to desserts by sharing a small cheese plate. A cheese interruption is never a bad idea at Gramercy Tavern.\n           \n\n            What I really went wild for, though, was a simple condiment that arrived with the cheeses, a little dish of sour-cherry preserves. I ate it on a wedge of aged goat, I ate it on crackers, and after they were gone, I dropped red jam onto my finger from a spoon and slipped the finger into my mouth.\n           \n\n            To make space for the desserts, the cheese plate was soon cleared away. Not the jam dish, though, because I had covered it with my hand and smiled in a way that said, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to kill me first.\u201d\n           \n\n            This being Gramercy Tavern, I knew I\u2019d win without a fight. But I didn\u2019t expect a manager to swing by a few minutes later and say: \u201cI told Miro how much you enjoyed the cherry jam, and he was thrilled. It\u2019s his grandmother\u2019s recipe, from Serbia, and he loves making it.\u201d\n           \n\n            As if by magic, my piggishness had been turned into a compliment to the pastry chef, Miro Uskokovic, and my happiness had become the restaurant\u2019s. This is what\u2019s meant by the clich\u00e9 \u201cIt\u2019s our pleasure to serve you.\u201d But it takes in-the-moment intelligence to bring that phrase to life. Gramercy Tavern can do that.\n           \n\n            Maybe I paid a little more attention to Mr. Uskokovic\u2019s desserts from then on, noticing how gingered pineapple and crumbled pralines brightened the wonderful carrot cake, appreciating the innocent sweetness that angel food croutons brought to a cheesecake topped with dark, soft strawberries. Maybe I also enjoyed the desserts more because I was in a good mood. They had the openness and generosity of spirit that\n            \n             I\u2019d admired at Untitled\n            \n            , where Mr. Uskokovic is also the pastry chef.\n           \n\n            The executive chef at both restaurants is Michael Anthony. In 2006, he took over at Gramercy Tavern from Tom Colicchio, who had run the kitchen from the beginning.\n           \n\n            As the torch passed, it sputtered. In\n            \n             Gramercy Tavern\u2019s last review in The Times\n            \n            , nine years ago, Frank Bruni wrote about \u201cforgettable\u201d meals at the end of Mr. Colicchio\u2019s tenure and a \u201cclumsy, laughable one\u201d at the start of Mr. Anthony\u2019s.\n           \n\n            The new team finally hit its stride, and Mr. Bruni\u2019s appraisal carried three stars. But the kitchen\u2019s sensibility changed much more significantly than a restaurant trying to remain classic would normally allow.\n           \n\n            Where Mr. Colicchio would often focus on a star ingredient, Mr. Anthony\u2019s dishes tend to be ensemble efforts. It\u2019s as if he has fallen in love with everything he puts on the plate. He\u2019s like somebody who goes to the farmers\u2019 market hungry, ends up buying everything he sees, then figures out a way to make it all come together.\n           \n\n            A bin of small hot red peppers must have jumped into his shopping bag in early August, when he made them into an unusually forceful and perfectly harmonious foil for corn and very tender poached lobster. What to do with red currants, so pretty and so resistant to the spotlight? Mr. Anthony scattered them over a chilled marigold-yellow soup of summer squash, which needed their jolt of juicy tartness.\n           \n\n            Mr. Anthony\u2019s keen sense of what to do with produce was on full display in the $110 vegetable tasting menu, of course. But I also saw it in the $125 tasting, where blackberries helped out a braised pork shoulder paved with crackling hazelnuts and where a supple hunk of halibut sat over warm summer tomatoes given a briny, oceanic intensity by scraps of kombu. Even over three courses at a fixed price of $98, Mr. Anthony gives you a sense of what\u2019s going on that week in the vegetable patch that few chefs can match.\n           \n\n            These are the menus offered in the back dining room. But the keen responsiveness to the season still comes across if you order \u00e0 la carte at the long, perennially busy bar or one of the tables next to it. I loved the taste of corn kernels and green tomatoes, sliced into see-through wheels, on a flatbread dotted with lamb sausage, and the way Mr. Anthony made room for cool peaches in a tomato-basil salad.\n           \n\n            For the Tavern\u2019s dessert menu, Mr. Uskokovic bakes a pie that has pastry-crust stars on top of a dark field of wild blueberries \u2014 an edible flag. It would be hokey if it weren\u2019t so good.\n           \n\n            The barroom is more than a low-priced alternative; it\u2019s integral to the restaurant\u2019s personality. For example, it sets the tone for the way people drink in both rooms. Gramercy Tavern\u2019s wine list is justly celebrated for its catholic embrace of diverse regions and styles, but how many other restaurants make cider or a glass of beer (on draft or from one of the vintage bottles) seem like a natural choice with a dinner that costs $100 or more?\n           \n\n            Although it\u2019s not as plush as the dining room, the tavern is more attractive. The colors of the fruits and vegetables in Robert Kushner\u2019s scrolling mural above the bar still leap out at you after all these years. In the back rooms, the collision of Italianate arcades and ye olde timbered beams is more clearly a pastiche than it once seemed.\n           \n\n            The appeal of Gramercy Tavern transcends design, though. It springs from a sense of trustworthiness that is kept vital by acts of imagination like the manager\u2019s report about the cherry jam and Mr. Anthony\u2019s constant adjustments to the season.\n           \n\n            You can tell that people value that combination if you study the clothes they wear to eat in the front room. With a wait for tables that may be right next to the crowd at the bar, the setup there is not too different from\n            \n             the Spotted Pig\n            \n            \u2019s, but most dress as if they were going to one of the nicest restaurants in New York.

What sets New York\u2019s restaurant culture apart is that it never quite shakes the past and has never fully severed its ties to Europe.\n           \n\n            This is why New York can seem to be stuck in the last century, but it also explains its unusual receptivity to news from across the Atlantic. (No American city has been as fast to take up natural wines or\n            \n             the New Nordic mode\n            \n            .) With\n            \n             Le Coucou\n            \n            , this attention to Europe and attachment to the past come together in ways that are creative and fresh.\n           \n\n            The chef,\n            \n             Daniel Rose\n            \n            , runs a restaurant in Paris called\n            \n             Spring\n            \n            , but he\u2019s from Chicago. He has said that his old-guard French menu is meant in part as a homage to Lut\u00e8ce, a restaurant in Manhattan that he never visited. (\n            \n             It closed 12 years ago.\n            \n            ) In other words, a chef who knows a lot about what actual French people are eating in 2016 has decided to summon a long-closed Manhattan restaurant that gave many Americans their ideas about French cuisine in the last four decades of the 20th century.\n           \n\n            This idea would make no sense anywhere but New York. It may not make sense here, either, but of all the restaurants to open in the city over the last year, Le Coucou would be my first pick for visitors from out of town who wanted a meal they couldn\u2019t have back home.\n           \n\n            Not that it\u2019s a tourist restaurant. Locals have been pouring through the doors at the south end of Lafayette Street since they opened, in the last week of spring, and reservations are scarce unless you want to eat before 6 p.m. or after 9:30. A lot of the love is due to Mr. Rose\u2019s decision to bring back the long-gone high style of French cuisine.\n           \n\n            At Spring, his first restaurant in Paris, he put market produce in the foreground, following the seasons and his own contemporary impulses. Le Coucou\u2019s cooking is more informed by old-school traditions and focused on animal parts, like the bands of fried tripe, crunchy on the outside and wonderfully creamy within. Or the eel fried in a sheath of rye batter, sauced with a vinaigrette that has a subtle and somehow very French flavor of curry.\n           \n\n            Much of the cooking revolves around glossy, spoon-coating, cream- and butter-reinforced sauces that some younger diners have never tasted. These sauces aren\u2019t remotely heavy or deadening, two of the charges hurled at them when they were led to the guillotines by the Robespierres of nouvelle cuisine.\n           \n\n            In fact, they are so dynamic, the contours of their flavors so precise and rewarding, that smart diners lick the sauces from the heavy, scrolled, silver-plated tablespoon set to the right of the gold-rimmed plates, waiting for just this purpose.\n           \n\n            When the bourride arrived, I used the tablespoon to drink the shellfish fumet that a server had ladled from a copper saut\u00e9 pan over a fillet of black sea bass in a soup bowl. I used it again to stir the smooth yellow aioli into the fumet, and again to taste the garlic-ridden aioli on its own. There were clams and a prawn in the saut\u00e9 pan, too, and they were excellent. But the body and balance of the fumet were so right that it became the point of the dish; the shellfish were mere pretext.\n           \n\n            It\u2019s no accident that after Americans swore off rich sauces, they began to hunger for fatty cuts like pork butt and rib-eye. But you can see the point of the old high style when you eat Le Coucou\u2019s beef filet. The lean, rosy slices taste pure and clean; the decadence is supplied by ovals of soft beef marrow and by the marrow jus spooned over the meat.\n           \n\n            A side dish that comes with the beef is a rare mismatch: thin, crunchy slices of potatoes boulang\u00e8re that don\u2019t absorb the juices of the braised oxtail underneath.\n           \n\n            A bulging lobe of sweetbreads, scored with a knife and seared in a pan, is wonderful with its surrounding sauce, but you will also want to get some of that lively union of cream, white wine, tomatoes and fresh, minty tarragon on its own. You\u2019ll also need to taste the brandy and lobster in the foamy sauce Am\u00e9ricaine both with and without the delicate white mound of a pike quenelle.\n           \n\n            After eating that dish, a Francophile friend pronounced, \u201cDowntown finally has its\n            \n             La Grenouille\n            \n            .\u201d True enough, but I\u2019d add that the food coming out of Le Coucou\u2019s kitchen is more focused, the ingredients are finer, and the service is more tuned in. As for the wine list constructed by Aaron Thorp, it is better in every way you can name.\n           \n\n            Mr. Rose and his partner,\n            \n             Stephen Starr\n            \n            , allow themselves a couple of stagy visual references to those old French restaurants. The menu is written in French, although there are English subtitles. The cooks all wear tall white toques, and for many customers, Le Coucou will probably be the first place they\u2019ve seen that piece of headgear outside children\u2019s books.\n           \n\n            For the most part, though, Le Coucou carefully avoids the things that people found intimidating about the old Le and La restaurants. Mr. Rose wears a black shirt and no toque; his modern outfit sets the tone for the dining room.\n           \n\n            To the right of the front door is an intimate, soft-focus cocktail alcove that doubles as a waiting area. There are no seats at the bar, which is too bad if you want to eat by yourself, but which also gives the room a little bit of romance. The space opens up as you enter the dining room, with chandeliers that look like concentric rings of votive candles suspended above the white tablecloths, each of which is set with a single white taper.\n           \n\n            What Le Coucou achieves in its look and feel is impressive. It has an elegance that is well outside the everyday rumble of New York life but that doesn\u2019t have any of the heaviness in d\u00e9cor or the off-putting reserve that nobody really misses from the old days.\n           \n\n            The only place where Le Coucou falls slightly on the wrong side of the line between casual and formal is in Daniel Skurnick\u2019s desserts. They\u2019re lovely, but some seem too relaxed after the rigorously elegant main courses.\n           \n\n            There\u2019s a roasted pear stuffed with vanilla ice cream standing gracefully upright amid candied almonds, the golden folds of its skin clinging to it like a silk shawl. But other desserts, like the rice pudding with chopped pistachios or the chocolate mousse under leafy chocolate shavings, have a slouching, stuff-in-a-bowl informality that seems to belong in a wine bar. (A wine-bar annex to Le Coucou isn\u2019t a bad idea, by the way.)\n           \n\n            One night, I sat next to two Parisian women who said they were regulars at Spring. A French-speaking waiter appeared and engaged them in a long deliberation about the cheese course. They sent over their cheese, we shared our desserts, and then I slipped outside with them while they lit up their Gauloises.\n           \n\n            \u201cThis is very different from Spring,\u201d one said. \u201cBut it makes sense in New York.\u201d\n           \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 210, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/02/dining/le-coucou-review.html", "google_mag": 27.299999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n            If you heard that\n            \n             Chumley\u2019s\n            \n            is open again, you were misinformed. The dim, spare, beer-scented hideaway in the West Village is gone, torn down, not coming back. At its old address is a restaurant that has nothing in common with the original except a name, a door, an archway and framed photographs of, and jackets of books by, writers who used to drink there. Most of them wouldn\u2019t be able to afford a cocktail there now, let alone dinner.\n           \n\n            Chumley\u2019s first quietly and selectively opened its unmarked door, inside a hidden courtyard at the end of an alley, during Prohibition. Flappers, sailors, actors, Wobblies, writers heading for fame and bohemians heading for nowhere ate and drank in its windowless rooms. Simone de Beauvoir, who tumbled into Chumley\u2019s in the 1950s on a tip from Richard Wright, wrote that it was \u201cutterly simple, with its little tables lined against the walls, but it has something so rare in America \u2014 atmosphere.\u201d\n           \n\n            On busy nights in later years, the atmosphere could be like that of a college rathskeller in a state with a low drinking age. But if you caught Chumley\u2019s at the right hour, when there were empty booths and a log burning in the fireplace, it could be a shelter from the city and an ideal embodiment of it at the same time.\n           \n\n            All this time, the building, almost a century old when Chumley\u2019s opened, was falling apart \u2014 slowly at first and then, in 2007, in a landslide of bricks. It was so far gone that it had to be torn down and\n            \n             rebuilt\n            \n            . The work went so slowly that Chumley\u2019s nearly lost its chance to renew its liquor license.\n           \n\n            Then Alessandro Borgognone, who owns\n            \n             Sushi Nakazawa\n            \n            around the corner, was made a partner in the business; he must have hit the construction crew with a dose of wasabi, because the build-out zoomed along, the liquor license came through just in time, and the restaurant began serving in October.\n           \n\n            The chef is\n            \n             Victoria Blamey\n            \n            , who has cooked under\n            \n             Paul Liebrandt\n            \n            ,\n            \n             Matthew Lightner\n            \n            and\n            \n             Justin Smillie\n            \n            .\n            \n             Her menu\n            \n            has far-flung influences \u2014 the old regulars would have taken one look at it and called for another shot \u2014 but she doesn\u2019t let the dishes get wispy or abstract. Some of them even look like bar food, sort of. And she loads them with more excitement than you\u2019ll come across in other new restaurants that are getting far more attention.\n           \n\n            Starting with a warm pretzel and French onion dip, you first notice just how light the pretzel is. It is to the street-cart variety what a hummingbird is to a Butterball turkey. The crust is salt-flecked and rough with toasted onion powder. Orange dots of salmon roe sit on top of the dip, which tastes pure and chemical free \u2014 cooked garlic and shallots and onions are stirred into a base of soft cream cheese, cloumage and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.\n           \n\n            Chumley\u2019s beef tartare goes a few places other tartares don\u2019t. Instead of mustard and capers, it takes its sharpness from confit tomatoes and gratings of a sheep\u2019s milk cheese from Catalonia. It\u2019s meant to be spread on a wavy, blistered puff of fried beef tendon. Crunchier and airier than a cracker, the tendon has a very clean flavor and doesn\u2019t soak up the taste of raw steak the way toast does.\n           \n\n            There is a terrine that would be right at home in one of those casually excellent bistros run by young chefs in Paris. Foie gras and shredded ham hock are pressed between leaves of savoy cabbage; the cross section you get on a vintage china plate is served with a tart, fruity puddle of apple cider reduced to a gastrique. It\u2019s radically simple, and makes something memorable out of ham hocks and cabbage. (To be fair, the foie gras does its part, too.)\n           \n\n            New York may not need another burger, but any place called Chumley\u2019s definitely does. The one Ms. Blamey has provided is like an erotic poem on the theme of fat.\n           \n\n            It is a double-decker, both of its patties buried under American cheese and soaked with bone marrow that\u2019s been hit with a blowtorch. Liquid marrow falls from the burger; so do a few dark and crunchy fried shallots and orange blobs of cheese. On the side are very crisp and skinny fries tossed, after their second trip to the deep fryer, in melted dry-aged beef fat.\n           \n\n            I imagine the burger is pretty great after a few drinks. I ate it while I was as sober as a mechanical pencil, and it was all I could do not to paint my face with grease until I looked like Martin Sheen at the end of \u201cApocalypse Now.\u201d\n           \n\n            Any qualms I had about the price, $25, vanished while I was looking around the floor for my napkin. I had also rolled my eyes at first when I saw a $43 potpie on the menu of a former speakeasy. The thing is, it is an amazing potpie.\n           \n\n            The body of a Dungeness crab is stuffed, all the way out to its spiky corners, with a crab meat stew. Ms. Blamey based it on an abalone dish from Chile, where she grew up, and it gets its kick from fresh aj\u00ed dulce peppers along with ground Aleppo pepper. The richness that comes from the fatty innards of the crab helps the stew cling like cream to the tender puff pastry crust, which is dotted with sesame seeds.\n           \n\n            There are two desserts: a scoop of vanilla ice cream with pistachio streusel and parsnip pur\u00e9e (it\u2019s good, I swear), and a gold-foil-wrapped sandwich of ice cream made with Luxardo maraschino cherries pressed between square almond-cocoa cookies that are as black as Oreos.\n           \n\n            Along with cocktails, Chumley\u2019s drinks menu has a series of variations on the Scotch and soda, a terrific idea. Highballs deserve more attention from restaurants; they\u2019re more refreshing and more amenable to food than more concentrated medicine like the manhattan.\n           \n\n            Ms. Blamey works in a galley in the back. Across from her confined territory are the restrooms, where you can visit framed slices of the original wood tables. They were deeply carved over the years, and now the names and initials are displayed behind glass like frescoes from Pompeii.\n           \n\n            Nobody at Chumley\u2019s is likely to take a switchblade to the tables now, not after having to provide credit-card numbers to make a reservation. It\u2019s possible to get a table without one, but you wouldn\u2019t know that from the way the hosts greet new arrivals with one finger poised over an iPad and an expression that says, \u201cAre you on the list?\u201d\n           \n\n            There is something a little too clubby, too, about the way cards that read RESERVED are placed on the empty tables and in front of unoccupied bar stools, even when the restaurant is winding down for the night. Closing time is midnight now, a concession to neighbors who fought the liquor license.\n           \n\n            Chumley\u2019s is emphatically worth going to as long as Ms. Blamey remains content to work in that kitchen. What happens after that is anyone\u2019s guess. The reservations policy seems to keep people from just dropping by for a drink, and casual drinking was part of the atmosphere that de Beauvoir liked so much.\n           \n\n            Now, instead of atmosphere, Chumley\u2019s has d\u00e9cor; the book jackets and photographs are elements in a haunted house attraction featuring the ghosts of Hemingway and Kerouac. The neighbors sleep better, but the neighborhood isn\u2019t as interesting.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 211, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/dining/chumleys-review-bar-west-village.html", "google_mag": 28.399999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n            AUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 \u201cHow much brisket are you having?\u201d\n           \n\n            That\u2019s the first question the man with the knife behind the counter will ask when you reach the front of the line at\n            \n             Franklin Barbecue\n            \n            . He won\u2019t stab you if you don\u2019t have an answer ready, but I might.\n           \n\n            By that point, you or another person who is either being paid by you or who just likes you very much will have been waiting outside for two hours or more \u2014\n            \n             sometimes a lot more\n            \n            . The line starts earlier and grows faster on weekends and during South by Southwest, the festival of music, film and technology that metastasizes here each March and runs, this year, through Sunday.\n           \n\n            Nobody reaches the front of the line accidentally. If you haven\u2019t managed to work out how much brisket to buy when you get there, you are beyond my help.\n           \n\n            I won\u2019t blame you, though, if you double your order after the man with the knife cuts off a little block of meat and hands it to you. Look at it, the way it shades from nut-brown at the inside to cherry-jam around the border to black at the crust, stained by carbon and stubbled with coarse pepper. Smell it while the steam is still carrying the smell of burning post oak. Taste it, the way it combines the fat-bathed richness of fresh beef with the tight focus of meat cured by salt and smoke. Still want just half a pound?\n           \n\n            Other considerations come into play, like the elasticity of your stomach and your taste for pork, smoked sausage and turkey. But brisket is the foundation on which Franklin Barbecue was built, brisket as it is seasoned and barbecued by Aaron Franklin, the chief pitmaster and an owner.\n           \n\n            Mr. Franklin is a gearhead and a MacGyver with obsessive tendencies. Men like him were building hot rods in the 1960s and six-chambered bongs in the \u201970s. In the 2000s, Mr. Franklin was designing and welding offset smokers and firing them up for loosely organized backyard cookouts. He writes in his book,\n            \n             \u201cFranklin Barbecue: A Meat-Smoking Manifesto,\u201d\n            \n            that his first brisket was \u201cflavorless \u2014 tough and dry.\u201d\n           \n\n            He got better. By 2009, when he began selling meat from a white-and-aqua-blue 1971 Aristocrat Lo-Liner trailer he\u2019d bought for $300, he had moved far upscale from the cheap supermarket brisket of his first experiments. And when he moved to an actual structure, painted to look like an overgrown version of that trailer, his brisket was already famous.\n           \n\n            He had studied the physics of chimney draw and the maddeningly long time during which barbecue appears to have stopped cooking long before it\u2019s done, known in the trade as \u201cthe stall.\u201d He has to be the first pitmaster in Texas history whose cookbook has a list of recommended books that is devoted entirely to the food-science writers\n            \n             Harold McGee\n            \n            and\n            \n             Nathan Myhrvold\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            What Mr. Franklin had stumbled across in his backyard was a craft in which, for both the maker and the consumer, the financial barrier to entry was low and the opportunity for connoisseurship was ample. These are the two chief prerequisites of any successful hipster food business, and Franklin Barbecue set off a new-traditionalist barbecue movement across the country.\n           \n\n            One of Mr. Franklin\u2019s apostasies from old-school central Texas barbecue technique is wrapping meat midway through smoking to keep it from drying out. All his products are noticeably juicy; the turkey is helped by a quick dip in a pan of butter and juices. He swaddles brisket in butcher paper, which lets some steam out. Other meats are sealed inside aluminum foil. I wondered if this was the reason the marbling inside the brisket was more appetizing than the fat on the pork ribs and pulled pork, which could be a little wet and squishy.\n           \n\n            Much of the fat simply yields a glossy liquid that makes a delicious sauce for the lightly smoky pulled pork. The smoke works its way more thoroughly into the ribs, which become a firm and chewy pig candy, and into the sausages. Franklin Barbecue isn\u2019t famous for its sausages, which are custom-made by a nearby butcher. They are glorious, though, loaded with pepper and garlic and enough beef fat to make the wrinkled surface of the casings sparkle. Within the next few days, they will be ground and stuffed on site.\n           \n\n            As for the turkey, it is so mild that it will probably be of surpassing interest only to those who don\u2019t eat beef or pork who\u2019ve been dragged along by brisket-crazed friends. Vegetarians may find some comfort in the fine vinegared slaw of purple cabbage or the potato salad, made in the creamy style that I hope to find at every picnic. They will run from the pinto beans, which are supplemented by odds and ends of meat scraped from the butcher block.\n           \n\n            Near the cash register are palm-size pies wrapped in plastic, with old-fashioned crusts. Lemon chess pie had a citrus tartness that the Key lime pie was missing, and I admired the way the bourbon-banana pie compressed childhood and adulthood in a single dessert.\n           \n\n            And so, you ask: Is it worth the wait? The answer, like many things in life, depends on what else you could be doing with your time. I would note that in the hours required to line up and sit down at Franklin Barbecue, I could have driven 35 miles northeast to\n            \n             Louie Mueller Barbecue\n            \n            in Taylor, ordered the magnificent beef rib (which Franklin sells only on Saturdays), and eaten it until I couldn\u2019t hold any more.\n           \n\n            But I\u2019d also note that I would not trade Franklin\u2019s brisket for Mueller\u2019s. I doubt I\u2019d trade Franklin\u2019s brisket for anybody\u2019s, although for other meats, and certainly for turkey, I may give a slight edge to\n            \n             Killen\u2019s Barbecue\n            \n            in Pearland.\n           \n\n            Finally, I\u2019d point out that the line at Mr. Franklin\u2019s restaurant is not Mr. Franklin\u2019s fault, except insofar as he is responsible for cooking meat that people sacrifice entire mornings for. The line is a function of popularity and the way Texas barbecue is sliced (on the spot) and sold (by weight).\n           \n\n            Franklin Barbecue also goes out of its way to offer customers standing outside what you might call palliative care. A dozen or so folding chairs are kept in a corral under the stairs for early birds. Although the main entrance is locked until 10:59 a.m., another door is opened so the faithful can use the restrooms or buy drinks.\n           \n\n            An employee will walk down the line several times in the morning, selling canned beer from a cooler (Franklin stocks beers from some of the city\u2019s best breweries) and trying to estimate when the meats will run out. This is an imprecise science, involving people\u2019s best guesses for what they\u2019ll order when they get inside.\n           \n\n            On my first visit, I was right in the middle of the parking lot, and was told there was a chance I\u2019d miss out on pulled pork. That was incorrect, I\u2019m happy to say.\n           \n\n            Though inexact, Franklin\u2019s estimates can fend off the kind of disappointment I felt at\n            \n             La Barbecue\n            \n            , a highly regarded local truck where I spent more than an hour one afternoon and where everything but chopped beef was gone by the time I\u2019d inchwormed to the front of the line.\n           \n\n            Franklin Barbecue doesn\u2019t have to be so humane. Employees could probably stand on the roof pouring hot lard over customers\u2019 heads without driving too many people away. Once you start thinking about how much brisket you want, it\u2019s hard to leave.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 212, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/dining/franklin-barbecue-review.html", "google_mag": 29.5}, {"review_text": "\n            I\u2019m on the verge of giving up trying to explain why Ignacio Mattos\u2019s food is so good.\n           \n\n            I once wrote that the cooking at his first restaurant, now closed, dabbled in \u201cdeep, surrealist weirdness.\u201d At\n            \n             Estela\n            \n            , the place on Houston Street that put him on the map, I described his food as \u201calmost familiar, but not quite.\u201d What struck me at his most recent restaurant,\n            \n             Caf\u00e9 Altro Paradiso\n            \n            , was \u201cthe inverse relationship between prettiness and deliciousness.\u201d (What I ate was unpretty and highly delicious.)\n           \n\n            In retrospect, nothing I wrote captured the qualities that made the food compelling. I latched on to visual style because I couldn\u2019t figure out how to explain why the flavors grabbed me the way they did. After spending some time at\n            \n             Flora Bar\n            \n            , which Mr. Mattos opened in October, I\u2019ve started to think that whatever it is that sets his food apart is something you can\u2019t see. It\u2019s a kind of cooking that\u2019s almost invisible.\n           \n\n            Flora Bar is inside\n            \n             the Met Breuer museum\n            \n            , Marcel Breuer\u2019s blunt and muscular stack of granite and concrete on Madison Avenue in the 70s, regarded as a masterpiece of the brutalist style. \u201cThe taste for its disconcertingly top-heavy, inverted pyramidal mass grows on one slowly,\u201d the architecture critic for The New York Times,\n            \n             Ada Louise Huxtable, wrote\n            \n            in 1966, \u201clike a taste for olives or warm beer.\u201d\n           \n\n            The food at Flora Bar is much easier to like than warm beer. Under the direction of Jake Nemmers, the executive chef, it comes out of the kitchen in a series of tidily formal circles and squares. The rough edges of the cooking at Altro Paradiso and Estela have been refined, which makes it even more astonishing when the flavors come at you out of nowhere.\n           \n\n            A simple red disc on a white plate, Flora Bar\u2019s tuna tartare isn\u2019t like any I\u2019ve had before; it pops with toasted flax seeds and crunches with fried shallots, neither of which hides the clean, cold taste of chopped yellowfin tuna. Flora Bar does not quite reinvent tuna tartare the way Estela reinvents beef tartare, but it comes closer than you\u2019d think was possible.\n           \n\n            Steak comes with b\u00e9arnaise and beet hunks. The beets look a little wrinkled, like prunes, and have an uncannily focused flavor. The b\u00e9arnaise is silky and light on the herbs. The steak looks like steak, sliced. It is tender, and the flavor goes on and on as you chew, yet it doesn\u2019t have the meat-locker stink of dry-aged beef. Something must have happened to make it so extraordinary, but the answer is not visible. (The beef has been given, among other treatments, a surreptitious marination in fish sauce.)\n           \n\n            How can a shrimp cocktail hold any surprises? Well, there\u2019s the price, $29, which may be a record. But then there\u2019s the astonishingly fine flavor and texture of the blue shrimp themselves, glossy and appealingly slippery on a bed of ice pebbles. They\u2019re terrific, and so is their dark, uncloying cocktail sauce.\n           \n\n            Note the name. Flora Bar is, when you get down to it, less a restaurant than a wine bar. The plates are almost all small; even the steak, which could pass as a main course, is a far cry from a steakhouse portion. Flora Bar is not trying to be a utilitarian cafe for museum patrons who knocked themselves out taking in\n            \n             Kerry James Marshall\u2019s show\n            \n            upstairs and now want a cheap, filling meal. That job goes to Flora Coffee next door, where you can get sandwiches and pastries during the day.\n           \n\n            The wine list at Flora Bar is about as exhaustive as any artist\u2019s career retrospective. It contains multitudes, and in three visits, I barely scratched the surface. And I left the shelves and shelves of tempting, knowledgeably chosen spirits mostly untouched, apart from the slug of gin that went into my very soothing Tuxedo No. 2 cocktail.\n           \n\n            As wine bars go, it\u2019s somewhat stiff. The service can be punctilious in a way that I imagine is meant to appeal to the Upper East Sider, but fans of Estela (and there are many Upper East Siders in that group) may find it slightly off-putting.\n           \n\n            Or\n            \n             Mr. Mattos and his business partner, Thomas Carter,\n            \n            may just be trying to live up to the space. It\u2019s an exceptionally dramatic one, with marble surfaces and banquettes of dark leather and windows the size of billboards that look out on Breuer\u2019s bridge across the moat below Madison Avenue. A sculpture garden when this building still housed\n            \n             the Whitney Museum of American Art\n            \n            , the moat is now an outdoor extension for Flora Bar. I miss the art, but the tables look inviting enough to make me come back when the weather warms up.\n           \n\n            The menu is part tapas, part sashimi and part something else. On the tapas side, we have wonderfully crunchy croquetas with a soft core of warm raclette, pink shavings of jam\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rico, and a plate of anchovies, three cured in oil and three in brine. The quality is impeccable if you can get over paying $18 for six anchovies. I couldn\u2019t.\n           \n\n            Representing sashimi, there is shimmering raw seafood, some of it on or under squares of nori. You\u2019re meant to treat the nori like a tortilla. A month ago, the filling in this taco was raw scallops and a salty streak of plum paste, and I was quietly happy. When I went back, the nori covered sticky raw red shrimp and sea urchin, and I went completely giddy.\n           \n\n            It took me a minute to warm up to another raw dish, the lobster crudo. Raw lobster is not something you naturally want to cuddle up with. Here it is chopped with shiso and molded into a disc, ready to be swabbed in a soft-spoken mayonnaise. It\u2019s refined and almost comforting.\n           \n\n            As for something else, you tell me how to characterize raclette and golden slices of rutabaga over a thin, buttery tart shell, or an omelet that is in fact cooked in a thin disc, inverted on to the plate runny-side down, and then topped with spoonfuls of hackleback caviar, firm trout roe and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.\n           \n\n            There\u2019s a fine line between simple and dull, and one or two dishes fell on the wrong side. Stracciatella with lemon peel and cubes of fennel struck me as an ordinary burrata salad traveling under an alias. Halibut with wild mushrooms was no more than the sum of its parts, although they were very good parts.\n           \n\n            Natasha Pickowicz\u2019s desserts sound safe but can be daring. Mandarin sorbet in a kind of cradle made of coconut was served with a yuzu sauce so sour it made me sit up straight. After the initial shock, I loved it.\n           \n\n            If I\u2019d expected the parfait of chocolate and amarena cherries to be a layered dessert served in a tall glass, like other parfaits, I was wrong. This was cherry-flavored chocolate, as dense as ganache, and served in the shape of, you guessed it, a disc.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 213, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/dining/flora-bar-review.html", "google_mag": 32.29999923706055}, {"review_text": "\n\n             Pig Bleecker\n            \n            takes the second half of its name from its Greenwich Village address and the first from\n            \n             Pig Beach\n            \n            , a beer garden and barbecue stand on the idyllic shores of the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn. The two places share a chef, several owners, some sauces and recipes, and a fondness for wood smoke. They have pigs in their names for a reason, but one appealing thing about Pig Bleecker is how often it gravitates toward cooking that has nothing to do with barbecued pork.\n           \n\n            One recent night, a length of striped bass was half-buried under charred green buds of romanesco broccoli, chopped smoked almonds \u2014 not the kind from a can \u2014 and spoonfuls of chopped fresh herbs in olive oil. The flavors were clean and strong, the approach direct and Italian. \u201cI could see this at a Batali restaurant,\u201d I wrote in my notes.

I generally try not to think about what they did to it there, but I couldn\u2019t help recalling it at Pig Bleecker, which gets closer to the taste of the original with fish cheeks than Guy\u2019s did with actual squid.\n           \n\n            In fact, a lot of Mr. Abdoo\u2019s menu successfully does what Guy\u2019s claims and fails to do. It rounds up unfancy American dishes whose natural habitat is small taverns and bars and shacks on the state road just outside town.\n            \n             Utica greens\n            \n            , spicy chopped escarole baked under bread crumbs and Parmigiano-Reggiano, are terrific at Pig Bleecker.\n           \n\n            Mr. Abdoo\u2019s affection for regional specialties is written all over the slate of sandwiches Pig Bleecker serves at lunch. Baltimore pit beef is represented, thinly shaved with charred edges and a horseradish sauce inside an onion roll. So is the New Orleans muffuletta. Cold cuts and smoked mozzarella are piled on a sesame hero roll instead of the customary miniature hubcap, and it\u2019s arguably too sparing with the olive relish. So call it an Italian hero with olives; it\u2019s still a great thing to eat for lunch.\n           \n\n            Is Pig Bleecker crazy for serving a pastrami sandwich within walking distance of\n            \n             Katz\u2019s Delicatessen\n            \n            ? Is the meat a little too lean? Does melting Gruy\u00e8re on it make Mr. Abdoo a heretic? Yes to all of the above. On the other hand, his pastrami has an unusually fine flavor, shot through with a robust vein of smoke.\n           \n\n            Smoke runs through much of the cooking like a rhythm track. A thick-cut chop spends time in the smoker before it goes on the grill; served with battered onions and a peach glaze that\u2019s spicy, tart and sweet, it\u2019s one of the strongest main courses on the dinner menu.\n           \n\n            Pig Bleecker\u2019s take on Buffalo wings involves not just smoking them but trimming the drumsticks into lollipops, leaving an exposed length of bone for a handle. They\u2019re dressed in butter swirled with a reasonably spicy sauce of red Hatch peppers. You can find that sauce, or something like it, at Pig Beach, along with the Alabama white sauce that turns up as a dip for the celery sticks that come with Pig Bleecker\u2019s wings. I must be a heretic, too, because I like the white sauce more than blue cheese dressing.\n           \n\n            The sauces Mr. Abdoo invented for Pig Beach are worth importing to Manhattan, especially a sweetened mustard number that does wonders for the pigs in blankets. The two restaurants strike different tones, though. At Pig Beach, dogs and children wander between the picnic tables, and orders are placed at a canopied bar and an outdoor barbecue counter that backs up against the Gowanus. (\u201cNo fishing,\u201d the signs warn anyone who may have\n            \n             mistaken the canal for a body of water\n            \n            .)\n           \n\n            Pig Bleecker is more domesticated. There is one long communal table made from a single polished slab of wood in the center of the room. Around the wall is a banquette of leather the approximate color of the mustard sauce. Instead of paper towels and wet wipes in an American flag pouch, the tables are set with cloth napkins. The design is crisp and urbane, to the extent that those words can apply to a place with the head of a Texas longhorn mounted on the wall.\n           \n\n            I might give Pig Bleecker more than an enthusiastic single star if the cooking didn\u2019t sometimes swing and miss. \u201cDeviled steak and eggs\u201d sounds more clever than the thing it describes, deviled eggs with beef tartare piled under the yolks. (At lunch, the eggs are more effectively paired with thin sheets of country ham.) The crudit\u00e9 platter is a gorgeous spread of raw and gently cooked vegetables, and a good buy at $13, but it deserves better than the generic cocktail-party dips.\n           \n\n            Oddly, given Mr. Abdoo\u2019s time at Del Posto, pasta can be dull. Ravioli filled with juicy bundles of smoked and braised brisket could have used a real sauce instead of melted truffle butter with zigzags of reduced Barolo. Tossing house-made cavatelli with clams and \u2019nduja is a great idea, but I wanted more flavor from the clams and more spice from the \u2019nduja.\n           \n\n            There is also an Oreo cheesecake that proves not everything gets better when you stuff it into a Mason jar. More than making up for that, though, is the deliciously tart key lime pie with a crunchy nut crust. Then there is a peanut butter milkshake with hot fudge and a buckeye candy on top (creamy and smooth, like peanut ganache), and a hot fudge and brownie sundae. They\u2019re both true to their ice cream parlor roots, and truly good.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 214, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/dining/pig-bleecker-review-greenwich-village.html", "google_mag": 26.899999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n            To begin at the end, the desserts at the new\n            \n             Empell\u00f3n\n            \n            in Midtown are some of the most exciting New York has seen in a long time.\n           \n\n            Empell\u00f3n is the flashiest, fanciest and newest of Alex Stupak\u2019s three restaurants, and the one that provides the fullest expression of his dreamscape vision of Mexican food. He doesn\u2019t reproduce or translate the cuisine; he builds a fantasy version of it, coupling deep technical skills with imagination to create a slightly unreal version of reality, the way the best animated movies do.\n           \n\n            Dessert lends itself to fantasies better than other kinds of cooking, a fact that Mr. Stupak and his pastry chef, Justin Binnie, have exploited to the hilt.\n           \n\n            One of the desserts is a frozen parfait that looks like half an avocado on a snowy bed of ice. The illusion is almost perfect, with tones of green that fade from the near black of the peel to a grassy pale color in the divot where the pit should go. The mimicry isn\u2019t just visual. The parfait is as creamy and smooth as the flesh of an avocado left on the counter for four days. But of course it\u2019s sweeter and tastes of butterfat, so it\u2019s a relief when the ice crystals melt on your tongue into a bright limeade. Under the ice is yogurt infused with eucalyptus. Although making all this can\u2019t possibly be simple, the flavors are, and they\u2019re wonderfully balanced.\n           \n\n            Another dessert comes in the form of a taco, because why not? A waffle cone folded into the shape of a hard-shell tortilla is stuffed with a delicious ice cream flavored by corn and salt. It might be Empell\u00f3n\u2019s answer to the corn husk meringue at\n            \n             Cosme\n            \n            . It might be a tribute to Corn Pops. Either way, it\u2019s great.\n           \n\n            \u201cStrawberries for the table\u201d is a plate of seven one-bite sweets with different permutations of the fruit. One is a raw, red berry. Its leaves have been replaced by shiso, it\u2019s been stuffed with yuzu jelly, and it\u2019s electrifying. Another is a birch-flavored marshmallow dusted with powdered, dried strawberries. Eating all seven took me about four minutes (including pauses for such penetrating insights as \u201cWow!\u201d) and completely restored my faith in the power of a good pastry chef to amplify and extend the themes that started with vegetables and meat.\n           \n\n            Restaurant reviews don\u2019t usually turn over so much space to desserts, but the ones at Empell\u00f3n deserve it. They also illustrate how much Mr. Stupak has matured as both chef and restaurateur since\n            \n             he left a career in pastry\n            \n            to tackle Mexican food.\n           \n\n\n\n            Before it closed recently,\n            \n             Empell\u00f3n Cocina\n            \n            in the East Village was Mr. Stupak\u2019s statement restaurant, and boy, did he have a statement to make. He had come out of the pastry kitchens of two of the country\u2019s most determinedly avant-garde restaurants,\n            \n             Alinea\n            \n            and\n            \n             WD-50\n            \n            , and many of his dishes were self-consciously arty and tightly clenched. Even the action-painting bloops of salsa and mole radiated tension. I loved the flavors, but sometimes it seemed as if Mr. Stupak didn\u2019t have the heart to tell his food that somebody was going to try to eat it.\n           \n\n            Maybe it\u2019s the competition from Cosme, which takes a much less formalist approach to high-end Mexican cooking. Maybe Mr. Stupak has more empathy for his customers now. Maybe setting up shop in a big, two-level space in Midtown in March triggered a dormant crowd-pleasing gene. Whatever the cause, the food he is cooking at Empell\u00f3n wants to be liked.\n           \n\n            There\u2019s no doubt that you\u2019re supposed to knock back the oyster shooter in tomato-and-orange-flavored water with drops of ketchup oil floating on the surface. A distillation of the flavors in a Mexican seafood cocktail, the shooter disappears in one fast gulp.\n           \n\n            Another seafood cocktail is made from poached lobster and curls and spears of cucumber jutting out of a lovely lobster cream that functions like a party dip. Served in a vase like a flower arrangement \u2014 there are even some purple star-shaped blossoms scattered around \u2014 it\u2019s as striking as anything at Empell\u00f3n Cocina, but the relaxed generosity feels new.\n           \n\n            There\u2019s a wild salad of yellow beets under a snow pile of green-chile granita and coconut crema. And there\u2019s a tart heap of salmon tartare chopped with gooseberries; it\u2019s dotted with crema and a gooseberry-pasilla chile salsa.\n           \n\n            One dish puts young red-leaf lettuces spritzed with lime and salted water next to what looks like the icing on a birthday cake: It\u2019s salsa verde creamed with butter, spread smooth and ringed with crema in tiny piped rosettes. If there is anyone who hasn\u2019t yet figured out that butter makes salads better, spreading this salsa verde icing on lettuce leaves should be persuasive.\n           \n\n            Larger courses don\u2019t have built-in structural barriers to sharing, as some dishes at Empell\u00f3n Cocina did. Roasted sea bream is served whole under pickled onions, thin wheels of tomatillo and miniature salsa-verde-soaked chilaquiles. Short-rib confit pulls apart into rich purplish hunks that you eat with a version of picadillo in which every ingredient tastes more delicious than it\u2019s supposed to.\n           \n\n            Pork belly slices attached to ribbons of crunchy skin come inside a kind of taco bowl made from a single, plate-size chicharr\u00f3n. You can crack the chicharr\u00f3n and use the shards as chips, or you can fold it into a warm tortilla with watermelon radishes, sliced chiles and some habanero salsa that gives the pork the get-up-and-go it needs.\n           \n\n\n\n            In one section of the menu, Empell\u00f3n\u2019s desire to please does not quite translate into actual pleasure: the tacos. I used to think Mr. Stupak did not know what tacos are. He\u2019s been serving them for so long, though, that now I suspect he just wants them to be something else.\n           \n\n            He seems to have the idea that because people love tacos, he can fill them with weird things \u2014 curled tendrils of octopus on spicy peanut butter, or dense and dry falafel balls with grasshopper hummus \u2014 as an invitation to the rest of the menu.\n           \n\n            Yes, anything can be turned into a taco, but perhaps not everything should. The best taco I had at Empell\u00f3n, not counting the corn ice cream, was one I made from the peppers and onions sizzling on an iron plate on which a server had briefly seared a Wagyu steak. This is a great, witty take on fajitas, although the joke would be funnier if it didn\u2019t cost $125.\n           \n\n            You can write off the tacos completely, and what\u2019s left is still a very enjoyable restaurant. The architecture firm\n            \n             Glen & Company\n            \n            has brought some Broadway boogie-woogie to the space, creating rhythm with colors and suspending a theatrical scalloped balcony over the main floor. There\u2019s enough room between the tables for a bar cart to trundle around loaded with bottles of mezcal and other hard stuff. It\u2019s another way for Mr. Stupak to show that he\u2019s serious now about bringing the party to the table.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 215, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/dining/empellon-review-mexican-midtown.html", "google_mag": 31.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n            New York kept certain fantasies about\n            \n             the Four Seasons\n            \n            alive for a long time. We told ourselves that it was an elegant restaurant, that it was an important restaurant, that the roll call of designers, editors and so on who ate lunch there \u2014 a short list that grew shorter as publishers moved downtown, expense accounts were clipped and longtime patrons were called by the great reservationist in the sky \u2014 was proof of something other than the tendency of famous and busy people to act from habit and herd instinct.\n           \n\n            Long before the end, fantasy and reality had gone separate ways. The Four Seasons was a mess. The beaded curtain chains that rippled upward for 20 feet in endless waves like a waterfall running in reverse were coming apart, some of them missing or broken or lying on the floor like dead snakes. The bronze-rod Richard Lippold sculpture that hangs in midair over the towers of whiskey and gin bottles inside the square bar was furry with dust.\n           \n\n            A dinner I had in 2013 was a disaster, from the stale rolls to the zombified service to the dry and crumbly duck served with fruit compote that tasted like the filling in a grocery-store pie. It goes without saying that all this cost a pile of money.\n           \n\n            Because the restaurant\u2019s lease was winding down, I never wrote up that meal. And when the landlord signed a new one with the\n            \n             Major Food Group\n            \n            instead of the old owners, New Yorkers might have mourned the end of our fantasy Four Seasons, but there weren\u2019t a lot of reasons to be sad about losing the real one.\n           \n\n            Now, instead of one restaurant, we have two. Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone, the two chefs who run the Major Food Group with their noncooking partner, Jeff Zalaznick, have taken a divide-and-conquer strategy. Mr. Torrisi is in charge of what was the Pool Room and is now just the Pool.\n            \n             The Grill\n            \n            , formerly the Grill Room, is in the hands of Mr. Carbone. It was the first to open, in May, and comes very close to being the kind of restaurant many of us imagined in this space all along.\n           \n\n            The Grill is confident, theatrical, retro, unsentimental, sharp and New Yorky. Like other projects from Major Food Group, it is packed with ideas and historical allusions. Unpacking it all is a lot of fun if you can afford it; preposterous expense is one reality of the old restaurant that the new tenants preserved.\n           \n\n            They also preserved the\n            \n             Philip Johnson\n            \n            interior, after the landlord proposed some changes that were\n            \n             swatted down by the Landmarks Preservation Commission\n            \n            . Rightly so: funded by the Seagram Company, Johnson did something astonishing in this room. It\u2019s a vast space that offers privacy, a corporate monument that gives back to the public, an expression of International Style austerity that feels exuberant.\n           \n\n            All that is in sharp focus again now that it\u2019s holding a restaurant with a full battery charge. The beads have been strung back together. Lippold\u2019s bronze glints again. The book-matched French walnut paneling is glossier and more radiant, the patterns in the grain more evocative of monumental abstract paintings, than before.\n           \n\n\n\n            Mr. Carbone, Mr. Torrisi and Mr. Zalaznick prepare for their restaurants the way Matthew Weiner or David Simon get ready for a new show, with a mountain of research. Taking over a high point of midcentury modernism gave them license to study James Beard, rolling trolleys, Jacqueline Kennedy, the martini, John Cage, club sandwiches, Joe Baum, continental cuisine, Delmonico\u2019s, green goddess dressing, Craig Claiborne and Catalina sauce.\n           \n\n            Some dish names are cryptic, as if written to invite a question the servers can answer with a story. The one about \u201cJack\u2019s Pie\u201d involves John F. Kennedy and comes in two parts. The second is a dubious dirty joke about Marilyn Monroe.\n           \n\n            This postmodern approach to modernism leads to some self-conscious nonsense. Next to the staircase is a buffet table set with a surreal cornucopia of vegetables, fruits and layer cakes. It\u2019s stunning to look at but it\u2019s purely decorative \u2014 \u201ca buffet in name only,\u201d the servers have to explain.\n           \n\n            Dinner sees a traffic jam of rolling carts parked tableside for various bits of stage business, some of which are pointless. Peach Melba doesn\u2019t get better when you set it on fire, and when a server painstakingly removes a pastry seal on a cocotte to reveal two pieces of endive, you have to wonder if Mr. Carbone hasn\u2019t lost his mind.\n           \n\n            But any doubts about his sanity vanish when you taste the spectacularly good guinea hen that the endive accompanies. Roasted and sauced with jus, Madeira and black truffles, it is among the most delicious things I\u2019ve eaten this year.\n           \n\n            So is the Seagram crab cake, very sweet and pure under a golden lid of potato coins.\n           \n\n            So is the prime rib, carved thick or thin at your elbow \u2014 this time, the ritual makes sense \u2014 and set in front of you along with a meaty barbecued bone in a dark mustard and spice crust.\n           \n\n            So are the lamb chops, brushed with curry oil and grilled, with yogurt sauce and a fantastic molded cone of apple-mint jelly.\n           \n\n            So is the honey-mustard duck breast, dry aged for a month until it is supernaturally tender.\n           \n\n            So is the larded squab in bittersweet orange sauce with a grilled candied orange; the lard is provided by a cloak of whipped fat that bathes the squab breast as it cooks.\n           \n\n            So is the slice of lemon chiffon cake confected by Jennifer Yee, who is serving as pastry chef until the restaurant is on solid footing. Perfectly tender and fluffy and just sweet enough, it is the kind of dessert that has almost disappeared from New York restaurants, and deserves to come back.\n           \n\n            I\u2019ll be thinking about those dishes for the rest of the year, and probably beyond. At least half a dozen others are merely very, very good: the gently spicy salad called avocado crab Louis; the anchovy-laced steak tartare that finishes with a surprising riptide of chile heat; the broodingly dark crab gumbo; the \u201cNeptune\u2019s crown\u201d Dover sole under a Creole shellfish sauce; the hot pretzel twists and the griddled anadama bread and the nearly weightless dinner rolls brushed with butter that come around at the start of the meal.\n           \n\n            For all of this you pay prices that range from \u201cWow\u201d to \u201cAre you guys serious?\u201d The reassembled lobster Newburg (or Newberg, as the menu has it), in a reduced-fat sauce outfitted with dried cherry tomatoes and basil leaves, is marked \u201cMP\u201d on the menu; it\u2019s $98, about five times what you\u2019d pay for a live lobster of the same size.\n           \n\n            At least it\u2019s memorable, which is more than can be said for the $25 jumble of smoked wild mushrooms held together by a wafer-thin one-egg \u201comelet,\u201d or the $38 chicken \u201c\u00e0 la Queen,\u201d which is like chicken cacciatore that\u2019s been fancied up.\n           \n\n\n\n            Balanced against a few lapses of taste and judgment, though, is the real achievement of Mr. Carbone and his partners in breathing new life into the formal, French-derived style of dining. This used to be the only style chefs thought was suitable for expensive restaurants. But then tasting counters came along; suddenly the rituals of captains standing at attention above white tablecloths seemed antiquated.\n           \n\n            Taking off from the model the Major Food Group polished at\n            \n             Carbone\n            \n            , the Grill turns that old and increasingly empty formality into theater, or a game that everybody can get in on. The captains are allowed to have personalities, which means the rest of us can, too. It would work even better if Major Food Group hired more women for the dining room; it\u2019s hard to imagine many female captains who would be O.K. with calling Marilyn Monroe \u201cJack\u2019s pie.\u201d\n           \n\n            As a strict constructionist about the architecture of this space, I can\u2019t write about it without registering the loss of the lovely, understated\n            \n             modernist stemware, bowls and other pieces\n            \n            designed specifically for these rooms by\n            \n             Garth\n            \n            and\n            \n             Ada Louise Huxtable\n            \n            . Eating here without them is like visiting a Frank Lloyd Wright house furnished by Ikea.\n           \n\n            Some of the things they\u2019ve been replaced by are very good. Others are reasonably apt. A few are painful. The chunky brass bar coasters marked with a big capital G are a Trumpian touch. So are the napkins with \u201cTHE GRILL\u201d embroidered in gold thread.\n           \n\n            But coasters and napkins can\u2019t cause lasting damage to an interior this extraordinary. It was always one of the most beautiful dining rooms in New York. Now it\u2019s also one of its most exciting restaurants.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 216, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/dining/the-grill-review-midtown.html", "google_mag": 33.900001525878906}, {"review_text": "\n            PROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2014 Raw bluefish was on the menu at\n            \n             Oberlin\n            \n            in July, and I was thinking: I hope they know what they\u2019re doing. Bluefish goes off so quickly that there was a chance my first impression would end my curiosity about this restaurant.\n           \n\n            But I gave it a shot, and it was great: sliced cold and neatly fanned out like sashimi, then sprinkled with olive oil and salt and pickled garlic-chive buds, the bluefish was chewy and soft at the same time, somehow, and had a rich, oily flavor that was especially delicious because I knew that in 24 hours it would taste half as good and a day after that it wouldn\u2019t be worth eating at all.\n           \n\n            Finding bluefish fresh enough to serve raw takes connections down at the waterfront. Oberlin\u2019s chef, Benjamin Sukle, has been cultivating relationships with fishing captains in southern Rhode Island for about four years since he opened\n            \n             Birch\n            \n            , his small tasting-counter restaurant in this city\u2019s compact downtown.\n           \n\n            His shopping list got longer when he opened Oberlin a few blocks away early last year. Fish isn\u2019t the only thing on the menu here, but there is a lot of it, and the ways Mr. Sukle uses it illustrate the exploration of local ingredients that makes Oberlin the most rewarding new restaurant I know of in Southern New England.\n           \n\n            The menu starts with a long list of raw seafood that is a snapshot of what\u2019s swimming around Rhode Island at the moment. \u201cWhen I go to the docks I\u2019m not just picking the best of the catch,\u201d Mr. Sukle said. \u201cIt\u2019s all great.\u201d\n           \n\n            I last ate there in the middle of September, when the raw fish included bonito and bigeye tuna, striped bass, mahi-mahi, both Spanish and Boston mackerel, and scup. A week or so later, the final gasps of a hurricane had chased the fish away, and Oberlin\u2019s raw bar was down to a dish dreamed up in the last hurricane season, mussels marinated in their steaming juices and a slug of aioli. Slightly rich and spicy under crunchy little sweet-potato chips, it is a terrific thing to eat even with plenty of fish around.\n           \n\n            Buying whole fish instead of fillets helps Mr. Sukle, who owns the restaurant with his wife, Heidi, keep prices down and the menu varied. I loved Oberlin\u2019s shiny, alluringly pasty brandade, made not with cod but with salted remnants of more abundant white-fleshed fish such as scup, mahi-mahi and fluke. It is served with a green splash of herbed olive oil on top and lightly toasted slices of the restaurant\u2019s excellent sourdough on the side.\n           \n\n            Salty pink hunks of cured bigeye tasted like the canned tuna of my dreams, alongside cucumbers and explosively ripe heirloom tomatoes seasoned with basil, wild mint and seaweed.\n           \n\n            Cured local bluefish stands in for imported anchovies in a bracingly original interpretation of puttanesca sauce in which the flavor of each ingredient \u2014 garlic and tomato and chiles and bluefish and razor-thin shavings of green olives \u2014 was clear and distinct.\n           \n\n            Birch is the smaller, tidier and quieter of Mr. Sukle\u2019s restaurants. Lamb pelts thrown over the backs of high leather-upholstered seats project a studied cool borrowed from Scandinavia. The handmade ceramics are plated with more delicate precision. Greater subtlety is drawn out of, or spirited into, the ingredients.\n           \n\n            There were delicious surprises in everything I tasted, and the set price of $55 for four painstaking courses was remarkably fair. When I ate there, charred cucumbers dressed with pistachio butter lurked below a translucent shingling of marinated cucumber. Airy fronds of fennel and a single preserved beach-rose petal had been airlifted into place on top.\n           \n\n            Wild foods like beach roses turn up in both restaurants, a sign of the imprint left by Mr. Sukle\u2019s brief stint at\n            \n             Noma\n            \n            , in Copenhagen. Some chefs have copied Noma in exactly the wrong way, importing ingredients that grow in Denmark instead of scouring their own landscapes. I wonder if Noma\u2019s chef,\n            \n             Ren\u00e9 Redzepi\n            \n            , ever feels like the character in \u201cMonty Python\u2019s Life of Brian\u201d who tells a crowd of followers, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to think for yourselves! You\u2019re all individuals!\u201d only to hear them shout back in unison, \u201cYes! We\u2019re all individuals!\u201d\n           \n\n            Mr. Sukle took Mr. Redzepi\u2019s teachings the right way. Edible discoveries get slightly more play at Birch, but the next time I\u2019m set loose in Providence for a night, odds are my feet will carry me to Oberlin. I like the friendly spontaneity of the dining-room crew. They\u2019re busier and can be harder to flag down than the staff at Birch, but once you have their attention they seem more engaged.\n           \n\n            Seating is in a rhythmic hodgepodge: high tables and bar stools to the right, regular tables to the left and out on the sidewalk, and a few wooden stools at the short counter facing the cooks who put together salads and slice raw fish under a sign that reads, \u201cTime flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana.\u201d (An absurdist streak is one of Providence\u2019s underappreciated charms.)\n           \n\n            I might settle in with sake \u2014 a diverse set of 10 are poured by the glass \u2014 or beer from such nonconformist breweries as\n            \n             To Ol\n            \n            in Copenhagen and\n            \n             Prairie Artisan Ales\n            \n            in Tulsa, Okla. If I was feeling lucky I might roll the dice on the wine list, which contains some reliably crafted natural wines alongside some lean, withholding ones. An Oregon pinot noir recommended as a staff favorite was, to me, off-puttingly thin and tart.\n           \n\n            Then I would get down to business, starting with raw fish, of course. A submerged Italian theme surfaces on the menu from time to time. My experience with Oberlin\u2019s handmade pastas, though, was patchy. The filled pastas I ordered were not very good; both the duck inside triangular pansotti and the pork folded into doughy ravioli were dry and a little severe. But then there was that inspired puttanesca tossed with fusilli, and some wonderful potato gnocchi that were browned on one side and stirred into a buttery clam broth with tender littlenecks.\n           \n\n            Knowing that Mr. Sukle seeks out produce I\u2019m not likely to meet every day, I\u2019d keep an eye out for things like Victor squash. This is also known as\n            \n             Red Warty Thing\n            \n            , an accurate description in the fall when it ripens, but Mr. Sukle is fond of it when it is still green and immature. Cut into thin raw crescents that were sandwiched with juicy slices of cantaloupe and sprinkled with fresh oregano and za\u2019atar, then arranged over creamed feta, it tasted like a cucumber that has been carbo-loading. Its thin, edible skin was also delightfully free of large warts. (The Red Warty Thing lobby should feel free to use that language in its ad copy.)\n           \n\n            Most nights see two whole, bone-in fish on the menu, one grilled and the other roasted. I\u2019ve had yellowtail flounder and Boston mackerel, and both were cooked just the way they should be, with a hint of pink along the spine.\n           \n\n            The same two desserts were offered each time I went. One was a rustic blueberry tart that was slightly underbaked on a first encounter and perfect the second time around. The other was a peach-blossom custard topped with fresh fruit. The custard had the fluffiness of a soft meringue. It was, in fact, a panna cotta infused with flowers that were preserved just like the rose petals and then frothed with a nitrous oxide canister. It was studiously put together but easy to like, which come to think of it is not a bad description of Oberlin itself.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 217, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/dining/oberlin-restaurant-review-providence.html", "google_mag": 32.900001525878906}, {"review_text": "\n         Not until I\u2019d tried sweet potatoes with butterscotch peas and curls of tender sepia; twirled dan-dan noodles in a hot-and-sour vinaigrette; turned velvety spinach and bluefoot shrimp around and around in Mozambican peanut sauce; slashed the yolk of a poached egg so it would spill out over crunchy rice and sour kimchi; and felt my mouth water at the first bite of tart passionfruit curd \u2014 not until then did it occur to me that I had been eating a tasting menu.\n        \n\n         Nothing about this meal at Louro, a two-month-old restaurant in Greenwich Village, seemed self-indulgent or self-impressed. None of the courses seemed intended to make a point or brandish a technique. The chef, David Santos, wasn\u2019t trying to show off to his customers. He wanted to host a party for them.\n        \n\n         This party was B.Y.O.B., as it often is on Monday nights at Louro, when the restaurant puts away its \u00e0 la carte menu and serves a fixed-price meal. While some restaurants that offer tastings also push a wine pairing that can double the check, Louro let me carry in beer I\u2019d picked up at the supermarket. I appreciated the savings because, at $75 for five courses, this meal was not quite cheap.\n        \n\n         The theme of the menu was Some Like It Hot, and it offered a five-course tour of some of the world\u2019s most chile-besotted cuisines, from Jamaican to Sichuan. Mr. Santos even did something almost radical these days, when many chefs are so intent on controlling the night that they won\u2019t leave salt on the table. At the start of the meal, our server set down a little dish of roasted piri-piri chiles in rust-colored oil. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty spicy,\u201d he said. \u201cJust put a little on anything you want.\u201d I wanted it on almost everything.\n        \n\n         Mr. Santos began serving theme dinners like this in November 2011, about a year before he opened Louro. The series began as a private supper club in his apartment, and the freewheeling approach he developed there has been transplanted to the restaurant. His cooking ranges avidly through flavors from around the globe, but what it expresses most clearly is the sheer pleasure of being set loose in the kitchen.\n        \n\n         That emotion came through more clearly in the smaller plates at Louro than in the larger meat or fish dishes, which tended to be forgettable. But it was palpable in the tempura-style triangles of piquillos with a lively stew of fresh chorizo that amplified the flavor of the sweet peppers. And it was there in the big orb of sweetbreads that he had treated like Southern fried chicken, serving it with a peppery white gravy and collard greens on the side.\n        \n\n         Louro is Mr. Santos\u2019s house, the first restaurant where he has had an ownership stake after unsatisfying gigs at Hotel Griffou and, more briefly, Five and Diamond.\n        \n\n         Rather than accept life as a journeyman, he stepped away from restaurants and started the supper club, cooking for about 16 people at a time in his home kitchen on Roosevelt Island. He called it Um Segredo, Portuguese for a secret. The name was accurate for a few weeks.\n        \n\n         With no boss to call the shots, he drew ideas from all over. He cooked menus inspired by Ernest Hemingway, Truman Capote and famous people born in January, from Jackie Robinson (a striped-bass corn dog) to Joan of Arc (game ravioli with smoked onions). One meal was a benefit to pay the veterinary bills of a sick dog, and another was assembled from items on Elvis\u2019s grocery lists at Graceland.\n        \n\n         Pilgrims to Roosevelt Island carried wine on the tram and, if conversation was halting at first, it rarely stayed that way. \u201cOnce that lubrication gets going, by the end of the night it gets pretty interesting, let\u2019s just say that,\u201d Mr. Santos said by phone.\n        \n\n         Whether it was the food or the lubrication, people enjoyed Um Segredo so much that when Mr. Santos held a Kickstarter campaign to help finance a place of his own, he got more than $25,000 in pledges.\n        \n\n         Louro doesn\u2019t seek to recreate the supper club experience apart from the Monday dinners. But the liberation Mr. Santos found at Um Segredo is all over his menus.\n        \n\n         One minute he might be on his way to Italy, frying tiny, perfectly delicate semolina gnocchi on one side until they look sun-tanned, then surrounding them with cream with black truffles. A topping of extraordinarily thin onion rings helped make the dish one that traveled around the table until it was gone.\n        \n\n         The next he is somewhere between Germany and Japan, pairing sea urchin and a sauerkraut variation made with the spice blend togarashi. The hot and salty pickled cabbage brought depth to the urchin, often used more for swoon than substance.\n        \n\n         Frequently and successfully, Mr. Santos is in Portugal, where his parents were born. His fish fritters with paprika aioli are improbably light; his shrimp in piri-piri sauce is the best I\u2019ve tasted.\n        \n\n         My praise for Louro would be louder, though, if the more substantial dishes were as satisfying.\n        \n\n         Mr. Santos is a seafood enthusiast, and his kitchen cooks it with care. Idaho trout with bacon, pecans and tiny brussels sprouts was pan-fried expertly. But at times, good fish was let down by bad partners, like the very flavorful piece of cobia that was becalmed in a watery curry-mussel emulsion. Chicken thigh confit and breast, too, were left to fend for themselves on a dull plate of oatmeal with a dribble of maple-sweetened jus. Dullness slipped into depression with a risotto of slightly undercooked lobster on gummy Himalayan red rice.\n        \n\n         The rise of small plates and tasting menus holds a danger: chefs may be starting to forget how to sustain interest beyond the first few bites. Saying that appetizers outshine main courses has become a clich\u00e9, but it is not a law of nature. It\u2019s a challenge to be overcome.\n        \n\n         Louro sometimes meets the challenge, but if you aren\u2019t feeling lucky, the menu has many other options. It has some very appealing desserts, too, simple-seeming things with an unexpected spice here or there, like the cardamom in a pineapple upside-down cake or the bay leaf ice cream with plums cooked in port.\n        \n\n         And there are the Monday dinners. When there\u2019s a big enough crowd, Louro will seat people at a big communal table in the back, recreating the spirit of the evenings that helped Mr. Santos remember why he cooks.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 218, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/20/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-louro-in-greenwich-village.html", "google_mag": 24.0}, {"review_text": "\n\n             Ferris\n            \n            manages to do a lot within the confines of its small space in the basement of the new Made hotel, south of Herald Square. At times it reminded me of one of those\n            \n             Leatherman tools\n            \n            that unfolds to reveal not just a knife and screwdriver but also a spoke wrench, fish scaler, eyelash curler, olive pitter, tuning fork and eel skinner.\n           \n\n            One recent night I sat at Ferris\u2019s seven-seat kitchen counter. I didn\u2019t realize that I was also sitting at Ferris\u2019s bar until the bartender standing in front of me had measured my drink, strained it into a stem glass and set it on a napkin, all without moving more than one step to the right or left.\n           \n\n            She had whipped up a citrus-sheathed gin number with a rustle of Chartreuse called a 388 C, and it was about as cheerful a kickoff to the dinner hour as anything I\u2019ve come across lately. In fact, almost all the drinks that Ferris\u2019s bartenders stir up in about four square feet of space are smarter and more bracing than what typically comes out of a full-size bar, and often they are poured into vintage etched glasses that any neo-speakeasy would envy.\n           \n\n            The cocktails encapsulate Ferris\u2019s most likable traits. It\u2019s a modest restaurant that overdelivers, cares about little details and has a personal, handmade sensibility. It doesn\u2019t quite give you the feeling of showing up at a friend\u2019s place for dinner, but it comes closer than a lot of places where that\u2019s the explicit aim.\n           \n\n            The illusion is aided by the carpentered interior. The single dining room, clad in raw two-by-eights, could be a suburban basement finished over the weekend by a couple with a table saw. A long cushioned bench built into one end of the room provides about half the seating, along with the stools at high tables and the counter.\n           \n\n            There\u2019s no lobby or reception area to speak of. If you arrive by elevator you\u2019re facing the kitchen, and if you take the stairs from the sidewalk you walk straight into the action in the dining room.\n           \n\n            Standing behind the counter and facing the customers is the chef, Greg Proechel. He is generally holding a knife and spends much of the night carving meat. His cooking has settled down since his last job, at\n            \n             Le Turtle\n            \n            , a deliberately odd French spot on Chrystie Street. There, he had some original ideas but didn\u2019t always seem to know the difference between the good ones and the bad ones.\n           \n\n            At Ferris, his only bad idea so far is trying to make roasted sunchokes into a main course, and by the time I gave up on the plate, filled out with smoked cabbage and sauced with scallion miso, I\u2019d decided that sunchokes themselves were more to blame than Mr. Proechel.\n           \n\n            He is on firmer ground with other vegetables: Okinawa sweet potatoes, their purple flesh mashed so it opens up to a splash of buttermilk and pumpkin mustard; or roasted beets with soft curls of fresh coconut, dressed in a dark tahini made from black sesame seeds; or charred stalks of broccolini with grapes and cashews (welcome back, cashews, we\u2019ve missed you) scattered over a cushion of yogurt spiced with Timur pepper \u2014 a relative of the Sichuan peppercorn.\n           \n\n            Agnolotti with a buttery and nearly liquid carrot filling are one of Ferris\u2019s more appealing main dishes; they\u2019re tossed with braised lamb neck. Maybe they would be slightly better without chips of crunchy raw carrot on top; contrary to popular belief, not every dish needs what chefs like to call texture.\n           \n\n            Mr. Proechel has a keen sense for contrasting flavors, though. He uses red pepper and sticky grilled dates to make what has to be the most exciting blood sausage in town. A chunk of grilled mackerel that any izakaya could be proud of sits in ponzu with \u2014 surprise \u2014 plums and an egg yolk cooked so that it looks and spreads like lemon curd.\n           \n\n            If you have heard anything at all about Le Turtle, then you know about the\n            \n             Sasso chicken\n            \n            that came to the table on a bed of smoldering hay with its head and feet still attached; it\n            \n             tasted great\n            \n            even though it looked as if the fire department had arrived too late at a four-alarm blaze in a chicken coop.\n           \n\n            Nothing at Ferris makes heads swivel and nostrils twitch in quite the same way, but if it\u2019s a table-annexing feast you want, then the c\u00f4te de boeuf with \u201call the fixings\u201d is the dish for you.\n           \n\n            Mr. Proechel has his own notions about \u201cfixings.\u201d I have never looked at a grilled beef rib and thought that what it really needed was a bowl of whipped buttermilk, but apparently he has, and I have to give him credit. Beating the buttermilk turns it into something between yogurt and whipped cream; mixing that with charred cipollini makes it into a particularly luxurious onion dip. There\u2019s also a paste of black garlic to serve as a super-concentrated steak sauce, and a shaved brussels sprout salad for relief from the richness. The only false move here was the sodden dumplings in broth, and they were easy enough to ignore in all the excitement.\n           \n\n            The danger of putting a firecracker like that on the menu is that the half of the dining room that didn\u2019t order it ends up staring glumly at the half that did. That was me, one night, looking at the women at the corner table who doted on their steak for an hour while I poked at my (perfectly all right) cod with clams and hazelnuts.\n           \n\n            When you are ready for something to drink with the c\u00f4te de boeuf, you run into another surprise of this Swiss Army knife of a restaurant: the versatile wine list, overseen by Jenny Lakin. It\u2019s not long, and it draws mainly from France and Italy, but it\u2019s been carefully drafted to include relative values from expensive regions and out-and-out values from less traveled areas.\n           \n\n            Ferris doesn\u2019t knock itself out for the dessert course. The few sweets are simple and pleasant, though, from the yuzu-lemon frozen yogurt to a dark chocolate mousse stuck with chips of jasmine meringue.\n           \n\n            Ms. Lakin\u2019s list carries over into dessert territory with amari, absinthes, liqueurs, eaux-de-vie and other end-of-the-night shots. Where all these bottles are stored I never figured out.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 219, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/dining/ferris-review-chelsea.html", "google_mag": 18.299999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n            The classic cafes of Parisian boulevards \u2014 rattan chairs and their occupants facing the sun in all but the nastiest weather, waiters stepping nimbly over small dogs \u2014 are central to the city\u2019s street culture, but they\u2019re pretty marginal to its eating and drinking culture now. Cafes may have been known for their namesake drink in Voltaire\u2019s day, but since then their coffee has become internationally notorious. Today the Parisian love of caffeine is more likely to be consummated over flat whites, cortados or, most un-French of all, filtered coffee at a third-wave espresso shop.\n           \n\n            Meanwhile the pillars of the cafe menu, those blunt salads and trusty omelets and utilitarian ham sandwiches, are not exactly drawing crowds like the shakshukas, pancakes, avocado toasts and acai bowls found at younger cafes like Ob-La-Di and\n            \n             Holybelly\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            With some searching, you can probably find cafes in France that produce the standards with conviction. Or you can go to\n            \n             La Mercerie\n            \n            , in SoHo, for simple, determinedly old-school French cooking with every detail in place. The chef, Marie-Aude Rose, does not make toasts, but she makes toast soldiers: sticks of white bread with butter smeared along their browned surfaces, but otherwise naked so they can drink up the orange yolk of a soft-cooked egg on a ceramic pedestal.\n           \n\n            For the past four months, Ms. Rose has been cooking as if the fate of the planet depended on the tenderness of her cheese omelets, the judiciousness of her vinaigrettes, the airy spaces in her croissants and the crackle of the buckwheat in her savory crepes.\n           \n\n            If those feats were as easy as they sound, La Mercerie\u2019s breakfast-through-dinner menu wouldn\u2019t be a major addition to the city\u2019s restaurant scene. But they aren\u2019t, and it is, and some of the thanks goes to Ms. Rose\u2019s hard-core training when she was embedded in the unforgiving kitchens of\n            \n             Guy Savoy\n            \n            and\n            \n             Pierre Gagnaire\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            Then, like a lot of aspiring chefs of her generation, she heard the call of the bistronomie movement, and went looking for a less cloistered restaurant. What she found was\n            \n             Spring\n            \n            , a new, relaxed, seasonally attentive place where an American named\n            \n             Daniel Rose\n            \n            was doing all the cooking himself. After she turned up, something clicked and the restaurant began to get attention around Paris and abroad. Her sensibilities overlapped with Mr. Rose\u2019s in other ways; the two started dating and later married, opening additional places along the way.\n           \n\n            The Roses moved to New York about two years ago when Daniel opened\n            \n             Le Coucou\n            \n            , his tribute to the Le and La restaurants of old. La Mercerie, three blocks west, was not in their plans until Le Coucou\u2019s chief owner,\n            \n             Stephen Starr\n            \n            , was brought on to operate a cafe inside a furniture and housewares store being planned by Le Coucou\u2019s design firm,\n            \n             Roman and Williams\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            La Mercerie sits at the junction of two mighty rivers of contemporary eating trends: the redundantly, if catchily, named all-day-cafe movement and the restaurant-as-shopping-catalog approach pursued by\n            \n             Jean-Georges Vongerichten\u2019s places\n            \n            inside ABC Carpet & Home.\n           \n\n            When you sit down for breakfast (or lunch, or dinner \u2014 see, all day) at La Mercerie, you will get, in addition to a menu, a card printed with small line drawings of every piece of tableware in the cafe, and its price. If you are very taken by the \u201crustic washed linen napkins\u201d\n            \n             you can buy a set\n            \n            for $104. For $275, there is a small teapot from a Danish potter who has supplied\n            \n             Noma\n            \n            . If this is outside your budget, you can still use them at La Mercerie for an hour or two before you have to give them back, like a rented tux of rustic washed linen.\n           \n\n            As borrowed lifestyles go, it\u2019s a pretty nice one. Many of the servers are dressed in high-waisted, loose-legged trousers and flowing white dress shirts, as if they were in costume for a Fred Astaire movie. Meanwhile, the customers never seem to be rushed or out of sorts, and I started to wonder if they were all extras being paid to sit there looking serene. Or maybe eating next to a room full of expensive vases, Swedish sheepskins, enormous woven baskets and antique tables makes everybody feel as if they are one of the exhibits in a small museum.\n           \n\n            The theme of the merchandise is craft \u2014 it\u2019s all handmade \u2014 and Ms. Rose has taken this to heart in her kitchen. La Mercerie\u2019s chicken bouillon is simmered and skimmed just the way it should be. Marked by balance and brightness, it is oolong tea to bone broth\u2019s double espresso. Also in the bowl are an egg with a liquid yolk and, down at the bottom, a flock of herb-pasta butterflies, each one the size of the tip of your pinkie.\n           \n\n            Ms. Rose\u2019s pastries are already some of the finest in the city. Croissants have crisp whorls on top that you can count like tree rings; the savory ones are filled with ham and Comt\u00e9, or broccoli and cherry tomatoes in custard, which may not sound good but is.\n           \n\n            More exotic is the tourteau fromag\u00e9, a palm-size cheesecake with a blackened, domed top. Born in Poitou-Charentes, it looks something like a Boston cream doughnut, but its interior is a moist, fine-crumbed cake that tastes, just barely, of fresh goat cheese. Ms. Rose serves it with a poached apricot in star-anise syrup. If you are a serious pastry watcher, you will want to add it to your life list.\n           \n\n            Having recently run up against a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e that seemed to contain no eggs and a plate of profiteroles allowed to get soggy at a purportedly French restaurant nearby, I was relieved to sink into the yolk-rich cr\u00e8me caramel and crisp choux puffs under bittersweet chocolate sauce at La Mercerie. A devout and often disappointed Francophile I ate with eyed the crepes au sucre warily. \u201cThe sugar had better be crunchy,\u201d she said. It was, of course.\n           \n\n            The menu changes once a day, at noon. The soft-cooked egg goes away, replaced by the omelet. Four main courses arrive, including a very nice piece of roasted salmon with red-wine sauce. Salads appear.\n           \n\n            It is almost impossible to rave convincingly about salads, so please trust me that La Mercerie\u2019s are great, particularly the ni\u00e7oise, with tuna preserved in oil on the premises and anchovies cured in oil at the source, the Cantabrian Sea.\n           \n\n            The same anchovies, swimming on the same plate as a wedge of vanilla butter, make an appetizer that you probably won\u2019t believe until you\u2019ve tasted it. (The butter amplifies the richness of the fish while tamping down its sharpness.) The man who churns La Mercerie\u2019s butter,\n            \n             Jean-Yves Bordier\n            \n            , does not sell his stuff to just anybody, and the fat slices of his buckwheat and lemon-olive oil butters are worth the $7 you pay.\n           \n\n            Most things are so precisely as they should be that it is hard to find fault. But I am not sure that a sheet of Calvados-poached apple is of much use to a wedge of Camembert, and I wish that the boeuf bourguignon\u2019s dark and lovely sauce did not slide so easily off the smooth macaroni Ms. Rose sets under the stew. Maybe the buckwheat crepe curled above the creamed chicken reminded me a bit too much of a dosa. But the one around ham, Comt\u00e9 and a fried egg is reassuringly folded like an envelope.\n           \n\n            The wine list is full of the amenably drinkable bottles you want with this food. As for the coffee, it too is drinkable \u2014 one of the rare departures from French cafe tradition.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 220, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/dining/la-mercerie-review-soho.html", "google_mag": 29.5}, {"review_text": "\n         If there are tweezers in the kitchen of\n         \n          MP Taverna Astoria\n         \n         , they are banned from all tasks except, perhaps, yanking bones from branzino fillets before they go on the grill. Tweezers are definitely not asked to airlift feathery microgreens onto plates that endeavor to be meditations on negative space.\n        \n\n         The kind of tool that might be used to put together a bowl of MP Taverna\u2019s marvelous ricotta dumplings would be something like a large ice cream scoop. The soft, round gnudi, the ricotta\u2019s young milkiness given depth by gratings of aged graviera from\n         \n\n\n          Crete\n         \n         , are piled around and around with pine nuts, crumbled feta, heaps of spinach and sun-dried tomatoes. There are spicy bites of lamb sausage everywhere, and a garlicky tomato sauce with white wine. It isn\u2019t a dish you meditate on. It\u2019s one you demolish, forkful by forkful.\n        \n\n         The same goes for the grilled octopus appetizer, many tender sticks of it, lightly charred and piled all around with chickpeas, black-eyed peas, red peppers and parsley above a small lake of yogurt and golden olive oil. \u00a0Golden fillets of lightly cured and deep-fried cod get two sauces, a glossy bed of garlicky skordalia and a blanket of tomato sauce that\u2019s half sweet and half sharp. Then they\u2019re shingled over with a roof of grilled bread sprinkled with lemon juice and tomato water. The only delicate thing about the restaurant\u2019s abundant, lusty plates is the prices: $8.50 for the cod, $11 for the octopus and $15 for the dumplings, a main course that I couldn\u2019t finish, though I wanted to.\n        \n\n         The MP of this crowded, unrestrained take on a Greek taverna is the chef\n         \n\n\n          Michael Psilakis\n         \n         . Those who remember his earlier odes to\n         \n\n\n          Greece\n         \n         \u2014 sung elegantly at\n         \n          Anthos\n         \n         , soulfully at\n         \n          Onera\n         \n         \u2014 may wish more of his old finesse had survived the trip from\n         \n\n\n          Manhattan\n         \n         to\n         \n\n\n          Queens\n         \n         . But MP Taverna broadcasts its intentions from the minute the host walks you past the bar, where TVs embedded in the wall are playing the\n         \n\n\n          Mets\n         \n         , and hands you a poster-size menu in a plastic sheath, diner style. (An upstairs dining room is quieter and more comfortable.)\n        \n\n         Unlike a diner, though, MP Taverna turns over the back of its menu to a list of about six dozen wines by the half glass, full glass, half bottle and full bottle, and about as many beers, nearly all from craft breweries. A hefty share of the wines shows off the skill of Greek winemakers, including a 2011 Ritinitis Nobilis from Gaia Estate, the first retsina I\u2019ve ever made peace with.\n        \n\n         That list gives space to\n         \n\n\n          France\n         \n         ,\n         \n\n\n          Italy\n         \n         ,\n         \n\n\n          Austria\n         \n         and the United States, too. This isn\u2019t unusual on its own, but it reflects one of Mr. Psilakis\u2019s aims for MP Taverna. The son of Greek immigrants, he has battled his whole career to win respect for the food of his family. His early Manhattan restaurants were sophisticated, elite campaigns. With his MP Taverna, a high-volume proposition with branches outside the city in Roslyn and Irvington, N.Y., he takes the struggle to the streets.\n        \n\n         MP Taverna offers a second-generation, melting-pot vision of an America where Greek flavors have been woven into the fabric of American cooking so thoroughly that they\u2019re taken for granted. If yogurt companies can do it, why not chefs?\n        \n\n         In this America, dense white cubes of feta pickled in wood barrels are widely recognized as an appetizer that can hold its own with burrata. Tender gigantes are a natural addition to mussels neatly arranged in a skillet. And cooks who rely on the salty, porky charms of sausage are apt to round out a dish with caul-wrapped sheftalia, which is a favorite in\n         \n\n\n          Cyprus\n         \n         , or loukaniko, made at MP Taverna with leeks and orange peel.\n        \n\n         Those sausages, along with merguez, lend terrific flavor wherever they turn up at MP Taverna, and they turn up a lot, though not under those names. (At times they run circles around their companions; the hanger steak served with loukaniko and the pork tenderloin in a mixed grill can\u2019t quite keep up.) Even the great beef sliders, pressed into gyro spice mix before they\u2019re griddled, and the lamb burger, seasoned with onion, scallion and garlic and then wrapped in caul and grilled, have strong sausagelike tendencies.\n        \n\n         The flavors are so robust and the prices so unassuming that I was ready to overlook moments when a little more finesse wouldn\u2019t have been out of place: the acrid garlic cloves riding on the coattails of the roast chicken with a rich lemon-dill sauce; the fried squid that had no flavor at all; the hopelessly underseasoned pilaf with head-on prawns; the grilled watermelon that tasted as if it had been slapped down on the same part of the grate where fish is cooked.\n        \n\n         One night, servers kept fumbling the simple mechanics of who gets what when. Food and drinks landed in front of the wrong person, and the main courses came while we still had our appetizers. Without asking if we were finished, the servers cleared one plate at a time to make space for a main course. For a few messy minutes half-eaten dishes and fresh new ones sat side by side.\n        \n\n         But the servers were eager and cheerful, as they were on more-coordinated nights. And a few off dishes were never enough to threaten the overall impression that MP Taverna is Mr. Psilakis\u2019s best restaurant in the city, at least for now. On the Upper West Side,\n         \n          Kefi\n         \n         has been closed since a ruptured water main flooded it in February. Mr. Psilakis hopes to open it in three months. A few blocks away is his other surviving Manhattan restaurant, Fishtag.\n        \n\n         Yes, Fishtag survives. Sam Sifton\n         \n          gave it a Fair rating\n         \n         in a\n         \n\n\n          New York Times\n         \n         review in 2011. Not long after, the restaurant lost its chef, Ryan Skeen, who has left so many kitchens so rapidly he has to be considered a flight risk. Two years on, Fishtag is often full at 8, and everybody looks content. On an initial visit, I was, too. I loved raw kale with smoked trout, some of it flaked to coat the raw greens and some left in big meaty pieces. Sheep-milk dumplings, close cousins of the ricotta ones at MP Taverna, were just as seductive at Fishtag with crab meat and peppery speck.\n        \n\n         But at a second meal, the kitchen seemed to have the summertime blues. Scallops in a ceviche were a flavorless nonentity, very good smoked octopus suffered from an olive-date pur\u00e9e that ran far too sweet, and grilled striped bass looked as if it had been on the wrong end of a bar fight.\n        \n\n         I wouldn\u2019t travel more than a block or two for a meal like that. But I\u2019d go back to Astoria.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 221, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-mp-taverna-astoria-in-queens.html", "google_mag": 25.200000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n         In some corners of the food media, the opening of Andrew Carmellini\u2019s new restaurant, Lafayette, was written about the way successful nuclear tests are covered on North Korean television.

Apart, perhaps, from Daniel Boulud, no chef in town is better equipped to make that cuisine relevant and exciting again than Mr. Carmellini. A walking Larousse Gastronomique, he spent six years at\n         \n          Caf\u00e9 Boulud\n         \n         working within the traditions of France as gracefully as he danced around them.\n        \n\n         Given a NoHo corner lot with miles of windows, the restaurant Mr. Carmellini came up with is like a junior Eataly for Francophiles. There is a pastry shop and bakery, a cocktail bar and an all-French wine list. Damon Wise, an ace technician from Craft and the Monkey Bar hired by Mr. Carmellini as chef de cuisine, wears a toque as he oversees an open kitchen where chickens on spits slowly give up their melting fat. All of this is packed inside the brass-and-mirrors skin of a brasserie that stays open from morning to midnight or thereabouts.\n        \n\n         As for the food, there are salads and charcuterie and oysters and shoestring fries. Almost all of it is worthy, but very little seduces you. Lafayette wants you to fall in love with it, but it tries too hard in some ways and not hard enough in others. It\u2019s a restaurant that is a little too easy to place in the friend zone.\n        \n\n         The nonromance starts at the door. One night when a private party had taken over the basement, Lafayette let large, unfunny security men with earpieces stop diners on the sidewalk for questioning. One prospective guest with a reservation said he was on his way inside to meet somebody. \u201cFor what?\u201d came the reply.\n        \n\n         When Lafayette\u2019s staff members were handling first impressions themselves, the greeting was not always warmer. One night I was briskly packed off to the bar and ordered to come back and tell the hosts when the rest of my party had arrived, even though my other guests were sure to check in before searching for me.\n        \n\n         Nobody seems to have helped the servers pronounce simple French words on the menu. Specials weren\u2019t mentioned until I asked, and a menu change (trout in place of dorade) wasn\u2019t disclosed until I ordered it. A basket of country bread was placed directly in front of the only woman at the table, as if she were supposed to eat the whole thing herself.\n        \n\n         This wouldn\u2019t be such a bad fate; baked by James Belisle, the bread is outstanding, with a dense, mildly tangy rye and whole wheat crumb beneath a thick band of crust that shatters with a noise like a motorcycle boot stepping on a bag of potato chips. But the service at a restaurant as busy as Lafayette needs a brisk professionalism leavened with charm, or else you start to feel as if you are eating in the largest and most elegant\n         \n          Pain Quotidien\n         \n         in the five boroughs. The details matter.\n        \n\n         Luckily Mr. Wise and Jennifer Yee, the pastry chef, are as detail-oriented as they come. Ms. Yee is a master of classic tarts (both a cherry-almond frangipane tart and figs baked on a wheel of puff pastry were high points not just of the meal but of the month); modern French desserts (her charred mango with toasted coconut and lime parfait is a sunny and sophisticated tropical holiday); and, for good measure, all-American classics (she makes a great whole-wheat carrot muffin, which should be an oxymoron. The muffins are sold at the bakery counter alongside my favorite almond croissant in the city and other viennoiseries baked by Mr. Belisle).\n        \n\n         My meals leading up to dessert were often very good, even if they didn\u2019t always reach the same highs. The red-wine sauce in tripe bourguignon is a terrific achievement: fruity but not sharp or winy, it has a bittersweet richness like good dark chocolate. The pastas, too, were reliably impressive, like the little postage stamps of ravioli filled with goat cheese and squirted with a pesto that had a just-picked freshness, or the fleur de soleil, tender and silky little flowers tossed with snap peas, pancetta and mint.\n        \n\n         The eggs Lafayette, hard cooked with smoked sable heaped into the yolk hollows and trout roe gleaming on top, tasted like three or four great brunch dishes in one small, luxurious package.\n        \n\n         Duck breast au poivre under pinwheels of candied kumquat had a more concentrated and meatier flavor than some steaks, although the watery disks of braised radish remained on my plate.\n        \n\n         Sometimes a modern tidiness goes too far, though. The seasoning on a neat patty of beef tartare was too polite and the fris\u00e9e salad was too prim, with dainty bits of house-made bacon and an egg cooked too long to melt into the vinaigrette.\n        \n\n         A bouillabaisse that could have been the best in town was undercut by its serving dish, photogenic but impractical. The lobster tail, langoustine, mussels and monkfish were all handsomely cooked, and the shellfish broth was wonderfully aromatic with saffron and pastis. But spreading it all out in a shallow copper braising pan meant that both seafood and sauce were tepid within minutes.\n        \n\n         It\u2019s now off the menu. I hope it\u2019s simply gone to Williams-Sonoma to buy itself a deep porcelain bowl, because a spectacular bouillabaisse could help Lafayette get out of the friend zone. The by-the-book pork p\u00e2t\u00e9 won\u2019t do it. Neither will the rotisserie chicken. Tender and flavorful as it is, it still puts you in mind of\n         \n          Fairway\n         \n         , not\n         \n          Chez l\u2019Ami Louis\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         Profoundly sweet and fresh scallops won\u2019t do it, either, not if they are languishing in a nondescript pea pur\u00e9e surrounded by a meek spoonful of morel jus. Another chef-engineered burger won\u2019t do it, even if this one, served at lunch, gets its terrific flavor from ground brisket, and neither will a soft-shell crab on a toasted brioche. The crab is faultless, but the sandwich belongs in another restaurant. The name of that restaurant is the Dutch.\n        \n\n         Dishes that would be equally at home there, or at Locanda Verde, are everywhere. This may make fans of those restaurants feel welcome. It may also help Mr. Carmellini move cooks from one kitchen to another. But it doesn\u2019t give Lafayette the strong point of view that would make it feel like something more than a good choice in the neighborhood of the Public Theater. Of all the adjectives that might describe a French restaurant built by Andrew Carmellini, Lafayette brings to mind the last one I would have expected: optional.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 222, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-lafayette-in-noho.html", "google_mag": 24.600000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n         At Carbone, they don\u2019t ask if you\u2019ve dined with them before. Even if you haven\u2019t, the answer would still be yes. This is supposed to be the Italian restaurant where you celebrated your birthday before anyone told you that chicken scarpariello isn\u2019t Italian.\n        \n\n         This being 2013, and the two chefs,\n         \n          Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone\n         \n         , being former lieutenants of\n         \n          Mario Batali\n         \n         and\n         \n          Daniel Boulud\n         \n         , Carbone is infinitely more self-conscious than those old restaurants. It is a fancy red-sauce joint in Greenwich Village as directed by\n         \n\n\n          Quentin Tarantino\n         \n         , bringing back the punch-in-the-guts thrills of a genre that everybody else sees as uncultured and a little embarrassing, while exposing the sophistication that was always lurking there. Carbone has a technical prowess that can make you giddy; a lust for excess that can, at times, make you a little queasy; and an instinct for sheer entertainment that makes a lot of other restaurants seem like earnest, unimaginative drones.\n        \n\n         There are, in the Tarantino style, fanboy film allusions: the\n         \n          tile floor from \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d\n         \n         the narrow passageway into the back dining room that makes you feel like\n         \n\n\n          Ray Liotta\n         \n         handshake-tipping his way into the Copacabana.\n        \n\n         There are the songs that make you think, \u201cOh, no,\u201d followed by \u201cI forgot how great this is,\u201d as people with open bottles of Gaja on the table drum their fingers to\n         \n          \u201cWe Open in Venice.\u201d\n         \n\n\n         Like Tarantino\u2019s love letters to pulpy exploitation films, Carbone affectionately picks up the clich\u00e9s of its genre, twirls them, then hurls them at your head. Our captain wears a B-movie smile and a tuxedo in a shade of maroon last seen at Liberace\u2019s estate sale. Bearing a hollowed-out wheel of Parmesan, he stabs a nugget of cheese and slides it on to my plate. It tastes young, milky and uninteresting, but next come papery slices of smoky and complex aged country ham,\n         \n\n\n          Kentucky\n         \n         serving as a stunt double for Parma, and a stack of \u201cgrandma bread,\u201d a no-cheese Sicilian pizza with oregano and a shadowy, sweet pulp of tomato sauce. Both make me smile.\n        \n\n         More unbidden genre tropes are on the way: tart giardiniera in oil, amazing garlic bread, fried ribbons of dough under powdered sugar, suave fig grappa, and delicate house-made limoncello in a bottle furry with frost. I don\u2019t love every one of these extras, but I love the way they make me abandon any hope of quiet moderation.\n        \n\n         Nearly the entire menu at Carbone is a quotation, starting with the $50 veal parm, which is larger than some fancy brick-oven pizzas and looks like one, too, with ovals of browned buffalo mozzarella and a bright red, summer-fresh, barely cooked tomato sauce. Served with a fried shaft of bone, it\u2019s a shock-and-awe dish, and the most shocking thing about it is that there is no real revisionism here; it is a veal parm, the way you always hoped it would be.\n        \n\n         More often, the old tropes get an injection of technique that acts like a syringe of\n         \n\n\n          epinephrine\n         \n         plunged into the heart. The two-and-a-half pound lobster fra diavolo is both brash and polished, the huge portion galvanized by Calabrian chiles and soothed by Cognac. No shrimp scampi has been handled as gently or luxuriously as Carbone\u2019s chorus line of langoustines, claws extended, bodies split and slick with butter that implies garlic without coming right out and saying it.\n        \n\n         Concentrated shellfish stock is the foundation a zuppa di pesce so deeply fragrant, you know it\u2019s coming before it\u2019s on the table.\n        \n\n         I wish the clam broth that infuses linguine vongole had the same intensity. But other plates of what Carbone calls \u201cmacaroni\u201d are remarkable. Knuckles of tortellini stuffed with whipped sheep\u2019s milk ricotta are a show of zero-gravity delicacy while elbows of rigatoni are forceful and substantial, their tomato sauce unabashedly spicy and slyly buttery.\n        \n\n         There are also, in this movie, some lapses in taste and judgment. Fried broccoli rabe is locked inside some of the heaviest, greasiest batter I\u2019ve ever tasted. Carbone\u2019s tiramis\u00f9, a wedge of layer cake with mascarpone between Marsala-soaked spongecake, is too wet and too boozy, a case where the middlebrow original is better than the highbrow makeover.\n        \n\n         Strangest of all is something called Chinese chicken, which tastes as if Mr. Torrisi and Mr. Carbone were trying to recreate something from Chinatown Night at their college cafeterias. But old Italian-American restaurants generally have at least one dish on the menu that nobody orders. Maybe this soy-and-sesame-seed nonentity is supposed to be another in-joke, although it would be funnier if, when you ordered it, your captain said, \u201cWe just sold out.\u201d\n        \n\n         They could get a laugh out of it, too. Carbone\u2019s captains are character actors who have mastered the jokey, swaggering, slightly bossy style that was a New York specialty before waiters began to have the blandly pleasant manners of the young people who carry Bibles and ring doorbells on Saturday mornings. There is a flash of three-card monte below the surface, as these men sell you on meatballs with your pasta or promise that the lemon cheesecake is \u201cthe best you\u2019ll ever have in your life.\u201d They aren\u2019t lying about the cheesecake, though.\n        \n\n         And the most talented among them can improvise dialogue while grating creamy ricotta salata over a Caesar salad that is just as sharp with anchovies as you could wish. One night a star of romantic comedies was sharing one appetizer and one main course with her male date. When the date left the table, the captain leaned in.\n        \n\n         Captain: Nice catch.\n        \n\n         Star: Excuse me?\n        \n\n         Captain: I said that\u2019s a good-looking young man you\u2019re with.\n        \n\n         Star: (Raucous laughter.)\n        \n\n         This kind of thing is funny only if you agree to play along. And I\u2019m not ready to play along with all of Carbone\u2019s casting decisions: currently all the captains, typically the most highly tipped employees, are men.\n        \n\n         But I admire nearly all the other choices that Mr. Torrisi, Mr. Carbone and their business partner, Jeff Zalaznick, have made. Many American restaurants are trying to reinvent fine dining by looking abroad. Carbone is mining the best elements of homegrown American style of service and cuisine that flourished when men in ties and women in heels, woozy from a final shot of sambuca, wobbled to the sidewalk clutching doggy bags.\n        \n\n         We didn\u2019t know how good we had it. Carbone is here to remind us.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 223, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-carbone-in-manhattan.html", "google_mag": 22.399999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n            Anita Lo has been the chef of Annisa since it opened almost 14 years ago, and summing up her style has not gotten any easier. Even she, when naming the cookbook she wrote with Charlotte Druckman, defined her style by what it is not. The title is\n            \n             \u201cCooking Without Borders.\u201d\n            \n\n\n            What is remarkable about her food, though, is not exactly the absence of borders but the ease with which she crosses them. Take the stunner of a Spanish mackerel dish that I ate there a few months ago. After marinating in sweetened soy sauce, the fish is blistered under a hot salamander, flesh side down, until the skin is crunchy with a bittersweet char. This is not far off from the way a Japanese cook may handle mackerel, but Ms. Lo\u2019s passport will be stamped a few more times before she\u2019s done.\n           \n\n            In Hong Kong, she will pick up some\n            \n             fried milk\n            \n            , golden battered globes of squishy-soft pudding made from condensed milk. The oily mackerel could demolish the meek taste of milk with one flick of its fin, so she builds in depth by blending the pudding with mellow roasted garlic and, after a quick shopping run to Southeast Asia, fish sauce. For the brick-red paste beneath the mackerel she pops over to Seoul for gochujang, funky and unabashedly hot.\n           \n\n            At last, Ms. Lo returns to Japan for creamy cubes of roasted satsumaimo, the yellow sweet potato. By now she had racked up frequent flier miles by the thousands, but what my mouth noticed were the exhilarating runs from one pole of flavor to another, from sugary to savory, soothing to fiery, nuanced to potent. The far-flung elements were anything but all over the map; they touched down precisely where Ms. Lo wanted them, and I followed along, hungrily.\n           \n\n            Free-form creativity like Ms. Lo\u2019s is rare. To explain it, we often fall back on family history. Ms. Lo\u2019s mother is Chinese, from Malaysia. Her father was Chinese, too, from Shanghai, but he died before she knew him, and she was raised in Michigan by her mother and a non-Chinese stepfather. As a girl she ate Chinese food, Hungarian food and American food, and marked her birthdays with steamed lobster. The two chefs who taught her much of what she knows about professional kitchens were David Waltuck and\n            \n             David Bouley\n            \n            . Many of the techniques they imparted are French, but the chefs are not. Biography takes you only so far.\n           \n\n            Ms. Lo will tell you that the taste of her mother\u2019s cooking made its way into Annisa\u2019s soup dumplings. They have been on the menu from the beginning, and can still startle with their seductive filling of foie gras mousse in a thick, glistening broth seasoned with ginger, star anise and cinnamon.\n           \n\n            But the hot-and-numbing Sichuan-inspired sauce on another remarkable appetizer, a hearts of palm salad, owes its presence on the plate to\n            \n             Ms. Lo\u2019s roving curiosity.\n            \n            So does the main ingredient, hearts of palm that are shipped overnight to Greenwich Village by a farmer she met on Oahu. They are grilled just enough to soften them without taking anything away from their fresh, quiet, rounded sweetness.\n           \n\n            Annisa\u2019s impressive beef tartare, chopped by a knife and chilled so it is the opposite of mushy, borrows its cinnamon and steamed bulgur from the family recipe of Annisa\u2019s sous-chef, Mary Attea, whose father is Lebanese. Ms. Lo\u2019s ear has always been attuned to the lilt of the Middle East. You can also catch it in an elegant main course of roasted rabbit loin stuffed with chopped pistachios and grape leaves with a thick and lemony yogurt sauce.\n           \n\n            In a few of the main courses, Ms. Lo\u2019s skill at layering flavors didn\u2019t quite manage to maintain interest in larger expanses of fish or meat. I wished that every piece of roasted lamb had been as remarkable as the brooding stew of merguez meatballs that came with it, or that the warm avocado dice had brought more fizz to an admirably well-grilled cobia fillet. In the slightly smaller portions of a five-course dealer\u2019s choice tasting menu for $85, that trouble disappeared.\n           \n\n            Ms. Lo devises the desserts herself, but if you are still trying to figure out which box she fits into when they arrive, I\u2019d suggest you give up and enjoy yourself. Multicultural syncopation gives way to more homey pleasures like a banana and peanut butter \u201ctower.\u201d It must be a tower that fell over, because it is short and flat like a napoleon.\n           \n\n            You can\u2019t draw any conclusions about the person who made the long plank of poppy-seed bread pudding, which has twice as much toasted surface as usual and a pool of creamy lemon curd to swish it around in, except that she must really like eating dessert. (The feeling evidently doesn\u2019t extend to bread, based on the perfunctory dinner rolls. The little dish of retro butter curls is good for a smile, though.)\n           \n\n            The space in which these pleasures play out is remarkable for how unremarkable it is. The dining room sits a few steps above Barrow Street, where you can watch terriers wearing warm jackets and disapproving expressions take their evening walk. The canine fashion parade is virtually the only distraction from food and conversation.\n           \n\n            Around 10 one evening, when a few tables had emptied, a friend asked a question nobody ever asks in most new restaurants: \u201cHave they been playing music all night?\u201d Every week I get emails from readers who say they feel unwelcome in restaurants that have industrial noise levels, congested dining rooms, penitential chairs and subterranean lighting. Annisa is free of these annoyances. I don\u2019t think anyone of any age who enjoys going out to eat would feel out of place there.\n           \n\n            Service is graceful and unfussy, although perhaps not quite as watchful as it was before Annisa\u2019s other founder, Jennifer Scism,\n            \n             moved to Maine\n            \n            a few years ago. One night, as my guest stood by the door, a host asked how she had enjoyed dinner. It was nice of her to wonder, and would have been even nicer a couple of hours later, after we had eaten. Still, the overall tone Ms. Scism set, one of maturity and inclusiveness that Sam Sifton called \u201crare and noteworthy\u201d in\n            \n             his two-star review\n            \n            in The New York Times from 2010, still prevails.\n           \n\n            Today, Annisa deserves a third star. Ms. Lo pulled out of a dumpling side project shortly after that review, and it may be that the restaurant has benefited from her undivided attention. She may never have an empire, but she has a superb Greenwich Village restaurant. Then again, it\u2019s just as likely that time has simply made it more clear how singular Annisa is. It\u2019s still not easy to say what Ms. Lo\u2019s style is, but it is hers, and hers alone, and the city is a more exciting place for it.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 224, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/dining/restaurant-review-annisa-in-greenwich-village.html", "google_mag": 28.0}, {"review_text": "\n         Crunching on grilled pig snouts at a Thai restaurant in\n         \n\n\n          Brooklyn\n         \n         the other night, I reflected on how far New York has come.\n        \n\n         The snouts and I were in Whiskey Soda Lounge Ny, which the chef Andy Ricker opened in August. It serves as a way station where people can nosh and drink and watch Muay Thai highlight reels while waiting for a table at Mr. Ricker\u2019s\n         \n          Pok Pok Ny\n         \n         down the street.

New Yorkers will pinch raw tripe in miso between chopsticks at\n         \n          Takashi\n         \n         in the West Village, rip crisp folds of grilled chicken skin from skewers at\n         \n          Hanjan\n         \n         in Chelsea, and line up for the softer morsels of a lamb\u2019s head at the scattered outposts of\n         \n          Xi\u2019an Famous Foods\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         Our pain threshold for spice is rapidly climbing, too. Blistering Isan cuisine has been taking over the Thai scene, and incendiary Sichuan food is turning up all over, riding a great orange tide of chile oil.\n        \n\n         Whiskey Soda Lounge, in the Columbia Street Waterfront District in Brooklyn, feeds the city\u2019s appetites for both spice and novelty. To tell the truth, that pig snout was so leathery that chewing on it was like getting nourishment from an old football. But I dug into the crunchy pig tails and invitingly tender pork tongue beside it on the plate, a constant special, dipping them into a dark and intense sauce called jaew, made from soy, dried chilies and toasted ground rice. Jaew turned up again with deep-fried strips of marinated pork called muu sawan, a sweet, crunchy and irresistible species of jerky.\n        \n\n         Offal anchors the tom saep muu, a clay-pot soup in which a vivid hot-and-sour pork broth elevates the blunt flavors of chopped heart, liver and tripe. One spoonful reminds you that the first cook who combined chilies, lemon grass, Kaffir lime, galangal and lime juice deserved a\n         \n\n\n          Nobel Prize\n         \n         for aromatic sciences.\n        \n\n         The soup and some other spicy dishes are not murderously hot, but they are not meek, either. The dressings on two excellent salads \u2014 yam plaa meuk, or squid with tomatoes and celery, and yam het huu nuu khao, tomatoes and scallions with ruffled white mouse-ear mushrooms \u2014 had the kind of warmth you feel in your joints, not the kind that makes you want a tongue transplant.\n        \n\n         There are gentler dishes, too. A deep-fried Thai analogue to Scotch eggs, khai luuk khoei, comes with a relatively nonincendiary tamarind dipping sauce, although you can crank up the heat with bits of toasted dried chilies. One of Mr. Ricker\u2019s most lovable hits, the Vietnamese-style chicken wings marinated in fish sauce and garlic, can be ordered spicy or less spicy, and neither version is as fierce as the kind you\u2019d find in a sports bar.\n        \n\n         Drink a cocktail if spiciness becomes an issue. Drink a cocktail in any case, because the ones at Whiskey Soda Lounge, like Pok Pok Ny, are fun and refreshing, and because the food almost demands it. Few items, except for maybe the wings, are substantial enough to be main courses. Still, you can easily put together a satisfying meal out of a few snacks, a salad and divots of sticky rice. It isn\u2019t a going-out-to-dinner kind of night, but it makes a great field trip with one or two other bar-stool travelers.\n        \n\n         Khe-Yo, opened in July by the chef Marc Forgione and Soulayphet Schwader, one of his longtime cooks, works the other way around. It\u2019s easy to navigate the menu, with appetizers and main courses heavy on animal protein serving as recognizable landmarks. But while much of the food is very appealing, not all of it makes you feel as if you\u2019ve left home.\n        \n\n         The most intriguing flavors hide out in Khe-Yo\u2019s sauces. Grilled black bass that comes to the table with its blackened head staring up like a totem is ordinary until you wrap it in lettuce with a funky, salty jam of tamarind and peanuts. This makes it great. A similar transformation happens when you dip the sesame beef jerky in a thick paste of assorted dried smoked chilies pounded with galangal. The condiment is as dark and glossy as shoe polish, and the peppers contribute both fruitiness and spice that make it wonderfully complex.\n        \n\n         Meals at Khe-Yo always begin with sticky rice in a bamboo basket, along with two sauces. One is an eggplant mash, with the funky, salty taste of fish sauce. The other is called bang-bang sauce, fresh red chilies and cilantro pounded in a mortar with lime juice and fish sauce. Its genuine heat can improve some of the underspiced dishes you might run into later on, like the excessively mild-mannered laap salads (the one with sliced duck breast and braised and fried tongues is the most compelling) and the lackluster grilled chicken. It doesn\u2019t help the meek papaya salad, though, which needs more chilies before it leaves the kitchen.\n        \n\n         Servers invariably described the sticky rice and sauce combo as \u201cour bread and butter service.\u201d This hand-holding feels superfluous for New York in 2013, as does the repeated instruction to wrap food and herbs in lettuce to \u201ccreate your own perfect bite.\u201d The cooking of\n         \n\n\n          Laos\n         \n         is rare in the city, to be sure, but certain dishes and ingredients overlap with those of northern Thailand next door, and at this late date the lettuce wrap probably needs no introduction.\n        \n\n         A highly skilled cook with a sharp eye for ingredients, Mr. Schwader was born in Laos and moved to\n         \n\n\n          Kansas\n         \n         with his family when he was 3 years old. Right now his menu is a little more timidly westernized than it needs to be, but his kitchen may become bolder as he gets a sense of how far New Yorkers are willing to go.\n        \n\n         Meanwhile, diners hungry to try a few Lao dishes in unreconstructed form can go a few blocks south to\n         \n          Mangez Avec Moi\n         \n         at 71-73 West Broadway, (212) 385-0008. Its name isn\u2019t promising, nor is its \u201cauthentic pan-Asian cuisine\u201d tagline. But after 4 p.m., the chef, Jeannie Ongkeo, sends out a short Lao menu.\n        \n\n         Her papaya salad hummed with fresh chilies and fermented seafood, and her nam kao, a crispy rice salad with shredded coconut, had a taut balance of hot, sour, salty and sweet. My favorite was \u201cor stew,\u201d a murky bowl of slippery mushrooms and eggplant cooked with Kaffir lime, lemon grass and branches of fresh dill. It was the first time I\u2019ve tasted flavors quite like it, but I hope not the last.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 226, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-khe-yo-in-tribeca-and-whiskey-soda-lounge-ny-in-brooklyn.html", "google_mag": 25.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n         First, the bad news. The restaurant under my microscope today is in a basement. It is closed four nights out of seven. Its sole offering is a $100 tasting menu that is not posted in advance. Substitutions are not allowed. And the name is impossible to say with a straight face: Le Restaurant.\n        \n\n         Now the good news. The basement, under a food market in TriBeCa called\n         \n          All Good Things\n         \n         , is a cozy place. The blond furniture, the pair of white candles suspended from a long row of wooden coat pegs, and the smell of wood smoke all transport you out of New York to some other place \u2014 maybe a soothing, if somber, cabin by a Swedish lake.\n        \n\n         In the coming weeks, the narrow window of dinner service will be thrown open to five nights. Finally, if you are an omnivore, if you dream about uncommon ingredients and pure, focused flavors, then Ryan Tate\u2019s tasting menus are absolutely worth it.\n        \n\n         A dinner in April began with salmon mousse sandwiched between airy fennel-seed meringues. The flavors were gentle, but they got my attention, and the next course drew me in deeper. Here were gooseneck barnacles, long tubes ending in multifaceted beaks; they looked like the sawed-off legs of a Victorian piano. Swiped in melted butter and chopped spring garlic, the barnacles tasted a bit like the necks of steamer clams, but they were far more tender and much sweeter.\n        \n\n         Half of a roasted bird showed up next, its one leg stretched out, its foot curled in. It was a woodcock, one of the most prized game birds. That foot was weird but the meat was good, ruddy, juicy and strong. Just before dessert, I had my first bite of water buffalo. The soft and mild roasted loin wasn\u2019t as deeply satisfying as beef or bison, but still I went home wondering why we Americans eat the same three or four species almost every night and then complain that the main course wasn\u2019t as interesting as the appetizer.\n        \n\n         Mr. Tate, Le Restaurant\u2019s chef and a partner, wonders, too.\n        \n\n         \u201cI\u2019m always looking for alternatives to the status quo of \u00a0beef, chicken, lamb,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cThese are things we\u2019ve all tasted hundreds of times if we\u2019re carnivores.\u201d\n        \n\n         In his last job, he got a glimpse of the status quo repeated indefinitely. He was the chef de cuisine of\n         \n          Savoy\n         \n         , in SoHo, when\n         \n          Ed Levine proclaimed\n         \n         on the\n         \n          Serious Eats\n         \n         blog that Savoy\u2019s cheeseburger \u201cdeserves a place in New York\u2019s burger pantheon.\u201d Suddenly almost every customer wanted dinner on a bun.\n        \n\n         At Le Restaurant, which he opened in March, variety reigns. Mr. Tate aims to revise at least half the menu every day. He has a second job that helps him do this, as the food buyer of All Good Things, ordering sea creatures, meats and odd lettuces that often end up in his kitchen. Tasting menus ask a lot of customers, but at Le Restaurant, we are rewarded with ingredients that would be hard to sell \u00e0 la carte.\n        \n\n         Mr. Tate works in a contemporary mode, mixing new techniques with very old ones. Vegetables are at least as prominent as meat and fish. Flavor is pulled from within far more often than it is applied to the surface by, say, spices and herbs. Chefs who study enough photographs of this cooking style can imitate the look, but not the taste, which ought to seem as if it comes from a time when flavors were more pure. That requires determination and, maybe, secret knowledge.\n        \n\n         A few weeks ago at Le Restaurant, I ate skate so rich and tender I thought Mr. Tate had found a part of the piscine anatomy that nobody had noticed before. A soft fennel broth and bursting sections of pink grapefruit made fine partners for the skate, but the important alchemy had happened in the pan, when the fish was stewed in olive oil blended with dried, air-cured black olives.\n        \n\n         The sweet, tangy ingredient that made a bowl of long agnolotti with peas and a warm, nearly liquid egg so seductive? House-made cheese, slowly evaporated until it had shrunk to a dense, caramelized brick that was shaved over the pasta.\n        \n\n         In the style made famous by\n         \n          Noma in Copenhagen\n         \n         , some courses are served by the cooks who made them. When the man at the end of the plate is Amadou Ly, the pastry chef and a veteran of\n         \n          Mas\n         \n         and\n         \n          Tocqueville\n         \n         , it\u2019s a sure bet that something delicious is in store. It might be as plain as a candied chestnut and a spoonful of pur\u00e9ed, maple-spiked sweet potatoes with a little brown butter, or a more complex grouping of sweet strawberries, oil of mint, little beads filled with liquefied chocolate and panna cotta infused with lemon verbena. Whatever it is, Mr. Ly\u2019s desserts have a gentle, natural spirit that feels right after Mr. Tate\u2019s savory courses.\n        \n\n         There is a little more bad news. (There always is.) The greeting and the first few minutes of my meals were so rocky that I wasn\u2019t completely sure I was in a restaurant, let alone Le Restaurant.\n        \n\n         One night, I showed up without a reservation. The Web site had said walk-ins were welcome at the counter, but nobody seemed to know what to do with me. An employee in the market asked what I wanted and told me to wait at the top of the stairs. Five minutes went by. Finally, I started down on my own and was met halfway by a host. He seemed surprised and not entirely pleased to see me there.\n        \n\n         \u201cDo you have any seats at the counter?\u201d I asked.\n        \n\n         He gave me the same look that a butler answering the door in a dark old mansion on a hill gives a solitary traveler whose car has broken down.\n        \n\n         \u201cI\u2019m not sure we can accommodate you,\u201d he said. Silently, he turned and descended the stairs. He really should have been carrying a torch, but I followed him anyway.\n        \n\n         Eight stools were lined up at the counter. Seven were empty. Still without speaking, he pointed at one and walked away.\n        \n\n         Somewhere in the night, a wolf howled.\n        \n\n         But there is more good news: once I was settled in, service was unfailingly smooth and professional. I received sound advice on wines, which I appreciated because at Le Restaurant you never know what\u2019s coming next. Menus, handwritten on construction paper, don\u2019t arrive until dinner is over.\n        \n\n         As for the name, Mr. Tate said that he and Kyle Wittels, who owns All Good Things, called the place Le Restaurant \u201cto be somewhat funny.\u201d So if you laugh, at least you\u2019ll be laughing with them.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 227, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/23/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-le-restaurant-in-tribeca.html", "google_mag": 34.099998474121094}, {"review_text": "\n         \u201cUh-oh,\u201d I said under my breath. \u201cIs there a wedding here tonight?\u201d I tried not to sound nervous. I\u2019d talked seven people from three boroughs into traveling to this Cantonese restaurant in Flushing,\n         \n\n\n          Queens\n         \n         , about a mile south of the Flushing stops on the 7 train and the\n         \n\n\n          Long Island Rail Road\n         \n         . But I hadn\u2019t made a reservation.\n        \n\n         The dining room seats slightly fewer people than\n         \n\n\n          Citi Field\n         \n         . The only way we might have trouble getting a table would be if the entire place had been rented out by a couple about to walk hand in hand into marital bliss. And that\u2019s exactly how it looked.\n        \n\n         A classical white arbor stood at the entrance, threaded with silk rosebuds. Lavender swags had been draped from the rafters, and lavender napkins were propped up in the water goblets. Shiny gold curtains hung in the windows, and enormous bows in pink or burgundy flopped from the back of every chair. Servers were buzzing around, immaculately dressed in black suits with red bow ties or striped neckties.\n        \n\n         But no, there was no wedding.\n         \n          Lake Pavilion\n         \n         looks like that every night. It is almost certainly New York\u2019s snazziest banquet-style Cantonese restaurant located in a former diner. Since its opening last year, it has shimmered above the Main Street exit on the Long Island Expressway in a squiggle of blue neon. Off the main dining room, in a string of private rooms marked by varieties of tea spelled out in red LEDs, Chinese families salute birthdays and other milestones with lobsters the size of single-engine planes.\n        \n\n         For the rest of us, finding a Cantonese seafood restaurant as good as Lake Pavilion is a reason to get a group together. By day, dim sum trolleys cruise the dining room like a fleet of dumpling-laden Zambonis. The real interest, though, is in the menu, which goes on for about a dozen pages and does not waste any of them on Chinese-American silliness. This kitchen is as serious as any in the city about Cantonese classics, along with a few more recent notions from\n         \n\n\n          Hong Kong\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         If Dungeness crabs are in season and you do not have a life-threatening allergy, please order them. Get them stir-fried with ginger and scallions, their cracked legs and deep-dish bodies sticky with a sauce that will end up everywhere while you pull the meat from the shells: on your lips and nose and thumbs and probably your earlobes.\n        \n\n         At least as delicious and certainly less gooey is the house special, a casserole of Dungeness crab stacked up on sticky rice that\u2019s been lightly browned while being turned and tossed with roasted peanuts, garlic chives, ham, onion and liberal strafings of fried garlic.\n        \n\n         When the crabs scuttle offstage between seasons, you could bide your time with clams in \u201chot spicy XO sauce.\u201d It looks like soup, the clams submerged in sauce that is not just hot and spicy but also sour, salty and really deeply funky. The sauce gets aromatic depth from onions and bell peppers and a lovely lift from lemon peel, and it\u2019s so intense that the clams taste as if they\u2019ve been stewing in it for hours, yet they\u2019re barely cooked.\n        \n\n         Stringy, yellowing water spinach and \u201ccrispy fried chicken\u201d with garlic, which was neither crisp nor garlicky, were the only cases in which I wasn\u2019t rewarded for testing my luck with the menu.\n        \n\n         Sometimes I pointed at a photo of something I wouldn\u2019t have ordered otherwise. This is how I came to try the bizarrely compelling sea scallops in a black pepper sauce that seemed to belong on a TV dinner steak. When nobody was looking, I kept stealing another scallop from inside the circular green hedge of broccoli, convinced that what I was doing was somehow wrong, and not caring.\n        \n\n         Menu pictures also helped me give mayonnaise prawns another chance. In other restaurants I\u2019d been left cold, not to mention bewildered, by the combination of fried shrimp, candied walnuts and lemony, MSG-laced mayonnaise. Lake Pavilion adds deep-fried pillows of thickened condensed milk. I am not sure why I loved this particular version. I\u2019m not even sure why the dish exists, but I am glad it does.\n        \n\n         Should you want to drive deeper into unusual terrain, I can recommend the goose webs in a casserole with bok choi and Chinese black mushrooms. The thick, floppy webs, which you suck from the goose\u2019s bony toes, had a fascinatingly earthy flavor that reminded me a little of fresh pork belly.\n        \n\n         If that doesn\u2019t fully scratch your itch for adventure, do try the screw clams. Stir-fried with snow peas and yellow chives, they look a bit like squid, crunch slightly between your teeth and have a faint, delicate flavor. Screw clams are not clams. They are often called osmanthus mussels, although they are not mussels, either. They\u2019re organs extracted from sea cucumbers, which are not, of course, vegetables.\n        \n\n         But there is no shame in having something as simple as the excellent stir-fried lamb chops, whose only sauce is a little oil deeply flavored with browned garlic and shallots, or something as old-school as Peking duck. Lake Pavilion does the dish beautifully, shearing off rectangles of skin with a cleaver and tucking them inside yeasty steamed buns dabbed with a little hoisin. The soft buns make a much more satisfying foil for the crisp skin than the pancakes you usually see in New York, and by the time the rest of the duck had been carved, our table was still passing around the platter of little sandwiches, going back for just one more.\n        \n\n         A group of six or eight is about right for the duck, and for Lake Pavilion. But look out for the gentle upsell. Order one lobster or Dungeness crab, and your server may ask if your gang wouldn\u2019t be better off with two. If you want a fish netted in a splash from the tanks by the door, you may at first be shown the species that cost $35 a pound, $75, or more. Ask for cheaper options, like a speckled grouper from\n         \n\n\n          Mexico\n         \n         that emerged dense and moist from the steamer, and cost less than $20 a pound.\n        \n\n         Your server may not push a $110 bowl of shark fin soup, still legal until next summer, but may suggest an off-menu soup served in a hollowed-out winter melon for around $50. Politely decline in favor of the more humble winter melon soup that\u2019s on the menu, its homespun chicken broth full of sweet seafood and ginger slivers. A pot that serves the whole table is $12.95.\n        \n\n         I can happily report that when I ordered a drink, nobody tried to upgrade me to the 2009 Opus One for $350. I got a Tsingtao, no questions asked.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 228, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/25/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-lake-pavilion-in-flushing-queens.html", "google_mag": 25.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n         The name means \u201cthe fifth pine,\u201d a Spanish idiom for the boondocks, which was probably a stretch even seven years ago when El Quinto Pino opened on West 24th Street, across from the canyon wall of\n         \n\n\n          London\n         \n         Terrace. The thumbnail curve of the sardine-can tapas bar is just the way it\u2019s been since the beginning, packed, every seat there and on the opposite wall a few inches away taken almost any time you show up.\n        \n\n         Turn right at the door, though, and you\u2019ll find something new. Last fall, El Quinto Pino\u2019s owners and chefs, Alex Raij and her husband, Eder Montero, took over the lease on the apartment next door and filled it with tables, making their sardine can a real restaurant. \u201cIt won\u2019t make a bid for your entire night: You will snack at El Quinto Pino and almost inevitably eat more somewhere else,\u201d Peter Meehan wrote in a \u201c\n         \n          $25 and Under\u201d column\n         \n         in 2007, its last review in\n         \n\n\n          The New York Times\n         \n         . With a reservation for that side room you won\u2019t need to go anywhere else for dinner. You won\u2019t want to, either, once the food starts zooming out of the kitchen.\n        \n\n         Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero also own Txikito, across Ninth Avenue, which digs into Basque cuisine, and La Vara, in Cobble Hill,\n         \n\n\n          Brooklyn\n         \n         , where the menu is a master\u2019s thesis on Moorish and Jewish imprints upon Spanish cooking. A short \u201cmen\u00fa tur\u00edstico\u201d at El Quinto Pino investigates a different region of the country every few months, which gives regulars a reason to keep coming and gives the kitchen a launching pad for dishes that may hit the permanent roster. Other than that, the two chefs haven\u2019t tied themselves down. Having laid down their Iberian credentials in their other restaurants, they\u2019ve given El Quinto Pino a passport to roam around.\n        \n\n         Among the bar sandwiches tightly wrapped in paper is a visitor from\n         \n\n\n          New Orleans\n         \n         , a po\u2019boy with closely packed, terrifically crunchy fried squid legs at its core. Another is a fortified Cubano, in which the ham and crisp pickle have more oomph than usual, the cheese doesn\u2019t taste processed, for once, and the braised pork is supplemented with a red wallop of blood sausage. The chefs do a takeoff on\n         \n\n\n          Catalonia\n         \n         \u2019s version of the croque monsieur, the bikini, but they aim a double-barreled blast of\n         \n\n\n          Mexico\n         \n         at it, topping the melted cheese with roasted poblanos and huitlacoche, the flamboyantly weird, mushroom-tasting black fungus that grows on corn ears.\n        \n\n         Geographic freedom between pieces of bread was written into El Quinto Pino\u2019s charter from the start, when Ms. Raij brought out (all rise, please) the uni panino. A pressed ficelle filled with creamy sea urchin, melted butter and a lashing of mustard oil, it became one of the city\u2019s essential sandwiches. It still is, even though one night mustard-oil supplies must have run low and the panino wasn\u2019t the same without its throat-catching rumble.\n        \n\n         The rest of the menu is made up of tapas-style plates, and the servers are careful not to overload the small tables, bringing just one or two at a time. The kitchen mostly presents these dishes as tangles that are easily shared, and resists the impulse toward multicomponent platings. With Raij-Montero portions, four people seems to be the breaking point at which you\u2019re not so much eating as nibbling. I enjoyed El Quinto Pino more in a party of three, and best of all with just one accomplice.\n        \n\n         Some of the seafood is so appealing and out of the ordinary that dividing it can test your ability to play well with others. I hated surrendering the last fried lump of sea anemone folded into soft scrambled eggs. Called ortiguillas, they tasted almost like fried oysters, but not quite, and I wanted to get to the bottom of that \u201cnot quite.\u201d My curiosity and my appetite also wanted a few more runs at the Catalan salad xat\u00f3, which mixed chicory and canned bonito with raw salt cod, soaked to pull out the salt and to reveal a flavor of quietly intensified fish. Dressed with both romesco and an uncooked tomato sauce, this salad seemed to get more lively with each bite.\n        \n\n         Tender, apple-blossom-pink gambas al ajillo get a little fresh ginger along with the garlic, an addition that made me want to eat them twice as fast. (Mashed and sliced avocado don\u2019t have the same effect on an oddly inert salpicon of shrimp.)\n        \n\n         Smaller shrimp from\n         \n\n\n          Cadiz\n         \n         , the size of a paper clip and intensely flavorful in their shells, are pressed into a tortillita, a wonderful fritter that looks like a latke cooked under a brick. Fried on their own, these shrimp turn up again to bring a marine undertow to a jiggly poached egg with slivered snow peas.\n        \n\n         The kitchen\u2019s hand is so steady that it\u2019s easy to pass over its occasional bobbles, unless you\u2019re unlucky enough to be served two or three in a row. My disappointments were spread out: dully spiced lamb skewers; underseasoned bits of fried pork whose name, \u201cbag of bacon,\u201d raised undue expectations; seafood fideua, like paella made from noodles, that lacked the oceanic depth I loved when I had the same dish at La Vara.\n        \n\n         And it\u2019s unclear how the xocolata dessert is meant to be served. One night the salt-sprinkled ingot of chocolate ganache was filled with fruity green olive oil that spilled out at the touch of a fork; I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever enjoyed the pairing of the two ingredients more. On another, the oil was cold and congealed like Vaseline. Fortunately I had the excellent crema catalana, roused from its usual custardy slumber by cinnamon and lemon zest, to fall back on.\n        \n\n         Everything I know about dating could be carved onto the head of a pin with a butter knife, but a younger man who lives down the block from El Quinto Pino assures me it\u2019s a great date place. He didn\u2019t mean the bar, with its was-that-your-foot? dimensions, but the new dining room. Separated from the drinkers by a galley kitchen, its 30 seats feel secluded and romantic, but not in an obvious way. The architect Silvia Zofio gave it a quietly domestic, midcentury look, with an earth-toned tapestry covering one wall and a chandelier that suggests the swoosh of a flamenco dancer\u2019s skirt in mid-twirl. It\u2019s a room for talking, and if it\u2019s not exactly the boondocks, it\u2019s easy enough to get lost there for an hour or two.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 229, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/dining/restaurant-review-el-quinto-pino-in-chelsea.html", "google_mag": 18.600000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n         Restaurant critics are supposed to be impartial, but I can\u2019t help feeling some proprietary interest in\n         \n          Tavern on the Green\n         \n         . Not a financial interest, except insofar as a profitable Tavern is good for the city\u2019s budget, which, in a fractions-of-pennies way, is good for me as a grumpy taxpayer. It\u2019s more like a civic interest.\n         \n\n\n          Tavern on the Green\n         \n         belongs to the city and sits inside the most beautiful public park in which I\u2019ve ever rowed, cycled, struck out in softball, misidentified a confusing fall warbler and illegally consumed alcoholic beverages. I\u2019d let the city keep those fractional pennies if that helped Tavern on the Green live up to its setting.\n        \n\n         So you may detect an extra cup or two of enthusiasm in my voice when I say that\n         \n          under its new management\n         \n         , the building is woven into the life of the park more fully than in its last incarnation, a wedding-cake palace as imagined by a 6-year-old princess with a high\n         \n\n\n          fever\n         \n         . And you may hear a few teaspoons of added regret when I say that it\u2019s not a good restaurant yet by any measure.\n        \n\n         The place\n         \n          reopened just two months ago\n         \n         , which may not be enough time to get a 700-seat Winnebago like Tavern up to highway speed. In time, the kitchen may figure out how to get plates on the table while they are still hot. The chef,\n         \n          Katy Sparks\n         \n         , may rethink some of the overworked, underdelivering recipes. The hosts may learn how to read their reservations screen so they don\u2019t tell a customer he\u2019s the first to arrive and ask him to wait while the rest of his party is already in the restaurant\u2019s inner recesses, wondering if he\u2019s gone for a carriage ride. Somebody may tell the servers not to drop the check while people are still eating dessert. The sommeliers may turn down the thermostat so that red wines aren\u2019t the temperature of a kiddie pool.\n        \n\n         Still, compared with its\n         \n          last days before its death\n         \n         from insolvency in 2009 made it the subject of countless dry-eyed eulogies, Tavern on the Green is much, much improved.\n        \n\n         One of its real joys is seeing the exuberant Victorian building, constructed in 1871 as a dormitory for the grass-munching residents of Sheep Meadow, restored down to the last copper drainpipe. The snaggletoothed slate roof has been to the orthodontist. The Parks Department, determined to end the Tavern\u2019s sparkly isolation, tore down the Crystal Room, which used to galumph halfway across the courtyard. The Berlin Wall of giant topiary animals that blocked the view of Sheep Meadow is gone, too. Now if you eat on the terrace, you can see the runners and the pedicab drivers on West Drive, and they can see you.\n        \n\n         The restaurant\u2019s new operators,\n         \n          Jim Caiola and David Salama\n         \n         , have tried to put the tavern back into the Tavern. Ms. Sparks\u2019s plates are substantial, and any leanings toward fanciness are confined to the perimeters of the plate. The menu does not say, \u201cAunt Althea\u2019s 80th birthday\u201d as much as it says: \u201cHi there. If you happen to be going to\n         \n\n\n          Lincoln Center\n         \n         , don\u2019t forget about me!\u201d\n        \n\n         The glittering, un-tavernlike interior encrustations have been scraped off. Next to the entrance is a bar shaped like a racetrack next to a convincing artificial marble fireplace flanked by carved rams\u2019 heads. It\u2019s dark and reassuring, just the kind of sheltered saloon you\u2019d want to end up in after working up a thirst in the park.\n        \n\n         In the main dining room, though, the tavern motif explodes in a whiteout. Everything is bright and off-white: tables, chairs, banquettes, floors. It looks like the indoor-outdoor, all-day, casual-dining option at a family-friendly resort in\n         \n\n\n          Florida\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         The servers have the determined enthusiasm of counselors poached from a summer camp in\n         \n\n\n          Maine\n         \n         and given a crash course in big-city restaurant customs during the bus ride down Interstate 95. One of them thought everything we did and said was \u201cwonderful\u201d: our clever preference for sparkling water over still, our bold decision to look at dessert menus. Another picked up a few crumbs from the leather-topped table with his fingertips, then left the rest. Somebody showed up the instant the plates had been set down to ask brightly, \u201cHow does everything look?\u201d\n        \n\n         I can\u2019t blame her for not asking how it tasted. The answer may have made it hard to stay chipper.\n        \n\n         Prying tiny quail bones away from meat that was griddled until it was as dry as a week-old English muffin wasn\u2019t very wonderful. Neither was the greasy scattering of mushrooms and gummy, flavorless farro strozzapreti baked under a mound of ricotta that had no idea it was supposed to act like a sauce.\n        \n\n         The ceviches aren\u2019t ceviches; they\u2019re rough-sawn carpaccios of seafood covered with garnishes that are either thuggish (harsh pickled onions and acrid, stale fried garlic chips on yellowfin tuna) or useless (avocado lumps on salmon). Then acid is thrown at them. The directive seems to be: terminate with extreme prejudice.\n        \n\n         Is it too late to bring back the sheep?\n        \n\n         No, no. Patience. Maybe the food, which isn\u2019t especially ornate, still needs to come down a notch or two. The pork chop could lose the stringy, sour, half-raw roasted rhubarb. The brisket in a sweetish barbecue sauce, which you\u2019d be happy enough to find at your local brew pub, could do without the comatose potato salad. And the menu would be easier to handle if Ms. Sparks didn\u2019t organize it by heat source. (\u201cI don\u2019t really care what I eat, as long as it was cooked on a plancha!\u201d)\n        \n\n         The most enjoyable dishes tend to be the simplest. The Serrano ham and melted Gruy\u00e8re sandwich was totally likable, which is my clever way of saying it was fried in butter. I couldn\u2019t taste any wood smoke in the hearth-roasted mussels, but they were tender and flavorful in their Spanish-leaning sauce of garlic and chopped almonds. The $56 strip steak was excellent, too, although it probably helped that it was the only main course that arrived hot that night. (It is by far the most expensive of what the menu calls \u201clarge plates.\u201d The others hover around $30, which might squeak by as reasonable for dinner in the park if the cooking didn\u2019t get away from the cooks so often.)\n        \n\n         The prize dessert is also the most modest: the birthday cake. White and soft, with whipped ricotta between the layers and whipped cream on top, it\u2019s exactly what a plain-vanilla American layer cake should be. The other desserts are fine, but they could learn a thing or two from it. The berry shortcake needs a richer, creamier biscuit, and if the fudgelike brownies want to graduate to sundae status, they deserve more than a single scoop of ice cream.\n        \n\n         The best of my four meals at Tavern on the Green was brunch at a shady table in the courtyard, where I watched Sheep Meadow slowly fill up with weekend layabouts. The food wasn\u2019t so wonderful that it would lure crowds, but it wouldn\u2019t keep them away, either. No doubt the restaurant is aiming higher than that, but it wouldn\u2019t be a bad place to begin.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 230, "rating": "Satisfactory", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/25/dining/restaurant-review-tavern-on-the-green.html", "google_mag": 28.0}, {"review_text": "\n         The chef Chip Smith and his wife, Tina Vaughn, moved to New York in 2012 after shutting their restaurant in\n         \n\n\n          North Carolina\n         \n         , but the Simone, which they\n         \n          opened in November\n         \n         , doesn\u2019t feel like a transplanted Southern flower. It is a classic\n         \n\n\n          Manhattan\n         \n         restaurant that seems to have emerged on East 82nd Street fully formed out of a time capsule sealed in the last century.\n        \n\n         When you call the restaurant, which is the only way to reserve one of its 11 tables, Ms. Vaughn will write your name in something called a \u201cbook,\u201d holding an implement known as a \u201cpen.\u201d She applies the same antique tool to the menu, which she writes out in cursive and photocopies each time Mr. Smith changes it.\n        \n\n         The Simone\u2019s search-engine strategy is the opposite of optimized. The restaurant is not on Open Table, Menu Pages,\n         \n\n\n          Twitter\n         \n         or\n         \n\n\n          Facebook\n         \n         , and an Internet search will turn up an unrelated martini bar\u2019s website before\n         \n          the Simone\u2019s\n         \n         . I often think that restaurants with outdoor-concert noise levels, backless benches and no-reservations policies are deliberately trying to scare off older diners. The Simone seems to be attempting something like that in reverse: If you wanted to keep away anyone under 35, this is how you\u2019d do it.\n        \n\n         But as some of those youngsters know, the worn grooves of an old LP can sound richer than the shimmering precision of an MP3. And the Simone has the kind of textured, lived-in, analog warmth that has become rare in Manhattan\u2019s increasingly corporatized, professionalized restaurant scene.\n        \n\n         Though expensive, with main courses fluttering into the low $40s, and formal, with waiters in vests and neckties primping white tablecloths, the Simone isn\u2019t starchy at all. It\u2019s a living, breathing mom-and-pop outfit where Ms. Vaughn will gush with bubbly pride about the Proven\u00e7al bottle she spontaneously offered to work into a flight of ros\u00e9s, while Mr. Smith, no showboat, channels his pride into the cooking. (A third owner, Robert Margolis, keeps a poker-faced watch on the dining room.)\n        \n\n         Like the rest of the Simone, Mr. Smith\u2019s kitchen is a bit of a throwback. The winds of\n         \n          New Nordic\n         \n         and modernist cuisines do not ruffle the surface of his stockpots. He works within French tradition in a manner that was almost the default New York style 15 to 20 years ago. Mr. Smith, who trained under Patrick O\u2019Connell and Jean-Louis Palladin, is not rewriting the rules of French cooking. It\u2019s simply the language he speaks, and he\u2019s fluent enough that he can use it to talk about the ingredients in his part of the world.\n        \n\n         If you were designing a dish to go viral on\n         \n\n\n          Instagram\n         \n         , you\u2019d start by ruling out flounder, which has the must-see quotient of a \u201cMatlock\u201d marathon on TBS. The fish is a favorite of Mr. Smith\u2019s, who served me two flounder dishes that rank among the best seafood I\u2019ve tasted this year. In late winter, he rolled juicy, big-flaked fillets around a mousse of flounder and black truffle flecks; I would have burrowed into it until spring if I hadn\u2019t also wanted to eat the whole thing. The flounder\u2019s cold-weather swaddling disappeared a few weeks ago, and a jaunty new May outfit appeared: a golden sheet of bread crumbs speckled with fresh green herbs on top of the fish, a platform of crushed, minted favas below.\n        \n\n         Mr. Smith\u2019s main courses often pair two takes on a protein, one very good and the other exceptional: a juicy roasted chicken breast with fried croquettes of dark meat, ham and foie gras so hard to ignore that dinner came to a dead stop while we passed them around; a drum of braised lamb shank with a single rib daubed with a Moroccan spice blend that landed with a menacing uppercut of heat; a crisped boneless duck thigh with thin slices of breast that were pink right out to the edges and almost surreally tender.\n        \n\n         One time, Mr. Smith doubled down and lost. The grilled loin and braised thigh of rabbit, both on the dry side, must have been a fluke, because he usually showed the intuition of a chef who knows just how his ingredients want to be handled.\n        \n\n         He has good sense with appetizers, too, and an admirable sense of restraint; he doesn\u2019t turn them into scene stealers that leave the main courses nowhere to go but down. The first king salmon of the Alaskan season were shown off handsomely in a tartare with crisp cucumbers and bright preserved lemons. His goat-cheese souffl\u00e9 was more warm custard than eat-it-now atmospheric condition, but it was still an excellent custard. He carves sweetbreads into long planks, creating more surface area for the crunchy coating of bread crumbs and\n         \n\n\n          Dijon\n         \n         mustard that was more than half the point.\n        \n\n         House-made charcuterie sits at the top of the menu, and it belongs there. Mr. Smith treats the tradition with a rare classicism, as in his recent bacon-wrapped terrine of pork, chicken liver, pistachios, pink plugs of foie gras and Armagnac prunes. I wished that the brioche toast served with it had been a little softer and lighter, but I was happy enough eating the terrine alone. It was like a rousing chorus of\n         \n\n\n          \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d\n         \n         made of meat.\n        \n\n         One night, Ms. Vaughn explained that during some lean times at a previous restaurant when they had to let the pastry chef go, Mr. Smith taught himself to make desserts. He has more of a feel for the last course than many chefs, although there were a few false moves, like a lemon tart that wasn\u2019t puckery enough to withstand a sugary overload of meringue. But other desserts fell right into line, like a tart of Mr. Smith\u2019s own marmalade with a crushed almond topping, and a little tower of\n         \n          Lord Baltimore cake\n         \n         , the yellow layers filled with pecans, dried fruits and coconut that were addled with bourbon, the way Lord\n         \n\n\n          Baltimore\n         \n         intended.\n        \n\n         There is no bar \u201cprogram\u201d at this restaurant, no list of nine-ingredient cocktails with dingbat names like Simone Says. But if your drink request is normal enough, it will materialize on the staircase in the hands of a waiter who presumably got it from some unseen, unheard Jeeves on the second floor.\n        \n\n         The Simone is a personal restaurant, and it has some personal quirks. The sophisticated-lady playlist can push nostalgia a step too far; raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, on the original cast recording, may not be everybody\u2019s favorite thing at dinner. And Ms. Vaughn has a funny habit of sidling up to the table to ask single-word questions: Delicious? Lovely?\n        \n\n         The thing is, there was always a single-word answer: yes.\n        \n\n\n          The Simone\n         \n\n\n         \u2605\u2605\u2605\n        \n\n         151 East 82nd Street (Lexington Avenue), Upper East Side; 212-772-8861;\n         \n          thesimonerestaurant.com\n         \n\n\n\n          ATMOSPHERE\n         \n         An intimate townhouse dining room, old-fashioned but not starchy.\n        \n\n\n          SERVICE\n         \n         Very correct but warm, attentive and personable.\n        \n\n\n          SOUND LEVEL\n         \n         Deeply civilized.\n        \n\n\n          RECOMMENDED\n         \n         House-made terrines; sweetbreads; goat-cheese souffl\u00e9; king salmon tartare; roast duck; Moroccan lamb; flounder with herbed bread crumbs; Lord Baltimore cake; chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me; marmalade-almond tart.\n        \n\n\n          DRINKS AND WINE\n         \n         Classic cocktails and a very strong list of table-friendly wines, largely supplied by the importer Neal Rosenthal.\n        \n\n\n          PRICES\n         \n         Appetizers, $14 to $21; main courses, $34 to $45.\n        \n\n\n          OPEN\n         \n         Monday to Saturday for dinner.\n        \n\n\n          RESERVATIONS\n         \n         Accepted.\n        \n\n\n          WHEELCHAIR ACCESS\n         \n         The dining room and an accessible restroom are two steps down from the sidewalk.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 231, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/dining/restaurant-review-the-simone-on-the-upper-east-side.html", "google_mag": 31.0}, {"review_text": "\n         Main courses are never as good as the starters, people like to say. I\u2019ve always argued that a good chef won\u2019t let that happen, but I have to admit that it does seem true for a lot of Italian restaurants, at least in\n         \n\n\n          New York City\n         \n         . There are exceptions, of course, but as a general rule, it\u2019s all downhill after the spaghetti.\n        \n\n         One of several reasons to like\n         \n          Bar Primi\n         \n         ,\n         \n          Andrew Carmellini\n         \n         \u2019s new restaurant at East Second Street and the Bowery, is that there is almost nothing on the menu but appetizers and pasta. You can eat all the things you go to Italian places for without ordering a $35 grilled salmon simply to prove that you know fusilli is not considered a main course in\n         \n\n\n          Milan\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         Mr. Carmellini and his partners (Josh Pickard, Luke Ostrom and Sal Lamboglia) have not exactly discovered life on Mars with this concept. After all, this is the founding principle of cheap Italian restaurants across the country. It\u2019s unusual, though, to see it endorsed by a chef who knows better. Pasta is the whole point of\n         \n          Porsena\n         \n         , which the chef Sara Jenkins calls her \u201cpasta-centric restaurant,\u201d as you know if you\u2019ve had the firm, chewy rings of anneloni tossed with fiery lamb sausage and bitter greens. But then her menu proceeds to a full roster of secondi.\n        \n\n         To be fair, Mr. Lamboglia, a longtime Carmellini cook who leads the kitchen at Bar Primi, does offer one main course a night on a weekly rotation. (On Wednesday, it\u2019s the Italian sausage served at Mr. Carmellini\u2019s\n         \n          Sausage Boss kiosks in Madison Square Garden\n         \n         .) Each time I was there, the servers also pushed a special, a grilled branzino \u201cmuffaletta,\u201d which they said meant the fish comes with chopped green olives, like the sandwich. I ordered it once. It was fine. I preferred the pasta.\n        \n\n         The menu divides them into \u201ctraditional\u201d and \u201cseasonal.\u201d We would be here for hours if I tried to figure out what is seasonal about orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe, a widely known classic from Southern Italy, or which tradition gave us spaghetti with a sauce inspired by clams casino. The important thing to notice is that there are 12 choices in all, and one of them is almost certain to be exactly what you feel like eating.\n        \n\n         For me, on almost any given night, that would be the linguine with golden bread crumbs and garlic that\u2019s been slapped around in hot olive oil for a minute or so. It may be because the kitchen is using this season\u2019s garlic, but the sliced cloves (four of them, the menu says) tasted as juicy and fresh as corn and, in their oniony way, almost as sweet. For this, I paid $14 and counted myself lucky. Spaghetti pomodoro, also $14, is just as uncomplicated and just as right, with green basil clinging to plum tomatoes cooked to the halfway point between fruit and sauce.\n        \n\n         Mr. Lamboglia makes those dishes with dried imported noodles. Most of the other pasta is fresh and very good. Its finest use may be the fiore di carciofi, a long, fat spiral filled with creamy artichoke and mascarpone. The sauce (a hot ladleful of fried bacon, garlic, chopped parsley and white wine) works mysteriously well with this mutant, vaguely flower-shaped cannelloni.\n        \n\n         Bar Primi applies its sauces more liberally than a place in\n         \n\n\n          Parma\n         \n         might. Italian verisimilitude is not the goal. Mr. Carmellini and Mr. Lamboglia, who was raised in Bensonhurst,\n         \n\n\n          Brooklyn\n         \n         , by a father who cooked for years in restaurants on and off Mulberry Street, have given the menu a red-sauce generosity, even when the sauces aren\u2019t red.\n        \n\n         Sal\u2019s Antipasti Salad is basically an antipasto sampler of the kind usually seen on a checkered tablecloth \u2014 sliced salami and provolone, raw celery and radishes \u2014 thrown into a tossed salad with a small blizzard of Parmigiano-Reggiano. It\u2019s impossible to dislike. Shrimp and octopus with boiled potatoes and pickled cherry peppers make a cold seafood salad that few checkered-tablecloth joints could rival. There are even meatballs filled with melted fontina in a rough tomato sauce. You want them to taste handmade, honest and delicious. They do.\n        \n\n         Grilled broccolini dressed with stewed onions and Aleppo pepper sits on a shiny, smooth brick-colored emulsion. It looks creamy and soothing. It is fierce, fiery and garlic-drenched, a fantastic trick played by the kitchen.\n        \n\n         The menu has minor dips but no major sinkholes. That disassembled clams casino over spaghetti could do with more clams and less cleverness. The day I had orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe, the divots of dough weren\u2019t as shiny with pork fat and olive oil as they might have been.\n        \n\n         The idea for Bar Primi came to Mr. Carmellini years ago, before he left\n         \n          A Voce\n         \n         and built his fief of a half-dozen restaurants in New York and one in\n         \n\n\n          Miami\n         \n         . The chance to do it finally came along when\n         \n          Peels\n         \n         quietly shuffled out of business this year. Taavo Somer, an owner of that restaurant, was hired to rework his Peels design, mixing domestic idioms like white paneling and mullioned windows at tree-branch height with rustic Italian motifs, like wine shelves of unfinished wood. The result is an inviting, civilized spot, one that reaches back over the Bowery\u2019s skid-row period to the brief age when the East Village was on\n         \n\n\n          Edith Wharton\n         \n         \u2019s map of New York society.\n        \n\n         Within Mr. Carmellini\u2019s fleet, Bar Primi is more a neighborhood hangout in the spirit of\n         \n          the Dutch\n         \n         than a big, booming circus like\n         \n          Locanda Verde\n         \n         or\n         \n          Lafayette\n         \n         . Like all of those places, and unlike the stereotypical linguine slinger, Bar Primi has a deeply affordable wine list you could happily get lost in. Off topic for a linguine slinger but very much on topic for a hangout, there is at all hours a great hot roast beef sandwich, shaved thin and kicked into action with spicy red pepper sauce. So sure of itself it is known simply as the Sandwich, it deserves to join the venerable epitomes of the genre found at Brennan & Carr and Roll-n-Roaster in Brooklyn.\n        \n\n         New Yorkers who have watched Mr. Carmellini\u2019s game throughout his career may complain that he now rarely drives to the basket for the spectacular dunks he used to throw down when he was coached by\n         \n\n\n          Daniel Boulud\n         \n         . I made that complaint myself about the unimaginative, stubbornly un-French cooking at Lafayette when it opened. But a well-timed layup like Bar Primi can win games, too.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 232, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/03/dining/restaurant-review-bar-primi-in-the-east-village.html", "google_mag": 27.399999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n         A new restaurant from the chefs Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone and their partner Jeff Zalaznick tiptoed onto the Lower East Side in September, demurely announcing its name with two eight-foot-high neon signs in peep-show pink. DIRTY, says one. FRENCH, reads the other.\n        \n\n         Diners who have reservations for\n         \n          Dirty French\n         \n         , secured with a credit card and a gentle warning of a modest $50-a-person cancellation fee, will find a dining room inside the Ludlow hotel that is decorated with a few shoestring-budget items, like a wall-length antique carnival mirror shipped from\n         \n\n\n          France\n         \n         . A few weeks ago, the partners had the artist Rashid Johnson, a frequent guest, throw oozing slicks of wax blended with West African black soap against the mirror\u2019s glass. (Around the same time, one of Mr. Johnson\u2019s wax-and-soap works sold at auction for just under $200,000.) Across from the mirror, over the bar, is a wide French flag that\n         \n\n\n          Julian Schnabel\n         \n         splotched with ink. Down on the tiled floor, in another humble little gesture, servers lope around in squeaky-fresh limited edition Air Jordans from the \u201980s, some of which probably cost more than I paid for my first car.\n        \n\n         Ever since\n         \n          Carbone\n         \n         and its neighbor, ZZ\u2019s Clam Bar, came along,\n         \n          swagger and money\n         \n         have been to Torrisi-Carbone-Zalaznick establishments what blinking lights and sitars are to Sixth Street\u2019s Curry Row. If the word for flaunting cash and art-world connections like this doesn\u2019t occur to you immediately, look at the strutting crowd of ceramic roosters that Mr. Zalaznick spray-painted in screaming pink: Dirty French is one cocky restaurant.\n        \n\n         It can also be an immensely enjoyable one. That sounds contradictory, but the same self-confidence that can get on your nerves also allows this crew to mess around with French cuisine with a hugely energizing lack of respect. In unnatural crossbreeding experiments, they force bistro cooking to mate with haute cuisine. To make dinner less stuffy and formal, they bring back stuffy formalities like cut-glass wine carafes and frilly oyster plates. They smudge the pages of Escoffier with strange foreign spices. It may sound like run-of-the-mill fusion, but it is a top-to-bottom remix, and nearly every weird mongrel idea leads in the direction of more flavor or more fun.\n        \n\n         Chefs more deferential to custom may not have ditched the hallowed basket of levain or baguette \u00e0 l\u2019ancienne in favor of a flatbread inspired by the mahjeb Mr. Torrisi ate, one loaf after another, in a North African neighborhood of\n         \n\n\n          Paris\n         \n         . It\u2019s no innovation, this bread, just pita dough griddled in plenty of olive oil, buried under Proven\u00e7al herbs and sent out with a snowbank of fromage blanc, but people tore it up with greedy, greasy fingers at every table, mine included.\n        \n\n         Not that the chefs hide their training. (Mr. Torrisi worked for years under\n         \n\n\n          Daniel Boulud\n         \n         and takes the lead in this kitchen.) The mille-feuille is a technical showstopper, an accordion of ribbon-thin king trumpet mushroom stems folded over and over. It looks like pastry but pulls apart like buttered noodles, and when you drag them through a pool of green curry, the scene shifts to\n         \n\n\n          Thailand\n         \n         . It\u2019s a disorienting dish, and makes your head spin in a wonderful way.\n        \n\n         The restaurant creates a parallel world where French pastry turns into Thai curry; it\u2019s as if the chefs have imagined an alternative history in which the leading kitchens of France turned left instead of right several decades ago. What if nouvelle cuisine had embraced maximalism instead of minimalism, full-frontal abandon instead of lean precision? And what if, instead of teaching Americans to make puff pastry, the country\u2019s chefs had taken cooking lessons from the rest of the French-speaking world?\n        \n\n         For one thing, they might have come up with Dirty French\u2019s glorious lamb carpaccio. Brushed with a slow-burning raz al hanout oil, sprinkled with tart sumac powder and fresh herbs, dotted with sheep\u2019s milk yogurt and preserved lemon and wheels of roasted eggplant, the slices of lamb loin are saddled with as much flavor as they can reasonably be asked to carry.\n        \n\n         Or, though this probably needed a push from the roast-chicken gold rush started at\n         \n          the NoMad\n         \n         , they might have hit upon Dirty French\u2019s $72 poultry feast. First to arrive is the sneakily rich (translation: you can\u2019t see the foie gras) white meat in mustard-herb sauce. Then the bird\u2019s hindquarters show up on a cutting board. They\u2019ve been soaked in a Vietnamese marinade of soy, fish sauce and lemon grass, slowly cooked in melted chicken fat (oh yes they have), then grilled and freshened up with lime zest. The chicken comes with crepes, irrelevantly; just pick up a drumstick and get to work on that burnished skin.\n        \n\n         The chefs have an instinct for the right kind of too much, but some dishes trip into the wrong kind. A deeply aromatic and fairly traditional bouillabaisse was thick with octopus, mussels, monkfish and one small, whole, wonderful red mullet. Cuttlefish ink took the broth to the outer edge of intensity, but the medicinal taste of fresh marjoram in some spoonfuls went beyond it. And while duck heart kebabs unloaded at the table added brawn to a fris\u00e9e and lardons salad, the blast of mustard in the dressing was an excessive use of force.\n        \n\n         A programmatic rollout of the formula \u2014 Something Clearly French Under Heaps of Post-Colonial Exotica \u2014 doesn\u2019t guarantee a sprinkling of magical pixie dust on every plate. Baked clams seemed perplexed by their thick jackets of almonds and Ethiopian spices, and so was I. A beautifully cooked trout meuni\u00e8re was speckled with sesame seeds and herbs, a mix that came across as an oddly neutered za\u2019atar.\n        \n\n         Still, you can eat extraordinarily well by calling your shots and rolling with the loose, genial decadence of the place. The mood is set when a server comes over and says, in as laid-back a tone as anyone can manage while lugging an enormous 19th-century sterling silver punch bowl filled with ice, \u201cI wanted to let you have a look at tonight\u2019s oysters.\u201d Oysters: Why not? It continues when Lela\u00f1ea Fulton, who assembled a wine list that is all French, and fun for all kinds of budgets, shows up dressed like one of Charlie\u2019s Angels working undercover as a sommelier. Old Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape? Sure.\n        \n\n         It goes on through dessert, under the assured hand of the pastry chef Heather Bertinetti, who gracefully threads her way through the French-exotic conceit with a delicately architectural coconut-passionfruit\n         \n\n\n          Napoleon\n         \n         and a very short but very good pineapple tarte Tatin, rum-raisin ice cream on top.\n        \n\n         Mr. Torrisi, Mr. Carbone and Mr. Zalaznick, cautious and retiring as ever, plan to open three original restaurants next year while continuing to build new Parm locations. The question is whether this will leave them the energy to keep refining their mongrel bistro on Ludlow Street while rolling out its breakfast and lunch menus in the coming months. Dirty French needs time to grow into its ideas, and maybe to grow out of a few of them.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 235, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/dining/restaurant-review-dirty-french-on-the-lower-east-side.html", "google_mag": 25.200000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n         Before telling you how impressed I am by the new Mu Ramen in Long Island City,\n         \n\n\n          Queens\n         \n         , I want to clear up my role in the demise of the first Mu Ramen.\n        \n\n         Last March, I wrote\n         \n          an article\n         \n         about New York\u2019s quickly diversifying ramen landscape. One place I discussed was Mu Ramen, which had found a temporary home operating after-hours inside a bagel shop. Almost as an afterthought, I made a list of the 10 ramen bowls\n         \n          I had enjoyed the most\n         \n         during my reporting, putting Mu\u2019s suave and creamy tonkotsu at the top.\n        \n\n         The article and the list appeared online on a Tuesday afternoon. On Wednesday morning, Mu Ramen canceled all future appearances, saying it had been deluged with requests for reservations. Immediately, I was blamed in some quarters for killing the pop-up. One person on\n         \n\n\n          Twitter\n         \n         , accusing me of stoking a demand that the place could not handle, went so far as to call me a \u201cherb.\u201d\n        \n\n         If I knew how to make money, I wouldn\u2019t work for a newspaper. Still, I had a sense that this is not how capitalism works. Last week, Joshua Smookler, Mu Ramen\u2019s chef and its owner, told me \u201cthe real reason\u201d he had decamped from the bagel shop.\n        \n\n         \u201cI was scared of the government finding out what we were doing,\u201d he said, even though he believed it was legal, \u201cand was afraid that would have an effect on our doing a brick-and-mortar.\u201d\n        \n\n         He had just signed a lease on the current site, and he and his wife, Heidy He, wanted to concentrate on getting it ready.\n        \n\n         Others can judge whether that makes me a card-carrying herb. For my part, I\u2019m just happy to report that the new, bagel-free Mu Ramen is a great place to smooth over any hard feelings caused by its nine-month absence.\n        \n\n         Of all the restaurants in the city where you are expected to make loud slurping noises while you eat, Mu may be the most civilized. The 22 seats half-fill a space that could easily hold more, and if you have to wait for one of them (after an experiment with reservations, the place is now first come first served, except for the tasting menus that will begin later this month), the deep built-in benches by the front door are a pleasant change from, say, the steps in front of\n         \n          Totto Ramen\n         \n         in Hell\u2019s Kitchen. Six of the seats face a counter. The rest surround three slabs of reclaimed wood. These communal tables touch but don\u2019t quite line up, creating little pockets of semi-intimacy, along with a sense of roominess. Running along the ceiling are thin wood slats bent into waves. They look like noodles swimming out of the kitchen.\n        \n\n         Before you face down the ramen, the appetizers may call your name; they definitely called mine. One of the best things to eat at Mu comes not from the streets of\n         \n\n\n          Tokyo\n         \n         , where Mr. Smookler has never been, but from his apartment, where he and his wife steam mussels when friends come for dinner. At the restaurant, he cooks clams instead, spooning a hypnotically aromatic saffron aioli over them. Then the dish takes a leap that makes no sense until you try it: You pick up a clam and scoop up some Vietnamese nuoc cham with the shell. Why the flowery musk of saffron reacts so well to lime and fish sauce I cannot say. Every clam was a fresh surprise and a fresh mystery.\n        \n\n         He also makes a tender, airy corn pancake, squirts some foie-gras-fortified maple syrup over it, then covers it with smoked trout. It\u2019s wonderful, especially if you like the sneaky feeling of eating breakfast at night. The only Japanese thing about it, other than the flyingfish roe dotting the trout, is the name. Mr. Smookler calls it an \u201cokonomiyaki\u201d (quotation marks his).\n        \n\n         For a fuller immersion in Japanese flavors, try the chirashi variant called U&I, named for the uni and ikura that are mounded with spicy raw tuna over sushi rice. U&I is far from groundbreaking, which does not at all detract from its pleasure. But the two times I tried the fried chicken wings stuffed with foie gras and brioche, they did not stop traffic, which they are clearly meant to do. The crust and meat were superb, but the stuffing was dull, and the quince paste that might have brought it into relief was bunched up at one end of the wing.\n        \n\n         Mr. Smookler trained in the meticulous rigor of\n         \n          Per Se\n         \n         \u2019s kitchen, and his gift, those wings notwithstanding, is his Keller-like drive to find a better way. This usually means a harder and more costly way. When his supply of pork for tonkotsu broth suddenly dried up last year, he went to the Midwest and persuaded nearly 40 farmers who raise Berkshire hogs to start a cooperative. Then he arranged for a small slaughterhouse to butcher the four cuts of pork he wanted and ship them to Long Island City, where he would cook 120 pounds of bones at a raging boil for most of a day.\n        \n\n         This is a long way to go for a bowl of soup. (Metaphorically speaking, it is also a long journey for Mr. Smookler, who was born in\n         \n\n\n          South Korea\n         \n         and raised in New York as an Orthodox Jew.) If $15 seems a fair price for those ingredients, the conviction only grows once you start eating.\n        \n\n         Like all of Mu Ramen\u2019s broths, the tonkotsu has a flavor both deep and long, with extraordinary balance and a rounded profile that has no jarring, gamy edges. Without being greasy, it\u2019s gorgeously full-bodied and almost chewy; as you wind the noodles into your mouth, the droplets that cling to them feel like heavy cream. The flavor is very good, but it\u2019s the texture that can rock you back on your three-legged stool.\n        \n\n         Mr. Smookler pulls a similar consistency out of boiled beef bones, veal bones and oxtails for the soup he calls Mu Ramen. He drew the inspiration for the stock from the Korean dish seolleongtang. For the toppings, he went to the other side of his upbringing. He corns beef brisket, brines cucumber ribbons and shaves raw cabbage into threads that cook when they hit the bowl. The half-sour pickles are juicy and refreshing, and at the same time they transport you to your favorite delicatessen.\n        \n\n         More meetings with more farmers produced the chicken skin, feet and giblets that go into the shoyu ramen that just strutted onto the menu. The broth is another full-bodied knockout, and the chicken flavor is pure and intense.\n        \n\n         The weightiest, richest possible broth is not necessarily the ramen ideal.\n         \n          Ramen Lab\n         \n         , on Kenmare Street in\n         \n\n\n          Manhattan\n         \n         , makes a more traditional shoyu with a chicken broth that is very pure but more restrained than Mr. Smooker\u2019s, so it blends with the soy more willingly. Mr. Smookler\u2019s ramen is so compelling in part because it\u2019s an exception. My praise for it should not be taken as a signal to other chefs to try to make soups as robustly silky as his.\n        \n\n         Speaking of praise, if I had it all to do over again, would I still tell the world how much I admire Mu Ramen? Do I feel the same way now?\n        \n\n         Absolutely.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 237, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/06/dining/restaurant-review-mu-ramen-in-long-island-city-queens.html", "google_mag": 31.600000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n         It can\u2019t have been much fun for Jonathan Wu, the chef and an owner of\n         \n          Fung Tu\n         \n         , when\n         \n          Mission Chinese Food\n         \n         set up shop virtually around the corner in December. For his first year in business down in the headwaters of Orchard Street, just off East Broadway\u2019s warren of Fujianese places, Mr. Wu was the only Asian-American chef plundering Chinese traditions to weave a modern cuisine of his own imagining. Then\n         \n          Danny Bowien\n         \n         showed up a couple of blocks away with his kung pao pastrami and his Mylar rainbow wall and his \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d hallway, and fanboys and fangirls turned cartwheels on the sidewalks.\n        \n\n         Sure, in theory, the more the merrier, a rising tide lifts all boats, and so on, but Fung Tu was now in the shadow of the only hipster-Chinese restaurant that anybody wanted to talk about. As a friend who likes both places put it, there must be moments when Mr. Wu feels like\n         \n          Donovan in \u201cDon\u2019t Look Back.\u201d\n         \n\n\n         Fung Tu didn\u2019t help its own cause by getting off to a tentative start in 2013. A dinner about a month in held as many timid nonstarters (sunchokes and mushrooms uneventfully inhabiting a steamed bun) as eye-opening treats (the egg roll of pork belly and juicy olives stuffed into a delicately fried garlic-chive crepe). Some early reviews fell between nonplused and underwhelmed. Ligaya Mishan, in\n         \n          a Hungry City column\n         \n         , was more taken with the food than other critics were, but she thought some flavors never quite showed up.\n        \n\n         The sound of heads being scratched must have carried to the kitchen, because Mr. Wu has adjusted. Over three meals since the late winter, I rarely had any doubt what he was getting at. Mr. Wu is a two-year veteran of\n         \n          Per Se\n         \n         , and his cooking has always relied on nuance. It still does, but now the accents have been filled in. When something is supposed to be salty or spicy, it is. When salt and spice aren\u2019t on the dance card, farmers\u2019 market vegetables and other main ingredients step up. Dishes that were great from the start, like the duck-stuffed Medjool dates that drink up smoke until they taste like date bacon, are at least as good now. Some may be better. And many of the new dishes are a reason for anybody who wrote off Fung Tu after the early days to put a return visit at the top of the calendar.\n        \n\n         See, for instance, the\n         \n\n\n          China\n         \n         -quiles, which was devised for brunch but stays in its pajamas until dinner. The template is ma po tofu, but the bean curd has been replaced by a smoky egg custard so smooth and silky it almost parts itself when your spoon gets close. Over that goes a Sichuan pork sauce that makes your mouth hum and burn, studded with transparently thin yucca chips for crunch. On the opening menu, a similar but more fainthearted pork sauce was ladled over a white pile of doughy, bland dumpling knots. The sauce on the China-quiles is so much more delicious that you couldn\u2019t call it an evolution; it\u2019s more like an intervention.\n        \n\n         The Sichuan two-step occurs again in a vinaigrette that dresses cured Spanish mackerel, carved into elegant slices that almost look like small anchovies. With tart little buttons of pickled hon shimeji mushrooms, Mr. Wu shows that he can pluck the hot, sour and salty notes as cleanly and precisely as\n         \n\n\n          Jean-Georges Vongerichten\n         \n         . He can also bend classic European spring flavors in his direction, tossing asparagus, morels and peas with ricotta gnocchi that receive a whiff of Gorgonzola from doufu ru, fermented tofu.\n        \n\n         Fried soft-shell clams appeared on the menu when spring got into gear. Their breading was a shade too thick, but Mr. Wu surrounded them with flavors that could make a clam rake taste good. First, he dusted them with dehydrated tomatoes, dried ginger and ground chiles, a blend that is a staple of Indian curries but becomes newly exciting in powdered form. Fermented black beans echoed the blend\u2019s sour-salty theme. Fried clams want tartar sauce;\u00a0Fung Tu\u2019s is seasoned with star anise, charred ginger and other aromatics from a bowl of pho.\n        \n\n         The snack menu at Fung Tu does more than pad the check; it lets Mr. Wu come out and play. There are chips and dip, in the form of shrimp chips, shiny with hot oil, and a soft, rich, angry-red \u2019nduja. A sweet throat-burning mustard sauce was a little too intense for simple chicken wings, but the pairing of gently briny smoked mussels with scallion oil was so fresh and lively that I would like to take back what I said about smoked mussels at my parents\u2019 cocktail parties. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re in the clear yet, smoked oysters.\n        \n\n         Many wines would butt heads with such delicate, oblique cooking. Sommeliers overprescribe Gew\u00fcrtztraminer for Chinese food, while laypeople tend to self-medicate with Tsingtao. Jason Wagner, Fung Tu\u2019s drinks overlord and general manager, has better ideas. His very affordable list is packed with cryptic names like mondeuse and macabeu, which he will gladly decode. An enthusiastic partisan of sherry, he is worth listening to when he suggests a Gran Barquero amontillado that tastes like toasted hazelnuts dipped in caramel for the thin-cut fried pork chops with fermented mustard greens, a Chinatown classic here given a tangy, syrupy sherry-maple soy glaze.\n        \n\n         The service in the beginning was a little tightly wound for a restaurant that sat between Success Hosiery and Yat Sing Trading Inc. Now the staff has relaxed into the setting, where handsome wood booths and straight-backed banquettes are\u00a0illuminated by bare chrome-dipped bulbs caged in polyhedral glass webs made by Mr. Wu\u2019s wife, the jewelry designer\n         \n          Jane D\u2019Arensbourg\n         \n         . The bar up front provides an unhectic cove where you can decompress with cocktails that locate the middle ground between tradition and invention.\n        \n\n         Not usually the grandest of finales in Chinese restaurants, desserts, under Mr. Wu and his chef de cuisine, John Matthew Wells, are given a little more thought at Fung Tu, though they still seem like stepchildren to the rest of the menu. There are fried buns with fruit; a white chocolate mousse, not too sweet, with smooth, firm rhubarb slices; and peanut butter-chocolate truffles rolled in sesame seeds.\n        \n\n         When I first tasted one of those truffles, in 2013, it was chalk-dry and bitter, and went back to its plate after one small nibble. Like many things about Fung Tu, it turned out to be worth a second look.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 238, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/dining/restaurant-review-fung-tu-on-the-lower-east-side.html", "google_mag": 24.0}, {"review_text": "\n         The calendar said January when\n         \n          Santina\n         \n         opened early this year. The temperature outside hovered just above freezing. That said January, too.\n        \n\n         But almost nothing inside did.\n         \n\n\n          Santina\n         \n         \u2019s new glass-box building sits under the High Line like an unwisely located greenhouse, but oranges grew on the branches of a little tree, potted palms sat in the corners, heliconia and other tropical flowers gushed from glazed urns above the bar. Servers wore jelly-bean-colored polo shirts and slim-waisted chinos, like\n         \n\n\n          Dean Martin\n         \n         reaching for his 9-iron at Pebble Beach.\n        \n\n         People were sharing fritto misto, as crisp and fresh as any in town, and pulling apart multicolored bouquets of crunchy raw vegetables radiating from bowls of chipped ice. They were sipping cocktails through straws stuck into pineapple mugs, as if on a Waikiki honeymoon. Even when the front doors opened, the building is so painstakingly designed by the architect\n         \n\n\n          Renzo Piano\n         \n         (with the firm Beyer Blinder Belle) that its vestibule kept the cold winds of the meatpacking district from invading the dining room.\n        \n\n         Inside Santina, it was summer in January. It\u2019s summer there now, and unless the landlord turns off the heat, it will still be summer when Christmas gets here.\n        \n\n         Almost all the food at Santina pulses with the bright, refreshing flavors we crave in hot weather and, it turns out, in other months, too: jolts of chiles, sparks of citrus. Fresh herbs are tossed around frequently and enthusiastically. Chives, mint and basil turn a wonderfully gentle tomato-free minestrone garden-green; Thai basil leaves are flattened over the mint-and-parsley salsa verde applied to a juicy, sweet grilled porgy; tortellini sorrentina (delicate eggy pasta sheets stuffed with soft sheep\u2019s milk ricotta) are surrounded by raw marinara sauce and some olive oil mixed liberally with, what else, fresh herbs. Individually, none of Santina\u2019s tricks are really new, but the kitchen throws them all together in ways that are fun, energizing and mood-altering.\n        \n\n         Santina comes to us from Mario Carbone, Rich Torrisi and Jeff Zalaznick,\n         \n          busy restaurateurs\n         \n         who somehow find the time to endow each place they open with the thematic complexity of a Paul Thomas Anderson movie. The food, they have said, is coastal Italian, in part because the corner of\n         \n\n\n          Washington\n         \n         and Gansevoort Streets where the restaurant sits\n         \n          used to be shoreline\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         The three restaurateurs take their concepts further than anybody else in New York, though. They have elaborated the coastal-seafood notion to the point of seeing Santina as a seafood restaurant in an Italian beach town somewhere, maybe along the Italian Riviera during the 1950s or \u201960s. This gets them to the palm trees and the servers\u2019 resort-wear costumes. It also inspires a hilarious playlist, mixing sambas and cha-chas (Remember how the same\n         \n          Perez Prado tune\n         \n         pursued Marcello Mastroianni in \u201cLa Dolce Vita\u201d wherever he went, even at the seaside village by Fiumicino?) and period Italian pop tunes from singers including Fred Buscaglione, the\n         \n          gangster impersonator\n         \n         who always seemed to get gunned down by a vengeful woman in the last verse.\n        \n\n         Mr. Carbone, who leads the kitchen with Dan Haar, the chef de cuisine, has said that the restaurant is named after his Sicilian grandmother. But Liguria plays a bigger role in the kitchen, providing pistou and the chickpea pancake, called a cecina, crisp on top with a soft white underbelly, ready to be spread with crushed, exuberantly seasoned avocados or an excellent salad of tiny shrimp or cold cubes of raw tuna humming with herbs and Calabrian chiles.\n        \n\n         The Carbone-Torrisi-Zalaznick team doesn\u2019t let its themes get in the way of a fun idea, though. The bartenders stock plenty of Italian aperitifs for their excellent run of cocktails, but they also let their grass skirts sway to the ukulele strains of tiki drinks in concoctions like the pineapple-and-banana-flavored Manganelli punch. While Italian seafood dominates the main courses, the grilled chicken comes in a sensational robust guajillo sauce that is as Ligurian as\n         \n\n\n          Rand Paul\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         These are not the kinds of two-ingredient recipes that you would throw together when it\u2019s too hot to cook. It\u2019s fairly complex stuff, and occasionally a heavy hand gets the better of the kitchen and the summer sun turns oppressive. Blue crab meat with spaghetti became mired in an oily glop of tomato sauce, and excess pork fat dragged down a bowl of warm rice salad tossed with guanciale and heaps of black pepper. Sea bass Agrigento, though cooked just right and buoyed by herbs and orange sections, sank under suffocating amounts of red peppers.\n        \n\n         Josh Ber\u2019s desserts, on the other hand, almost seem underthought. Filling three cannoli with cream in the Italian-flag colors \u2014 green pistachio, white coconut and red maraschino cherry \u2014 is a cute idea, but the pastry tubes are limp. So is the tart shell that\u2019s filled with a pond of dark, rich pudding to make a chocolate diplomatico; it\u2019s thin without being crisp. All the desserts are gluten-free, a worthwhile goal, but the substitutions entail more sacrifice than they probably should. The meringue puff topped with lime custard is very good, but it could use company.\n        \n\n         By the end of the meal, though, if the noise ricocheting off the glass walls hasn\u2019t gotten to you, you\u2019re likely to be in a frame of mind that isn\u2019t much bothered by limp pastry. Most of the food, particularly toward the top of the menu, is charming and playful in a way that\u2019s hard to fight. The rice-salad concept applied to shrimp zingara is a lively, spicy hit. Beyond seafood, Santina has a very winning way with vegetables. Even when it stoops to using seasonal produce, it gives them a warm-weather brightness. Butternut squash discs, lightly scorched to char and soften their edges, get a topping of cracked pink peppercorns, pumpkinseeds and honey agrodolce that almost turns them into candy. Even the kale and sunchoke salad, with pomegranate capsules strewn around like buckshot, tastes cheerful.\n        \n\n         Santina\u2019s eternal sunshine is a kind of rebuke to dogmatic seasonality. It feels like an answer from Mr. Carbone, Mr. Torrisi and Mr. Zalaznick to the wintry Scandinavian visions that are now in fashion; to the chefs whose bleak, gnarled plates of sunchokes look like scenery left over from one of\n         \n\n\n          Ingmar Bergman\n         \n         \u2019s gloomier excursions. If the people at Santina ever meet\n         \n          Death on the beach\n         \n         , they\u2019re ready to kick sand on his blanket and challenge him to a game of volleyball.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 239, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/22/dining/restaurant-review-santina-in-the-meatpacking-district.html", "google_mag": 23.5}, {"review_text": "\n            Greeting us when we walked into\n            \n             Chaiwali\n            \n            , the Indian restaurant she runs on the first two floors of her brownstone in Harlem, Anita Trehan had two tables to offer. All the others were taken. It was a busy Friday night.\n           \n\n            \u201cI have this long wood table here,\u201d she said. \u201cOr,\u201d she continued, extending one arm toward the foot of the staircase leading to a second-story dining room, \u201cI have this beautiful little marble table right there.\u201d She sounded as if it were a prize she had been saving for the first people she thought would appreciate it.\n           \n\n            Now, this table sits in a tight corner. Its edges are deeply scalloped, so once our samosas and smoked eggplant arrived, it became clear that the marble surface was even smaller than it looked. But by that point, it didn\u2019t matter. The owner, who is also the\n            \n             chef, the decorator and the occupant of the house\u2019s upper stories\n            \n            , had proudly seated us at a piece of furniture she had bought and placed there because she liked the way it looked. What were we going to do but settle in and see what else she wanted to share with us?\n           \n\n            This must be one reason large, diverse crowds have descended on Chaiwali since it opened last year despite its fairly low profile outside the neighborhood. So many restaurants that draw more publicity seem interchangeable: Nobody would notice if they traded menu items, light fixtures or any employees short of the chef. Chaiwali does not always have their caliber of professionalism; servers are genial but may forget dishes, and when it\u2019s time to clear the table, they may disappear into the vapor. But it does have its own way of looking at the world.\n           \n\n            Ms. Trehan seems to have built the restaurant on the belief that the things she likes will make the rest of us happy, too. You see this in eccentric bits of decoration, like the stuffed peacock that perches on the upstairs bar. The whole second floor is a bit of a peacock; there\u2019s also a taxidermied antelope head and a flamboyant mural of a tigress and butterflies. A wall of glass looks out over Lenox Avenue, but the real scenery is inside.\n           \n\n            The downstairs dining room is calmer, with an intricate pattern traced on the exposed brick walls and a row of windows facing the garden, where a big communal table sits inside what looks like a giant birdcage. Maybe the peacock used to live there.\n           \n\n            The menu feels personal, too. It reminds me of the relaxed, light-handed, modern food that Americans with roots in India, like Ms. Trehan, may cook at home. Her recipes probably aren\u2019t her grandmother\u2019s, but she pays attention to the quality and balance of saffron, fenugreek, ginger and coriander. What comes out of her kitchen looks attractive, but it hasn\u2019t been whipped into stiff peaks of fine-dining artiness.\n           \n\n            I could imagine being invited to a dinner party where Chaiwali\u2019s smoked eggplant dip, full of garlic and juicy black olives, was put out with hot sheets of flatbread while everybody limbered up over cocktails.\n           \n\n            \u201cJust Samosas,\u201d as the menu calls them, might appear next. They have a potato-pea filling with a decidedly peppery bite. It\u2019s a treat to find samosa wrappers as thin and greaseless as these in a restaurant.\n           \n\n            In the winter, the first course could be Chaiwali\u2019s silky carrot soup, intensely flavored with saffron and a few fried curry leaves that float on the surface. In summer, maybe the appetizer would be the Goa shrimp ceviche, sweetened with little cubes of mango; the host would tell everybody to dump the little saucer of puffed rice and fried threads of chickpea flour over the top for crunch.\n           \n\n            Then, if you were in luck, she might carry vindaloo lamb chops to the table, having marinated the meat with vinegar for tenderness and ginger for flavor. Chaiwali makes vindaloo with complexity and nuance, nothing like the aggro-curry the color of a rusted tailpipe served in generic Indian restaurants. It comes with potatoes softly roasted with whole mustard seeds, a recipe that I am going to steal.\n           \n\n            Other main courses can expose the kitchen\u2019s vulnerabilities. The small pieces of black pepper chicken were dry both times I tried the dish. The pool of lightly curried tomato gravy helped, though, and I enjoyed the nutty and firm red quinoa served in place of the traditional rice.\n           \n\n            The okra fries served with the excellent saut\u00e9ed fish, seasoned with mustard seeds and herbs, then dredged in a delicate rice-flour batter, sounded great in theory. In practice, their crust was going soggy one night, and while it was quite crisp and hot on another, some of the long green pods, cut lengthwise, were a little stringy.\n           \n\n            Still, I\u2019d order either dish again, which I wouldn\u2019t say about the Desi pasta, which changes night to night but which, when I met up with it, was tossed with a shiitake-cream sauce. I remember nothing about it except the color, which I\u2019d call off-mustard. The clever veggie burger, a tall fritter of kale pakora with avocado, lettuce and tomato on a bun, made a more appealing meatless dinner.\n           \n\n            Desserts find a happy medium between too basic and too complicated. The one called Alice\u2019s Jamaican rum and biscuit pudding tastes something like a tiramis\u00f9 spiked with booze. Mango whipped with yogurt and goat cheese is like a lassi turned into a mousse. (There\u2019s an actual mango lassi on the drinks menu, and it\u2019s good, too.)\n           \n\n            The one dessert that scared me was the one I liked best: the curry cumin cookies. These little ginger-spiked bites, crumbly like shortbreads, are refreshing and bright, with a black pepper finish that took me by surprise in the best way.\n           \n\n            The cookies worked a small miracle that nothing else has ever accomplished: They actually made me want a cup of chai. But the chai at Chaiwali is not the lukewarm broth of dirty milk in a paper cup that you get in coffee shops. It is a potent mocha-colored drink, like a cortado made with strong black tea and spices.\n           \n\n            It was Ms. Trehan\u2019s desire for a cup of chai made the Indian way, the way she used to enjoy it in Delhi, that drove her to open Chaiwali. Of the many reasons people have for starting a restaurant, the desire to serve something they themselves want to eat and drink is one of the best.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 240, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/dining/chaiwali-review-indian-food-harlem.html", "google_mag": 24.700000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n         When\n         \n\n\n          Blanca\n         \n         opened in 2012, a 27-course tasting menu served at a counter behind a pizzeria in Bushwick sounded like the setup to a joke. (Second prize is 30 courses.) The restaurant does have its sense of humor, but it quickly proved that about cooking for maximum pleasure, it was unswervingly serious.\n        \n\n         Carlo Mirarchi, the chef and an owner of\n         \n          Blanca\n         \n         and its sprawling mother ship,\n         \n          Roberta\u2019s\n         \n         , was a rigorous miniaturist, combining a few ingredients at a time into two- or three-bite compositions that were utterly complete, even if they left you wanting more. At 31, he already had an impressive sense of what to put on a plate and what to leave off.\n        \n\n         What he didn\u2019t have yet was a repertoire deep enough for the length of the meals he served. My early dinners at Blanca were marked by dishes that seemed like placeholders, and there were moments when the kitchen\u2019s reach exceeded its technical grasp. It was as if Mr. Mirarchi were giving you a tour of a mansion he\u2019d bought before the contractor had finished the punch list. Most of the place was spectacular, but there were rooms where you would not want to spend the night.\n        \n\n         Being a critic, I had a suggestion, hinted at in\n         \n          my two-star review\n         \n         that year: make the meal shorter and cheaper. Being a chef, Mr. Mirarchi ignored me and kept refining his marathon tastings, very gradually.\n        \n\n         \u201cThe menu changes so slowly that for us it\u2019s like watching your hair grow,\u201d Leslie Vinyard, Blanca\u2019s welcoming and gracious service captain, remarked one night from behind the countertop. So it may have taken a while, but every time I\u2019ve settled into one of the padded brown-leather captain\u2019s chairs recently, nearly everything I\u2019ve tasted has been remarkable in one way or another.\n        \n\n         One dinner this spring got rolling with a fat little Pacific Northwest oyster. Sharing its deep cup-shaped shell were juicy round cells of finger lime that popped in my mouth like citrus caviar, and a pool of green juice pressed from roasted asparagus, an ingenious combination that teased a mild cucumber flavor out of the oyster.\n        \n\n         At the end of the night, asparagus came back. Samantha Short, the pastry chef, had made a sort of coconut semifreddo, silky on the tongue, which hovered over a spoonful or two of white asparagus soup seasoned with sugar and salt. Sweet and savory, tropical and vegetal flavors crashed together and bloomed into something daring and great. The desserts after some mega-tastings are gradual diminuendos. This was a mike drop.\n        \n\n         Over three meals since October, I\u2019ve experienced all sorts of flavor detonations: a streaky fold of raw pancetta with a burst of black peppercorns; a salt-roasted Japanese sweet potato with an unexpectedly dreamy dressing of macadamia milk and ground espresso beans; a crunchy wedge of tart apple carrying a small, remarkable payload of garlic, olive oil, anchovies, fried bread crumbs and cardoons cooked in apple juice.\n        \n\n         I have also started looking forward to sunchokes, a vegetable that has a hard time getting more out of me than grudging acceptance. Blanca caramelized them deeply, steeped them in soy milk, then whipped them into a cream. A ragged leaf of toasted sea lettuce supplied a bottom note, and the crumb of beeswax and honey at the bottom of the dish made my eyes go wide, every time.\n        \n\n         Then there are the agnolotti parcels that are like Freshen Up gum from the dark side. They burst when you bite down with an oozing, inky-green liquid made from melted taleggio and phytoplankton. The flavor is like a distillation of spinach, seaweed and squid ink. It\u2019s a totally disorienting sensation, and while I love it, not everyone will. I think of this course as the one guest-directed by\n         \n\n\n          David Lynch\n         \n         . It is when the\n         \n          dwarf starts to dance\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         One of Mr. Mirarchi\u2019s sillier conceits in the early days was making you wait more than two hours for an ordinary slice of filone, presented as its own course. You still wait, but now it\u2019s worth it. The breads made by Nina Subhas may include a soft Hawaiian sweet roll with pineapple juice in the dough and black salt on top, and a flaky garlic knot that\u2019s like a savory Danish. Or you may be given a chunk torn from a squat round loaf made from Roberta\u2019s pizza dough. Brushed with olive oil, this steaming-hot pizza bread doesn\u2019t need the house-made butter, not that I let that stop me.\n        \n\n         Once, grilled snow crabs were served with a deliciously funky crab-innards sauce. Now the steamed legs of very recently living king crabs come with a saffron-colored slosh of melted butter sauce whipped with shaved bottarga. The sauce is an upgrade, less likely to step on the sweetness of the shellfish, and I\u2019ve never again been served gelatinous, half-raw crab legs as I was in 2012. This has become one of New York\u2019s essential dishes, along with the \u2019nduja raviolo, an explosion of spicy pork lava, the one item that has been on the lineup since opening night.\n        \n\n         Mr. Mirarchi\u2019s notion of what al dente means seems to have softened. So has the pasta, slightly, but I\u2019ll deal with the extra-chewy core of tightly hand-rolled noodles to taste his creamy, yolk-rich carbonara with lamb fat and cured lamb breast.\n        \n\n         Beneath the body of Blanca\u2019s menu is an Italian chassis, so after pasta come the meat courses. There may be a few rosy slices of roast duck placed beside a slow-burning beet\n         \n\n\n          mole\n         \n         , followed by porchetta with chimichurri. The servings are never very large and never as hot as I\u2019d like, but the meat is always juicier and more concentrated than almost any other restaurant can manage.\n        \n\n         When you say \u201csavory desserts,\u201d some people look for the exits. None of these people have tasted Ms. Short\u2019s intermezzos and finales. She can make the heat and the vegetal taste of poblano peppers seem like sensible, delicious additions to a cake. One night, her parting shot was a chocolate-Parmesan ice cream with shaved white truffles. It was another mike drop.\n        \n\n         One could, and come to think of it one will, complain that Blanca offers no wine bottles under $80 and no glasses under $18. Customers who have torn a hole in their budget to afford the $195 for dinner, before\n         \n\n\n          tax\n         \n         and tip, shouldn\u2019t have to drink beer all night. Not that this would be a terrible fate; Blanca\u2019s beers are as varied and full of character as the sakes and wines. A course-by-course wine pairing can be had for $95, but Shanti Carson, the sommelier, excels at working with people who aren\u2019t that thirsty.\n        \n\n         Ms. Carson is also the one who placed the vinyl on the turntable when I decided to prove to the other 11 people at the counter that \u201c\n         \n          New York Groove\n         \n         \u201d isn\u2019t the only good song on Ace Frehley\u2019s first solo album.\n        \n\n         The record collection, which Mr. Mirarchi may well have lifted straight from the garage of his childhood home, is one of the ways Blanca deflates high-end dining\u2019s gassier pretensions. His aim has always been to run a restaurant that is both a luxury and a weird adventure. The entrance tells you everything. You walk into a cinder-block bomb shelter of a pizzeria, past the crowds eating pies with names like Lamb of God. You turn left at the bar, go out the door, take another left at the radio studio and a right at the tiki bar. Keep going past the shipping containers and the outdoor oven, walk down a couple of steps, through the door, and you\u2019re inside Bushwick\u2019s first three-star restaurant.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 242, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/17/dining/restaurant-review-blanca-in-bushwick-brooklyn.html", "google_mag": 30.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n            In its more peaceful hours,\n            \n             Achilles Heel\n            \n            , a revived waterfront bar with a painted stone facade in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, reminds me of\n            \n             McSorley\u2019s Old Ale House\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            At both places, you can rub the winter out of your hands near a hot stove (fueled by coal at McSorley\u2019s, firewood at Achilles) whose feet are propped on beat-up floorboards. Neither spot is in any hurry, and time there moves at a pace that is decidedly prehashtag. Their light has a faraway, amber quality you could call cheerful gloom. They are among the most soothing places in the city to cradle a glass while the day shortens and slips into the night.\n           \n\n            One area where the two diverge is food. John McSorley, who founded his East Village saloon in 1854, liked to eat whole raw onions like apples. Possibly for this reason, the kitchen at McSorley\u2019s has always taken a rough-and-ready approach. At Achilles Heel, the short menu is something else: thoughtful, engaging, subtle and intimate.\n           \n\n            It\u2019s less saloon cooking than wine-bar food. You can knock back some Muscadet and oysters with, instead of a garden-variety mignonette, a few thick, concentrated drops of a dressing that is intensely lemony but not sour. Or you can chase a mouthful of oloroso with a soft bite of a sheep\u2019s milk cheese called Puits d\u2019Astier, wrapped in a charred leaf of cabbage and griddled. It\u2019s a wonderful way to eat cheese.\n           \n\n            As at a wine bar in France, there are tartines, which everybody in New York decided one recent day to call \u201ctoasts.\u201d Fried bread showed through beneath sheets of sweetly melting lardo, uncannily good and flecked with Sichuan peppercorn. Toast jutted out of a bowl of fleshy, delicious black trumpet mushrooms in their own broth. Excellent, densely seeded bread came alongside fluke with pickled chiles; I\u2019d expected raw fluke, but it had been cured in salt and then restored, like bacalao, into an intensely flavored mash.\n           \n\n            The chef, Lee Desrosiers, cooks on induction burners in a space that looks just big enough to slice a baguette. In fact, it\u2019s the kitchen of a bar that was not supposed to have one. Andrew Tarlow, who restored Achilles Heel decades after the dockworkers who used to drink there heard the final last call, had the spot retrofitted last summer, in its third year of operation.\n           \n\n            From his butcher shop,\n            \n             Marlow & Daughters\n            \n            , he plucked Mr. Desrosiers, a meat cutter who had restaurant experience. His menu isn\u2019t especially meaty, but Mr. Desrosiers will use his knives in ways that the longshoreman who used to drink here probably didn\u2019t. Minced pork rib became a meditation on the Thai dish larb, with balls of sticky rice and a sauce of fresh green herbs.\n           \n\n            Early one night, Mr. Desrosiers put a plate of guinea hen galantine down on the bar. \u201cHere,\u201d he told the bartenders, \u201cI want you guys to try this.\u201d They took exploratory pecks at the thick wheels of pale pink meat broken by white windowpanes of fat, then they set upon the plate like vultures. I did the same when I got mine, swabbing it in a purple blob of chopped pickled radicchio and a circle of liver sauce on which he\u2019d laid a slice of the bird\u2019s heart.\n           \n\n            Having casually slouched into its role as a restaurant, Achilles Heel won\u2019t be everyone\u2019s idea of a dinner destination. Narrow-minded eaters may have a hard time with the limited, highly changeable menu. As the night goes on, the music becomes enveloping and the room fills with people who don\u2019t have food in their thoughts. If they start to crowd you out, finish your smoked ice cream with grapefruit sections and make your way out as you ask, where has the time gone?\n           \n\n\n\n            For those of us who had greedily dismantled Koren Grieveson\u2019s robust, emphatic cooking at Avec in Chicago, her move to New York a couple of years ago was promising news. She landed at Claudette, on lower Fifth Avenue, and while some of her Proven\u00e7al dishes were excellent, she seemed slightly miscast and left after a year.\n           \n\n            Last summer, she took over as the chef of a nine-year-old restaurant on East 29th Street called\n            \n             Resto\n            \n            . It is nominally Belgian, but its covert theme since its opening in 2007, the year\n            \n             Frank Bruni gave it a two-star review\n            \n            in The Times, has always been the glories of animal flesh and fat. This seems to suit Ms. Grieveson, whose cooking there has some of its old Avec swagger.\n           \n\n            Lamb ribs, a Resto fixture since the days of its first chef, Ryan Skeen, were deeply compelling in a dark, intense honey glaze with rosemary; lime juice gave them a lift that was unexpected and just right. A vadouvan aioli brought subtle harmonies to another bar snack, pink and juicy meatballs fried in bread crumbs.\n           \n\n            You don\u2019t often meet up with winter salads as dynamic as the one Ms. Grieveson puts together out of endive and celery root with mint, slivers of dried apricots and long twists of lamb bacon; the orange vinaigrette tasted like the sun coming out after a blizzard.\n           \n\n            Piled on thick rafts of bread, brandade turned out the way I always hope it will, often in vain, but not this time: fluffy and dense at once, with very tender and silky chunks of salt cod. I was really impressed by the Puy lentils served with crisp-skinned dorade; Ms. Grieveson had wonderfully cooked these earthy legumes with sweet and fruity black garlic.\n           \n\n            Other seafood dishes could be underwhelming; there wasn\u2019t much flavor in tiny remoulade-dressed shrimp served in a scooped-out November tomato, and hard little nubs of mussels undermined all the effort Ms. Grieveson put into steaming them with harissa, fennel, brussels sprouts and spaghetti squash.\n           \n\n            Desserts can seem like an afterthought, and one night I skipped them entirely because the other courses had taken forever to emerge from the kitchen.\n           \n\n            Ingredients that once walked on the land were a safer bet. Beautifully roasted duck and grapes were accented with gin underscored by juniper berries. Beef tongue braised in beer had a satisfying sear on the edges and a little extra crunch from flakes of sesame brittle. Nearly everything, whether cooked in beer or not, gets along nicely with it; the wonderful, often obscure bottles and drafts are Resto\u2019s strongest link with Belgium.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 243, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/27/dining/achilles-heel-resto-review.html", "google_mag": 25.0}, {"review_text": "\n            The news reports filled the city with gloom. From out of a big Manhattan real estate firm had come a change that few locals expected or wanted. Reactions were apocalyptic. There was a shared fear that we were moving in the wrong direction, that the values of our community were being trampled by dark, hostile forces.\n           \n\n            I speak, of course, of\n            \n             Union Square Cafe\u2019s losing its lease\n            \n            after 30 years, when the landlord decided in 2014 to drastically raise the rent for the space on East 16th Street. Danny Meyer\u2019s first restaurant, for many years one of the most beloved in New York, moved out. Writers and internet commenters saw it as another step toward a Manhattan in which independent and worthwhile restaurants can\u2019t make it. It seemed likely that the proposed $650,000-a-year rent would scare off any business that wasn\u2019t part of a chain.\n           \n\n            That part was true. But the chain that moved in turned out to be more interesting than another franchise selling lattes in paper cups or burgers in paper wrappers.\n           \n\n\n             TsuruTonTan Udon Noodle Brasserie\n            \n            is the first United States location for an operation that owns 13 restaurants in Japan. It\u2019s now easier to find a ramen shop in Manhattan than a mailbox, but udon specialists are rare. As far as I can tell, TsuruTonTan is the only one that mixes, kneads, rolls and cuts the dough for these long, pale wheat noodles on site.\n           \n\n            They have almost no flavor and are the opposite of delicate. But their consistency, the way they slide past your lips and spring back against your teeth, provides a distinct physical pleasure that will surprise anybody who has had only shaggy, overcooked udon that starts breaking apart before you have a chance to chew it.\n           \n\n            This is the rare restaurant where the servers\u2019 explanations of how to order is actually helpful. \u201cWith any of our udons, you can choose thick or thin noodles,\u201d I was told the first time I ate at TsuruTonTan. Thick ones are suggested for the hot soups, and thin for the chilled udon with dipping sauce on the side. \u201cYou can also order a large udon, which just means extra noodles, for the same price.\u201d\n           \n\n            I liked this place already, and I didn\u2019t change my mind after learning I wasn\u2019t allowed to take home leftovers. This rule is apparently not meant to encourage customers to act as if they\u2019re in the Nathan\u2019s hot dog eating contest; our server said the restaurant just hadn\u2019t found takeout cartons it was happy with.\n           \n\n            Following instructions, I ordered my chilled udon with thin noodles, about the diameter of bucatini. In TsuruTonTan\u2019s uni udon, they were slicked down with a majestically rich sauce of sea urchin and dashi. In the zaru udon, they had been wound in a loose figure eight like yarn and placed on ice chips. Before I got to eat them, I had a job to do, mashing sesame seeds with a birch pestle and stirring them together into a soy dipping sauce with scallions and ginger. It\u2019s a summer dish. I responded to the cold splash of udon in my mouth with an appreciative shiver in October.\n           \n\n            Under the direction of the chef, Tomoya Tamaru, the menu switch-hits between soups with this kind of lean Japanese purity and more zaftig concoctions. In the first category are the soups with sliced duck breast or the one with Wagyu rib-eye shavings slowly warming on the surface of a carefully balanced broth. Both broths are built on a deeply savory and focused dashi, although the rib-eye shavings were a little too hard to locate in a dish costing $19. The broths, savory with fish and seaweed, did not taste fatty or leave me with that sensation of having swallowed a boiled football that I sometimes get from ramen.\n           \n\n            On Team Zaftig, we have bowls like \u201ctruffle cr\u00e8me with mushroom,\u201d a full-on swoon in which Parmigiano-Reggiano, cream and truffle oil swirl together into a kind of Japanese Alfredo. The broth is so intensely creamy I couldn\u2019t finish it, but that\u2019s no sin in an udon restaurant.\n           \n\n            TsuruTonTan\u2019s Japanese curry is more sauce than soup, too. The thick liquid is not especially spicy, but it is very good with a tonkatsu-style pork cutlet, tempura shrimp and shaved beef in the $23 \u201ccurry deluxe.\u201d I was less taken by the mentaiko broth; the scoop of spicy cod roe in the middle of the bowl didn\u2019t save the soup from tasting a little heavy-handed.\n           \n\n            In Japan, like most udon specialists, TsuruTonTan mostly sticks to its noodles. To woo New York, the company whipped up a bunch of new donburi and appetizers such as spicy tuna cones, heavily accessorized sashimi, and fried chunks of chicken in a tartar sauce the color of borscht.\n           \n\n            Rather than describing each individually, I\u2019ll share a handy method I came up with for dealing with all of them at once. Unfold\n            \n             the menu\n            \n            and place it on the table so that you see the noodle dishes. The reverse side, with the appetizers and donburi, will be face down. Now, never turn the menu over. If you have accidentally learned the name of a dish printed there, don\u2019t say it out loud.\n           \n\n            Even when TsuruTonTan is very good, you never forget that it\u2019s a chain. But if you leave aside the stuff it shouldn\u2019t be serving anyway, it\u2019s a very impressive chain.\n           \n\n            Soups come in heavy, gorgeous ceramic bowls made by Japanese potteries that have access to intensely colorful glazes. The larger ones are big enough to give a puppy a bath in.\n           \n\n            Servers are well versed in the menu, paying close attention when somebody at the table told them about a food allergy. Although they\u2019re busy when the place fills up, they take time to greet customers on the way in and the way out, and they\u2019ll guide you to the restroom as if they were working in a much more formal restaurant.\n           \n\n            Several times, I got to watch people who had not realized where they were sitting suddenly recognize\n            \n             the bones of Union Square Cafe\n            \n            . The space has lost its old dowdiness and gained an energetic horizontality that makes a virtue of the low ceilings, though the design doesn\u2019t do much to dampen the noise.\n           \n\n            The crowd is different now, of course, with a lot of young Japanese noodle enthusiasts. As I looked around, the anger directed at the remorseless workings of the rental market seemed misplaced.\n           \n\n            The engines of New York real estate may plow under the past, but they also clear the ground for new opportunities. A far more direct threat to the values of the New York dining community is the snarling hostility to immigrants now at loose in the country. As a restaurant critic, I am very concerned about where this will lead.\n           \n\n            New Yorkers have been told lately that they live in a bubble, but it is a large bubble with room for people from many other countries and cultures. Real estate shapes the city\u2019s food scene, but a longstanding openness to different ways of cooking and living, a curiosity about Yemeni roast lamb or Oaxacan mole or Japanese noodle soup, defines it.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 244, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/dining/tsurutontan-udon-noodle-brasserie-restaurant-review.html", "google_mag": 25.0}, {"review_text": "\n         So this is where he decides to bring us: back to the same place on Spring Street where it all started. The year was 2002, the restaurant was called\n         \n          Fiamma\n         \n         , and he was just another hungry 29-year-old chef from the Midwest. We didn\u2019t know yet that his name was\n         \n\n\n          Michael White\n         \n         . We just knew that when he cooked Italian food, he could make us forget about all the others for a while.\n        \n\n         Now he has bought the place and renamed it Costata. This time around it\u2019s a steakhouse. He is credited as the chef and owner, with PJ Calapa as the executive chef and Robert Truitt in charge of the dessert menu. But he definitely wants us to remember the early days here, and maybe reassure us that even though he\u2019s been spending a lot of time on the road lately, we still mean something to him.\n        \n\n         All those Foreigner and Stone Temple Pilots songs aren\u2019t helping to set the mood. And those huge white cotton chandeliers with accordion folds are distracting. They look like air filters for monster-truck engines.\n        \n\n         The votives are a nice romantic touch. Except those aren\u2019t candles; they\u2019re flame-shaped light bulbs programmed to flicker on and off. They fit right in with the jokey space-age d\u00e9cor at\n         \n          the Butterfly\n         \n         , his new bar in TriBeCa. But on Costata\u2019s white tablecloths, they look cheap.\n        \n\n         And these teapots are sleek and shiny, but he\u2019s sending them out two at a time, one with a tea bag and hot water, the other with just hot water, because a single pot won\u2019t fill a teacup. He wouldn\u2019t buy us teapots just because they were on sale, would he? Or is this ... a regift?\n        \n\n         But tonight let\u2019s stay focused on the good times. To remind us, he\u2019s making the garganelli he used to do at Fiamma, those ridged quills with peas, pancetta and, oh, that truffle cream. Wow. As indecently rich as we remembered it.\n        \n\n         This spaghetti with clams almost eats like carbonara, with its sticky yellow-tinged sauce that clings to the noodles. The casarecci, bent scrolls blackened with squid ink, have a powerful oceanic undertow that pulls the sweet shrimp and sepia along in the current.\n        \n\n         For a minute, we\u2019re wondering if he\u2019s laying it on a bit thick, showering shredded fontina over the oxtail rag\u00f9 with cavatelli. Then we take another bite and decide that when somebody makes pasta as wonderful as this, there are some questions you just don\u2019t ask. Though we do want to know how many people take the menu\u2019s advice and order pasta as a side dish with steak. Costata\u2019s pasta shouldn\u2019t have to compete with anything.\n        \n\n         We should know. We\u2019re never sure we\u2019re getting his full attention anymore. He\u2019s a blur, opening three restaurants since May. He didn\u2019t seem to be trying very hard to make us happy with his last one in New York,\n         \n          Nicoletta\n         \n         . Now he\u2019s got something going on\n         \n          in Hong Kong\n         \n         , and\n         \n          in London\n         \n         . And who knows what he does at those two places in\n         \n\n\n          New Jersey\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         If he wants to persuade us he\u2019s not spread too thin, some of the cooking at Costata isn\u2019t helping his case. Raw branzino is obliterated under a black mash of salty taggiasca olives, although what little of the fish\u2019s flavor comes through suggests that obliteration may be the right call. Potatoes pur\u00e9ed with barrels of melted butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano taste great, but they are gluey and oafish.\n        \n\n         The brilliant-red coral butter painted on a split and roasted lobster the size of a dachshund looks stunning, but it\u2019s irretrievably salty. And the generic red-meat flavor of lamb chops is a $49 shock.\n        \n\n         Some of these dishes have a coarseness that wasn\u2019t there when we first met, or even later on, when he took us to\n         \n          Convivio\n         \n         and\n         \n          Alto\n         \n         and\n         \n          Marea\n         \n         . And the relationship feels a little one-sided now. If we had given him $59 for a bone-in rib-eye back when he was so eager to impress, would he have turned around and asked for another $3 for compound butter and $4 for sauce?\n        \n\n         Or maybe our memories have gone all misty and watercolored.\n        \n\n         Oh, now he\u2019s going to try to sweep us off our feet again with crudo, the way he did at Marea. We\u2019ve seen this move before.\n        \n\n         And you know what? Apart from that sad branzino, the old moves still work. Those beautiful red prawns with lemon, olive oil and a prawn-head stock are extraordinarily fine. So is the fluke, sparkling beside the green divots of Castelvetrano olives and slow-roasted grape tomatoes. And these thin disks of sea scallop, so sweet and pure on a blanket of pur\u00e9ed celeriac, with diced celeriac pickle and fresh, herbal celery leaves \u2014 they\u2019d destroy our resistance even without the head-filling taste of black truffles in the vinaigrette.\n        \n\n         All right, the guy\u2019s a magician with seafood, too. Roasted langoustines had better be exceptional at $19 apiece. They are. We\u2019d come back for a second taste of the chilled lumps of tender lobster with strips of honey-coated guanciale cooked like bacon and a thick cocktail sauce that delivers a Bloody Mary\u2019s loving slap to the head.\n        \n\n         The truth is that we always loved his gut instinct for richness and fresh, bright flavors. We don\u2019t really need him to cook us a steak. But by now we\u2019re ready to be won over.\n        \n\n         The filet mignon delivers all the tenderness we want and more flavor than we expect. Pink within and a rich caramel brown on top, the veal chop is everything we ask from that cut. The pancetta-black pepper sauce takes to it the way a cat takes to an empty lap.\n        \n\n         The bone-in strip is a very good piece of beef, though it doesn\u2019t have the intensity of the best dry-aged meat. Neither does the 40-ounce porterhouse, though big enough for at least two people, for $116. Called the Fiorentina, it\u2019s a handsome carnation-pink all the way through, but it has no crust to speak of and is lukewarm on arrival. It\u2019s all steak and no sizzle.\n        \n\n         For sizzle, we\u2019ll spend $2 more to get the Costata, a 44-ounce rib-eye on the end of a theatrical curve of roasted bone. Bathed in mouth-coating melted fat, the meat is so tender beneath its dark crust that slicing it makes you feel like a bully. This steak alone is a reason for the restaurant that it\u2019s named after to exist.\n        \n\n         When the meal ends, Mr. Truitt is a master of extending the good feelings and then building on them, with desserts that are quietly sophisticated without flaunting their cleverness.\n        \n\n         Things aren\u2019t the way they used to be. They\u2019re not quite the way we pictured them in the beginning. But give us the cavatelli and a rib-eye, or a few langoustines, and for tonight, we\u2019ll be happy.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 247, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/14/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-costata-in-soho.html", "google_mag": 27.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n            At some fateful moment in the 13th century when Kublai Khan was preparing to lead the Mongol hordes into battle, hunger struck.

Besides serving as an inspiration to those of us who believe there is always time to eat, the chef\u2019s impromptu recipe is said to have given China its ancient and delicious hot pot tradition.\n           \n\n            Hot pots did not jump to Japan until shortly after World War II, when kelp joined the broth and the name was changed, onomatopoetically, to shabu shabu. But like hot pots in China, shabu shabu is a do-it-yourself bash where everybody around the table gets to dunk and swish the ingredients they like best. Chefs are not required.\n           \n\n            Then on Delancey Street last fall, a new shabu shabu restaurant appeared where a chef standing behind a counter does all the cooking for no more than eight people at a time. Her name is Mako Okano. Out of a style of dining that has always been a big, informal free-for-all, she has built a quiet, refined, intimate spot called\n            \n             Shabushabu Macoron\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            Usually backed up by two other women, but occasionally working solo, Ms. Okano moves deliberately. She will gesture to the place mat, where the night\u2019s eight or 10 courses are written out in Japanese, right to left, and then to another slip of paper with the same courses printed in English, again right to left. The price is $128. There are no choices to be made. Ms. Okano has modeled her restaurant on omakase sushi bars, where the chef calls the tune.\n           \n\n            When I first arrived, I admit that I couldn\u2019t see the point of having a chef do the cooking when I was perfectly able to do my own dunking and swishing. Ms. Okano quickly poured two or three mouthfuls of yeasty, warm unfiltered sake into a little saucer. This arrived with a snack \u2014 cured salmon and salmon roe seasoned with fermented rice \u2014 that artfully underscored the sake\u2019s flavor.\n           \n\n            Then she turned and quietly addressed a saut\u00e9 pan over the stove. When she turned around again she had cooked an omelet and flicked it into a roll in the Japanese style. Served in a bowl of hot, clear dashi, the egg was as tender and delicate as its garnish, a tiny piece of mitsuba stem tied into a knot.\n           \n\n            Next she poached two pieces of abalone for a few seconds each in abalone broth. One she dabbed with a small, intense blip of the Japanese spice paste yuzu kosho. Over the other she spooned a sauce made from the abalone\u2019s liver. I ate them both, and was flooded first with pleasure then with embarrassment that I\u2019d thought simmered food wasn\u2019t worth a chef\u2019s time.\n           \n\n            By the time I\u2019d eaten a small tongue of sea urchin combined with silky rags of yuba still dripping with soy milk, I was on board for anything Ms. Okano wanted to cook.\n           \n\n            For some time the bubbles in an iron pot of dashi set over a countertop burner had been getting bigger and faster. Thin strips of Wagyu beef, streaked with so much fat they looked like stained glass, were stretched out on black slate with pinkish bands of pork belly. Raw vegetables \u2014 cabbage, lettuce, enoki and shiitake mushrooms, half a brussels sprout and a cherry tomato on a wooden spear \u2014 waited on a nearby plate.\n           \n\n            Before I knew it she had cooked the first piece of beef \u2014 was it the A5 from Miyazaki or the A4 from Kagoshima? The flesh had twisted itself around, and now dusk-gray outer curls hid inner curves of faded pink. The flavors moved in rapid waves: first a few clinging, savory drops of dashi, then some already-melted beef fat, followed by the flavor of the lean meat itself, sweet and refined. Finally came a second helping of fat, freshly melted now.\n           \n\n            When Ms. Okano fished out a piece of beef, she would suggest seasoning it with one or more of an almost comically large assortment of condiments and pur\u00e9es that she makes herself. She seemed to favor her ponzu, and so do I; it\u2019s more radiant with yuzu than any I\u2019ve had before. I also liked the sweet soy once I learned to doctor it with a few drops of what Ms. Okano calls \u201cgravy sauce,\u201d a dark liquid that makes meat taste meatier. Many dismal meals would be saved if I carried an eyedropper of gravy sauce around with me.\n           \n\n            Swabbing the pork belly in the sticky, thick sesame paste with toasted sesame seeds produces an effect similar to, but more subtle than, the combination of peanut butter and bacon. It\u2019s even better with a smear of salted plum, or a few drops of the yuzu-olive oil sauce that seems to have jetted in from Italy.\n           \n\n            The vegetables were spotless and fresh. A meal without them would be off kilter, perhaps to a degree that would cause grumbling from the digestive system, but on their own they are not a reason to go to Shabushabu Macoron.\n           \n\n            The chicken meatballs are, though. So are the green tea soba noodles that Ms. Okano somehow manages to cook in between everything else without seeming to leave the few square feet behind the counter. Soba is not standard with shabu shabu, but it is something she has experience making from her time in the kitchen at\n            \n             Cocoron\n            \n            , a soba-ya across Delancey Street. When she began talking about her dream of opening what she hoped would be the world\u2019s first omakase shabu shabu restaurant, Cocoron\u2019s owners listened. When she came back from a dunk-and-swish tour of Japan, they signed on as her partners.\n           \n\n            At times, it seems as if Ms. Okano can\u2019t believe it all worked out. After she\u2019d cooked me three nearly identical meals, I wondered if she\u2019d still be as giddy a year from now. Will she be able to change the menu with the seasons to keep things interesting? Can she stash surprise ingredients below the counter for repeat customers, the way sushi chefs do?\n           \n\n            None of these questions occurred to me the first two times I ate at her restaurant. I just sat there in something like a state of wonder while she cooked for me. This is, bizarrely, a rare experience at tasting counters, where chefs are often intent on intricacies of plating.\n           \n\n            The physical setting of Shabushabu Macoron strongly suggests a shoestring budget \u2014 the paper towel roll in the restroom hangs from what may be an actual shoestring \u2014 but sitting there while Ms. Okano stands a few inches away and makes your dinner is one of the most luxurious experiences this city currently offers.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 248, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/dining/shabushabu-macoron-review.html", "google_mag": 26.200000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n            Real estate developers used to wait for restaurants to illuminate the sidewalks before they\u2019d start investing in a neighborhood. They don\u2019t wait anymore. If there\u2019s no\n            \n             Florent\n            \n            or\n            \n             Schiller\u2019s Liquor Bar\n            \n            around, they simply have one built, synchronizing the opening with the move-in date of the first new apartments.\n           \n\n            This is the tactic being used by\n            \n             Hudson Yards\n            \n            , the glass-and-steel mountain range rising above a one-time dining wasteland where soon not just restaurants but an entire \u201crestaurant collection\u201d will flourish, including new projects from David Chang, Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s and others,\n            \n             all \u201ccurated\u201d by Thomas Keller\n            \n            . And it is the approach taken by Henry Hall, a tower of rental apartments just north of Hudson Yards on West 38th Street. To give the place the atmosphere and the hangout opportunities of a boutique hotel, Henry Hall has turned its first two floors over to a wine shop, a cocktail lounge, a private dining room and a restaurant.\n           \n\n            I am telling you all this because that restaurant, Legacy Records, is unusually good and very popular and if somebody invites you there, you should know why you are having dinner down the street from the Javits Convention Center and\n            \n             a stable where Central Park carriage horses go\n            \n            to be hosed down at night. And you will also know why Legacy Records seems eager to suggest that it has local roots \u2014 so eager that it has essentially ginned up a history for itself that brings together sloppy research with a superficial tribute to black culture. It\u2019s not a combination that will appeal to everybody.\n           \n\n            Like the bar and the wine store, Legacy Records is run by Delicious Hospitality, the company behind\n            \n             Pasquale Jones\n            \n            and\n            \n             Charlie Bird\n            \n            . The menu, as it is in those two restaurants, is essentially Italian, but less rustic and more expensive. This is the first time the group has routinely charged more than $30, and as much as $46, for main courses. (The prices, like the ones at Pasquale Jones but not Charlie Bird, include service.)\n           \n\n            I don\u2019t know for sure whether Ryan Hardy, the chef and one of the three partners, has upgraded to better purveyors, but I do know I was taken aback, often, by the quality of the raw ingredients at Legacy Records.\n           \n\n            There was the raw sea scallop, so intensely fresh that its slices clung together stickily; Mr. Hardy had dressed it with dots of yogurt, tiny oval basil leaves, toasted almonds and tart little pink cells of finger lime. There was chilled Dungeness crab, a few pristine white chunks under sea urchin foam, to be spooned from a shot glass. And tiles of yellowfin tuna belly, not as fatty as bluefin but very rich all the same, under bits of salted lemon peel and a splash of colatura, the Italian fish sauce.\n           \n\n            Again with the main courses, I stopped and wondered: Where did Mr. Hardy find lamb (with snap peas and smoked cream) that tasted as if it had never eaten anything but fresh herbs? How did he find a rib-eye that\u2019s so tender and deeply flavorful without being flabby?\n           \n\n            Mr. Hardy has been quick to make the most of what the market says is the first month of spring and the calendar says is the last. Creamy new-crop potatoes deserve a little appreciation before they\u2019re sent off to root cellars, and Mr. Hardy built a fine appetizer around them with leggy broccoli sprouts and melting chunks of fresh mozzarella spiked with anchovy.\n           \n\n            Charred snap peas made a tangy salad together with ramps in a peppery buttermilk dressing. But sweet English peas were swallowed up by a too-sharp risotto; seasoned with prosciutto, the rice took on more of the ham\u2019s saltiness than its sweetness.\n           \n\n            Legacy Records doesn\u2019t say anything particularly original, but it has a finesse that\u2019s new for this restaurant group. There\u2019s an exceptional plate of grilled pigeon, neatly carved and served with swooshes of nettle pur\u00e9e. It is at least as impressive as the dish that\u2019s becoming a breakout star for the restaurant: a duck breast, its skin rubbed with pepper, chiles, honey and fennel and then roasted until it has a deep, crusty bark that a Texas pitmaster would be proud of.\n           \n\n            Ordering wine is an event in itself. Robert Bohr and Grant Reynolds, who are Mr. Hardy\u2019s partners and the resident wine soothsayers, have seen to it that cultists can rub elbows with the Agraparts, Raveneaus and Gajas, while the rest of us will still find a few bottles under $100 from some of the most expensive arable land on earth.\n           \n\n            Oddly enough, the wine list makes less of an impression than the ones at Charlie Bird and Pasquale Jones, simply because you\u2019d expect an ambitious cellar in a restaurant this expensive.\n           \n\n            Then again you might also expect a smart, artful dessert menu; if so, you\u2019re out of luck. There is ice cream with strawberries, a dark chocolate meringue and a selection of gelati, served in a cone; all perfectly pleasant, but there\u2019s more wit and creativity in the excellent cocktail roster administered by Jeff Bell.\n           \n\n            I\u2019m sure there are people who are reluctant to go to Legacy Records because of how relentlessly noisy this team\u2019s downtown restaurants are. But they seem to have sent the acoustics to obedience school, because all the sound waves do what they\u2019re told: Conversations stay at their own tables, while the music stays in the background.\n           \n\n            Ken Fulk, who designed all the public spaces in the building, covered some wall panels with grasscloth, put glove-soft leather on the tabletops, and found other ways to dampen the noise. Legacy Records certainly doesn\u2019t look like any other restaurant; Mr. Fulk went to extremes, using some motifs from the 1980s \u2014 emphatic grids, metallic finishes, whites and country-club greens \u2014 that not everybody is ready to see resurrected.\n           \n\n            Hanging in the bar is a 2006 photograph by the artist\n            \n             Mickalene Thomas\n            \n            of a black woman with an Afro and a giraffe-print shirt posed in front of albums by Stevie Wonder and Diana Ross. It has a counterpart on the second floor, a mural behind the bar based on the Ernie Barnes painting seen on\n            \n             Marvin Gaye\u2019s album \u201cI Want You.\u201d\n            \n            Along with the constant hip-hop and vintage soul soundtrack and the restaurant\u2019s name \u2014 taken, we are told, from a recording studio that once stood on this site \u2014 Legacy Records tries to present itself as a homage to another era in music.\n           \n\n            If Legacy Recording Studios had been used by Mr. Gaye, Mr. Wonder and Ms. Ross, that homage might make sense. But it didn\u2019t. Lasting just from 2001 to 2009, the studio was built for and mostly used by orchestras, Broadway cast recordings and commercials. Legacy Records has taken this shred of history and turned it into a fantasy of black American music.\n           \n\n            Exhibited in a museum or gallery, Ms. Thomas\u2019s photo might be taken as a comment on the different postures and personas available to black women. Hanging it next to the counter where pastries and coffee are sold by day strips out some of its meaning; it looks like an attempt to buy a personality for a restaurant that doesn\u2019t have one of its own.\n           \n\n            If anyone gets to decide who can use black culture for what purposes, it surely isn\u2019t me. But Legacy Records uses it in a gratuitous and offhanded way that made me uncomfortable. Stevie Wonder will always be cool, but a restaurant dreamed up by real estate developers doesn\u2019t automatically become cool by putting him on the wall.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 249, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/dining/legacy-records-review.html", "google_mag": 24.0}, {"review_text": "\n         We have our swamis of salumi in New York restaurants, our chieftains of charcuterie, our sultans of sausage. But where are the wizards of wurst? Who will carry the flag for the multitude of cured and smoked meats that flourish in the German-speaking lands?\n        \n\n         Harold Dieterle, please step forward. At his new restaurant, the\n         \n          Marrow\n         \n         , Mr. Dieterle leads off the menu with compound words from the lexicon of German butchery. A meal there might start with excellent j\u00e4gerwursts, salty, pink little sausages split and dotted with drops of violet mustard that run down the center like buttons on a cuff. There is liverwurst, too, not the sinister tube that lurks in sad deli cases but a rich paste of duck liver ground with nutmeg and allspice.\n        \n\n         Mr. Dieterle, who won the first season of \u201cTop Chef,\u201d then gambled his prize money and his recipe for spicy duck meatballs to open a restaurant called Perilla, thinks globally. At\n         \n          Perilla\n         \n         , where Garett McMahan now oversees a kitchen that is both adventurous and finely tuned, chermoula and labneh might share the table with aji amarillo chiles. With his second place,\n         \n          Kin Shop\n         \n         , Mr. Dieterle made an unexpected and welcome digression into Thai cuisine seen through a Western fine-dining lens.\n        \n\n         The Marrow looks abroad again, but this time his destination is home. Half his menu is inspired by his father\u2019s German roots. The other half draws from the Italian cuisine of his mother and her relatives. The two trunks of the family tree are stamped on the menu: Famiglia Chiarelli on the left, with the polenta and the fettuccine; on the right, with sauerkraut and schnitzel, Familie Dieterle.\n        \n\n         But another, invisible line divides the menu, too. It is the split between dishes that are completely sure of their purpose and the ones so overembellished it\u2019s unclear what the idea was meant to be.\n        \n\n         One minute, the Marrow would send out something as concise and well considered as an appetizer of shredded duck leg pressed into a brick under a crackling sheet of skin, with a top layer of huckleberries providing all the counterpoint that the duck needed.\n        \n\n         The next, out would come skillfully cooked salmon covered by a sprawling haystack of cabbage and carrot slaw. The vegetables, underseasoned and underdressed, seemed to need something. Could it be ... nuggets of pastrami?\n        \n\n         No, but that\u2019s what they got. Like a flustered person who isn\u2019t sure what to say, the dish rambled on without coming to the point. Order unwisely and the table can be overcome by this kind of nervous chatter.\n        \n\n         Luckily, many aspects of the Marrow need no editing at all. Ginger Fisher\u2019s dessert lineup goes from one pleasure to another. I\u2019m not sure I will ever find another turnover as appealing as the Marrow\u2019s apple hand pie, a triangle of tender, buttery crust folded around sliced fruit, but if I do, I\u2019ll want to swab it, too, in a dark pool of caramel, then go back for a forkful of quark ice cream.\n        \n\n         And the next time I go for a doughnut run, I hope I collide with Ms. Fisher\u2019s Berliners, soft and white, filled with cinnamon-schnapps cream and served over a rewardingly complex chocolate ganache.\n        \n\n         At this point, readers who have stayed for dessert at the Marrow are jumping up and down in their seats, shouting, \u201cWhat about the ginger stout cake?\u201d I was just getting to that. A wedge of sticky, crunchy gingerbread served with roasted, spiced pears, it has an intense bittersweetness derived from the combination of molasses and stout. It really is worth jumping up and down about.\n        \n\n         So is the wine list assembled by Jill Roberts, particularly if you prize the incandescent energy and clarity of Austrian and German whites. One night, looking out at the West Village streets through the glass windows that frame this bent elbow of a dining room, I decided it would be smart to keep drinking wine at the Marrow until I\u2019d memorized the position of every umlaut on that list. I might never learn to pronounce Smaragd, but I\u2019d be a happy man.\n        \n\n         I\u2019d stay happy, too, if I ordered well. I\u2019d come back again to carve into the great golden expanse of the duck schnitzel, miraculously crisp and almost juicy. I\u2019d sit at the bar and dip the fat lamb ribs into their caraway yogurt, chewing on the caramelized edges like jerky.\n        \n\n         Mr. Dieterle has an odd but very good interpretation of vitello tonnato, with the part of the veal roast played by deep-fried sweetbreads. (The part of tuna sauce is played by tuna sauce; a wreckfish fillet takes on a previously unknown role that is well suited to the ensemble.)\n        \n\n         His roasted bone marrow seemed odd at first, too, with scoops of sea urchin sitting along the trench of shinbone like ice cream scoops on a nose-to-tail banana split. But Mr. Dieterle knew what he was up to, juxtaposing two ingredients that felt almost the same in your mouth, but not quite. It was a pun on textures, a delicious joke that you got with your tongue.\n        \n\n         Some dishes, though, made me wonder whether I\u2019d missed the punch line. I wasn\u2019t sure why anyone would go to the trouble of making salt cod into smooth and subtle dumplings, only to drown them out with chunks of spicy pickled peppers, golden raisins and a too-sweet broth.\n        \n\n         I squinted and stared at a precarious tower formed by stacking one half of a chicken on top of the other half and balancing both on a bizarre hash of brussels sprouts, batons of salami and cubes of bread. The menu called this a panzanella, after the Italian salad built around tomato-drenched bread, but these cubes were hard and dry, unmoved by their contact with the other ingredients.\n        \n\n         One night there was a special of garganelli puttanesca with bottarga and tuna marrow, a clear jelly found inside the fish\u2019s spine. \u201cWe recommend stirring the marrow into the pasta,\u201d our server said. We complied, and still thought the sauce too meek and the bottarga too pushy.

It appeared to be a casual pile of squid tempura interlaced with a few splinters of fried green stuff, but I took a knife to it and quartered it anyway. Amazingly, the gold loops and strands held together as they traveled from the dish of spicy dipping sauce to my mouth.\n        \n\n         As I ate, I understood that Hanjan\u2019s chef, Hooni Kim, had accomplished the most delicious kind of engineering feat, minimizing the layer of rice starch that makes up the bulk of a traditional pajeon and maximizing not just the crisp fried bits but also the flavor of scallions and wonderfully fresh squid. At the same time, his pajeon held on to the essential taste of Korean cuisine. This taller, airier pajeon was nowhere near as filling as the original, but I didn\u2019t mind. Planning ahead, I had ordered two.\n        \n\n\n          Hanjan\n         \n         opened in December on West 26th Street, its recessed entrance easy to miss alongside rowdy neighbors like Hill Country and the Hog Pit. Like Mr. Kim\u2019s slightly older restaurant,\n         \n          Danji\n         \n         , Hanjan has a menu divided between traditional Korean dishes (the pajeon) and new ideas (slices of raw wild salmon that you wrap around salad greens in a spicy sesame dressing). And once again, the cover versions and the original compositions are so much in touch with the spirit of Korean cooking that it can be hard to tell which is which.\n        \n\n         Hanjan does not cast out any obvious chum for food bloggers the way Danji did with its\n         \n          bulgogi sliders\n         \n         and bacon paella. Mr. Kim may be more confident in his cooking this time around, or more certain that New Yorkers will get it. On a menu of mostly small dishes, one of the two substantial enough to anchor a meal is a large bowl of cod roe in a cloudy seafood broth that contains so much chile paste, it\u2019s pink. Both the esoteric main ingredient and the fearless seasoning in this remarkable stew suggest that Mr. Kim trusts his audience, and vice versa.\n        \n\n         Certainly, the relationship has progressed to the point where he can name one of Hanjan\u2019s dishes fresh killed chicken wings.\n         \n          Just how fresh\n         \n         , you may wonder, tilting an ear toward the kitchen to listen for muffled squawks. Not quite as fresh as that; the birds are slaughtered off site earlier in the day that they are served. The object is to obtain poultry with a clean and full flavor, which Mr. Kim simply underlines by marinating the wings in sake and soy and grilling them.\n        \n\n         Other parts of those recently graduated birds end up skewered and grilled, yakitori style, with minimal seasoning. You need to love the flavor of extremely fresh chicken to love most of these skewers, especially the very chewy gizzards. The crunchy accordion folds of grilled skin are probably universally appealing, though. Two of my guests, at least, declared them the best thing on the table.\n        \n\n         A minute later, they claimed to have found something better. All my meals at Hanjan were like that, with new dishes eclipsing the memory of what had come before. \u201cThat\u2019s my favorite of the night,\u201d somebody would say, chopsticks pinched around a fried sandwich of shrimp and pork paste between shiso leaves. A few minutes later, somebody else would crown the grilled mackerel fillet, its skin gleaming like candy under a glassy soy glaze, accompanied by a lemon and grated daikon. Next the torch was passed to meaty slices of pig trotter braised in soy and smeared with a far-from-tame paste of fermented shrimp and soy beans.\n        \n\n         In the rush to declare winners, a few also-rans were soon forgotten. To be a contender in a town full of good Korean fried chicken, Hanjan\u2019s needs to be crisper than it was the night I had it. A tiny portion of noodles with spicy squid vanished without impact. Thin slices of fish cakes bobbed around in a nearly clear seafood broth that was very, very good, but the dish wasn\u2019t substantial enough for a restaurant that is, essentially, a Korean pub.\n        \n\n         Mr. Kim\u2019s small-plates approach leads to one significant miscalculation. Hanjan charges $5 for kimchi and $4 for cold appetizers called namul. Order both and you have a small but high-quality banchan spread, which most Korean restaurants bring without charge or request. By putting a price on banchan, Mr. Kim makes it optional, just another tapas plate. Without it, the whole spirit of the meal changes.\n        \n\n         Lines of two-tops and four-tops run along opposite walls; in the center is a long communal table that might feel like trend-chasing in another restaurant but here feels like an invitation to put your elbows down and have another bottle of sake. After 8 p.m. you will need it, because the din from hungry-eyed people waiting at the bar and the customers at their tables shouting to one another that everybody needs to try the pork fat rice cakes (they\u2019re right) will be bouncing off the concrete walls and the steel ceilings.\n        \n\n         After a while, you may get curious about the cloudy, oatmeal-colored drink served in frosty mugs. It is makgeolli, a yeasty rice brew with the soft sweetness of cantaloupe. By 10 or so, the crowds may thin a bit and there might be a seat at the bar. This is good because that is when the ramen broth is finally ready, after bubbling in a pot for half a day with the bones of fish and pork and chicken. Ramen is listed on the menu as ramyun, one of the large plates, which implies sharing. I recommend eating it alone at the bar, where you can have all four slices of sweet pork to yourself and make as much noise as you want slurping the bouncy, squiggly noodles out of the steaming and chile-hot soup.\n        \n\n         The ramen shows up on the modern side of the menu, even though nothing about its long-simmered, bone-rich flavor tastes 21st century. But Mr. Kim is now the city\u2019s leading interpreter of Korean cuisine, and if he says the dish is modern, the rest of us will have to believe him.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 252, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/03/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-hanjan-in-manhattan.html", "google_mag": 23.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n         Expectations are everything.\n        \n\n         It was hard to know what to expect when\n         \n          April Bloomfield\n         \n         , the British-born chef who has been New York\u2019s chief importer of the gastro-pub ethos since she opened\n         \n          the Spotted Pig\n         \n         , announced that her latest project would be called Salvation Taco.\n        \n\n         Although she consulted with the chef of two local Mexican restaurants, Roberto Santiba\u00f1ez, it seemed likely that Mexican tradition would not be treated as law. But when a restaurant has two words in its name and one of them is taco, you might think the star attraction will be a fat bundle of something hot and tasty folded inside a warm tortilla with a sauce that adds intrigue and excitement. That describes almost none of the tacos I ate at this jammed and noisy five-month-old restaurant inside the Pod 39 hotel in Murray Hill.\n        \n\n         The tortillas were a little bigger than an English muffin. A small taco can be a great taco, but these were topped so minimally and sauced so timidly that masa was virtually all I could taste. A swipe of curried crema was not enough to bring four tiny and stubbornly bland cauliflower florets to life. A relish of charred onions and pomegranate molasses might have lifted two little fried sweetbreads out of dullness if there had been more than a small blotch of it.\n        \n\n         Those tiny portions cooled quickly. Often the fillings were cold, the tortillas going stiff, a shame because they are freshly pressed and griddled. Even the miniature naan that stood in for a tortilla in one taco was so firm one day that it was unbendable, although on another it folded obediently around chunks of spiced lamb.\n        \n\n         Stacked in a covered basket, though, Salvation\u2019s masa tortillas are tender, warm and seductively fragrant. This is how they are served if you order one of the \u201cfamily-style feasts,\u201d impressive platters of protein that you tear apart and pile into tacos yourself. Two of these were spectacular: the ham hock, with a fruity and tart chile-tamarind glaze; and the cumin and pepper-rubbed lamb shoulder, so intensely flavorful it was as if three lambs had been distilled down to a single super-lamb.\n        \n\n         Rolling your own will get you a terrific taco, but some of the tables are so narrow it\u2019s a bit like performing surgery on an airplane seatback tray. Ken Friedman, Ms. Bloomfield\u2019s business partner in Salvation Taco (as well as the Spotted Pig, the\n         \n          John Dory\n         \n         Oyster Bar and\n         \n          the Breslin\n         \n         ), has gone for a psychedelic, polytheistic thrift-store look, filling two rooms with Japanese lanterns, glass Buddhas, Hindu gods, Christian saints and a painting of a cowboy angel by the Rev. Howard Finster. At least it supplied some visual distractions on a Friday night when a promised 90-minute wait for a table stretched to two hours.\n        \n\n         Dishes that seemed out of place in a taqueria often had a good reason for being there, including the fried pig ears sprinkled with ground chiles; a soup of kimchi, pork and hominy with the hot-and-sour potency of some Sichuan stews; and the dark, terrifically complex beef chili, long on the fruity flavor of dried chile peppers if somewhat short on meat.\n        \n\n         But the things you\u2019d hope any taqueria would nail could be dispiriting. Guacamole was sensationally well seasoned with lime and serranos, but always arrived cold. Margaritas were strangely flat, a mariachi band without trumpets. An al pastor quesadilla needed more heat, more cheese and, crucially, any amount of pineapple, which was missing entirely. At least two-thirds of the white cubes in a ceviche turned out to be not fish but apples.\n        \n\n         There is also a lamb tongue sandwich that the menu calls a torta. It had the bread you\u2019d expect, a bulkie roll dabbed with refried beans, but none of the trimmings: no lettuce, tomatoes, onions or mayonnaise. The tongue, poached and grilled, was wonderfully done, and so was the chimichurri of raw herbs, lime and olive oil. The only thing the sandwich needed was the crusty Italian roll that Ms. Bloomfield might have chosen if Salvation Taco was not supposed to be a Mexican restaurant.\n        \n\n         To redraw my taco baseline, I went to the Bronx. At Taqueria Tlaxcalli in the Parkchester neighborhood, I found golden gorditas, flying saucers of fried masa filled with a crunchy mash of chicharrones. These little pork puffs make impressively complex snacks with the addition of a cooked tomato salsa that had almost as much smoke as heat.\n        \n\n         I found hand-pinched sopes filled with refried beans and crumbled chorizo browned to a heavy-duty crackle that was softened by cilantro, onions, fresh cheese and crema.\n        \n\n         I found a crisp, citrusy and spicy cactus salad that was a model of unpretentious salad craftsmanship, and a torta constructed to maximize the collisions of warm and cool, crunchy and soft that are the source of the sandwich\u2019s charms.\n        \n\n         I found juicy fajitas and even juicier alambres, a stir-fry of meat, green peppers and onions under a poof of melted queso Oaxaca and four folded tortillas.\n        \n\n         And I found tacos that filled out their warm corn tortillas the way a fat man fills out a hammock. The meats were canonical: al pastor bright red with chiles and topped with pineapple; tender barbacoa to make a convert out of goat skeptics; and deeply savory carnitas that were somehow both creamy and crunchy.\n        \n\n         The exterior of Taqueria Tlaxcalli (pronounced TLOSH-collie), with a neon Corona sign under an awning in a shade of pink that looks like lipstick at the end of a long night, tells you to move on. The interior, with mango-colored walls, lime-green ceramic pitchers and marbled blue pendant lights, tells you to stay.\n        \n\n         You may be here for a while if you come during the dinner rush, when the cooks working at slapstick speed become mired in delivery orders. And some larger plates, like knife-resistant pounded steak in a thin guajillo sauce or the chicken enchiladas in a soupy and droningly bitter mole poblano, were not worth the delay.\n        \n\n         But the guacamole, freshly mashed in a molcajete, the traditional rough stone mortar, always appeared within minutes. Taqueria Tlaxcalli also makes a stew of cactus, onions and strips of chicken or steak in an angry red sauce or, my favorite, a tangy cooked tomatillo sauce. All versions are served, seething, inside a hot molcajete \u2014 the name of the stew.\n        \n\n         Mauricio G\u00f3mez founded Taqueria Tlaxcalli seven years ago because he was homesick for the food he had grown up with in Mexico City. For new immigrants, a little homesickness is to be expected, but a restaurant as solidly good as Mr. G\u00f3mez\u2019s is always a happy surprise.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 253, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-salvation-taco-in-murray-hill-and-taqueria-tlaxcalli-in-the-bronx.html", "google_mag": 23.5}, {"review_text": "\n            Before\n            \n             Jeju Noodle Bar\n            \n            came along in September, avid noodle watchers could have believed that\n            \n             the New York City ramen scene\n            \n            had reached a point of, if not saturation, at least diminishing returns.\n           \n\n            High-functioning Japanese chains such as\n            \n             E.A.K.\n            \n            ,\n            \n             Ichiran\n            \n            and\n            \n             Ippudo\n            \n            had established beachheads.\n            \n             Ivan Orkin\n            \n            ,\n            \n             Joshua Smookler\n            \n            and other chefs were having their way with the genre, following the trail of noodles left more than a decade ago by a young unknown named\n            \n             David Chang\n            \n            .\n            \n             Ramen tasting menus\n            \n            and\n            \n             ramen isolation booths\n            \n            were thriving along with stand-up and sit-down ramen counters. Appreciation for the finer points of tsukemen and mazemen, of seasoning shio and blending tare, had grown far beyond Japanese expatriates.\n           \n\n            But fresh wrinkles on the classics were growing rare, while new ramen-yas came along so fast it was getting hard to keep them straight. All that remained, it seemed, was to fill in the blank spaces on the map until bowls of tonkotsu and shoyu ramen were sold everywhere from Tottenville to Gun Hill Road.\n           \n\n            The one thing this view failed to take into account was the inspiration for Jeju Noodle Bar: Korean ramen.\n           \n\n            Yes, Koreans eat ramen. Oh, do they. Last year, South Korean\n            \n             domestic demand\n            \n            for ramyun, as it\u2019s known there, reached 1.16 billion pounds, a new high. We know the weight because almost all the ramyun made and eaten in South Korea is the instant variety. This reportedly also\n            \n             holds true in North Korea\n            \n            , where reliable sales figures are harder to come by.\n           \n\n            In other words, Jeju, in the West Village, is a tribute to a packaged convenience store item made up of a compressed brick of dried or fried noodles and an envelope of powdered or concentrated soup base. Often it is sold and mixed in a disposable cup.\n           \n\n            As important as ramyun is to the Korean diet, it is not the kind of culinary tradition that typically draws the attention of American chefs who have cooked at Per Se, Bouley and Chef\u2019s Table at Brooklyn Fare, as Douglas Kim did before founding Jeju. It is somewhat as if a cook had left\n            \n             L\u2019Astrance\n            \n            in Paris to open a restaurant specializing in\n            \n             interpretations of Hot Pockets\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            To judge from the three soups on Jeju\u2019s menu, Mr. Kim is not trying to reverse-engineer just-add-water Korean brands like\n            \n             Shin\n            \n            and\n            \n             Samyang\n            \n            . All of Jeju\u2019s broths have the body and texture that comes with boiling and skimming for hours over an abundance of meat and bones.\n           \n\n            One of them, the so ramyun, is made with veal. It is slightly less thick and rich than eggnog, but just as smooth. Mr. Kim ladles this broth over thin squiggles of chewy noodles, a hunk of stewed brisket and thin red sheets of raw Wagyu striated with white fat. Unbashful amounts of garlic chips and black pepper rough up the edges of the broth\u2019s gorgeously rounded beef flavor.\n           \n\n            The pork soup called gochu ramyun has a similarly lavish texture; heavy on the slippery collagen that holds pigs\u2019 feet together, it glides across your lips. This broth, though, is spicy, and the gochujang spooned over the seared pork belly slab on top makes it even more so. This is Mr. Kim\u2019s most obvious homage to Korean instant ramens,\n            \n             many of which are more fiery\n            \n            than the typical Japanese product. But Korean ingredients and seasonings turn up in all of his ramyuns. The gochu ramyun is garnished with daikon kimchi \u2014 not the pink, chili-bathed kind, but an unspiced white kimchi that, like the small sheaf of iceberg lettuce, provides a break from the heat.\n           \n\n            In contrast to the milky opacity of the veal and pork broths is the translucent, sparkling-gold chicken broth in a ramyun called the Fish Coop. The fish in question is bonito, flakes of which bring a mild background of seafood to the intense chicken flavor. Even with slices of jalape\u00f1o and a floating green rim of herb oil tasting of chives and dill, the broth is subtle enough that you can really taste the juicy shreds of chicken confit.\n           \n\n            Each of the three soups is so carefully considered, so well harmonized, that Jeju\u2019s menu really could end there. But Mr. Kim makes a handful of Korean-inspired appetizers, too, all more nuanced than what you\u2019d find in a typical ramen-ya.\n           \n\n            I love the cucumber kimchi, skinny little numbers whose soft tartness is almost bubbly and very slightly minty. Is there shiso in the brine? There\u2019s certainly plum in the sweet dressing dotted with black and white sesame seeds.\n           \n\n            Mr. Kim\u2019s soon du bu doesn\u2019t have the gloom-killing uppercut of more traditional recipes \u2014 it\u2019s a little too dainty and mild \u2014 but its tomato-shellfish broth supporting the usual soft tofu and some unorthodox but welcome green olives is very good on its own terms.\n           \n\n            One of three raw-fish appetizers is tuna yuk hwe in a pallid, forgettable dressing. But the amberjack salad with chimichurri and brown-butter vinaigrette is very delicious, as is the hwe dup bap \u2014 sashimi and trout roe over warm rice made extra-fishy by tiny black dots of flyingfish roe.\n           \n\n            There are a few other small dishes, including a likable steamed bun filled with pork belly and corn kernels. It will be interesting to see whether Mr. Kim elaborates this portion of the menu a bit, perhaps adding some larger plates. At the moment, it would be hard to make a complete meal at Jeju without ramyun, which may keep away people who don\u2019t eat meat.\n           \n\n            Like some other young chefs, Mr. Kim has brought his cooks into the tip pool by asking them to double as waiters. It may help him recruit talent for his kitchen, but it may also be a reason the service is muddled. I\u2019ve been served food meant for another table; I\u2019ve been asked the same question by two people within the space of a minute; I\u2019ve been given empty plates I didn\u2019t need, and had to stop somebody from clearing dishes I hadn\u2019t finished.\n           \n\n            The confusion even extended to the greeting at the door. One night when I got there before my guests, a host asked how far away everybody else was. I said I was sure they were close.\n           \n\n            \u201cWell, your reservation was at 8,\u201d was the reply. It was 8:03.\n           \n\n            These are minor gripes, but Mr. Kim\u2019s cooking deserves better. And so does the dining room, which is roomier and more elegant than the words \u201cnoodle bar\u201d might suggest. Jeju took over what used to be Nighthawks, in the space where the north side of Christopher Street meets the east side of Greenwich Street at an acute angle. It isn\u2019t\n            \n             the room Hopper painted\n            \n            , but it\u2019s not far off. Mr. Kim kept the wraparound windows, the black-and-white floor tiles and the recessed tin chandelier rosette, then added some backlighted shelves behind the bar to hold the handmade plates and other pottery.\n           \n\n            It is all clean and orderly, just bright enough that when you stand across the street you can see the new nighthawks bending over their bowls of noodles.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 254, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/dining/jeju-noodle-bar-review-korean-ramen.html", "google_mag": 34.5}, {"review_text": "\n         ONE school of criticism holds that chefs should faithfully honor any cuisine they pilfer.

It would suggest, at the very least, a straightforward tomato sauce in the Roman style.\n        \n\n         At Thirty Acres, which he opened in Jersey City last spring, Mr. Pemoulie has nothing of the sort in mind for his stolen gnocchi. They are bound for Eastern Europe. He has prepared a sauce of mustard and sour cream, and he will toss it with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and sauerkraut. He calls the dish \u201cgnocchi, pirogi style,\u201d and that is just what they taste like.\n        \n\n         Two traditions have been shamelessly looted for one plate, with deference to neither, and yet these Italian-Polish dumplings were more exciting than any number of earnest facsimiles. Creative stealing takes talent and nerve, and Mr. Pemoulie has both qualities in abundance.\n        \n\n         After nearly five years as chef de cuisine at\n         \n          Momofuku Noodle Bar\n         \n         , he could be expected to know his way around Asia. The Japanese spice blend togarashi seasoned a generous handful of tender braised chickpeas, all right, sharing the plate with a square of Arctic char. But Mr. Pemoulie had also swabbed the plate with a purple swoosh of roasted beets pur\u00e9ed with lemon juice, a sauce that was as simple and right as it was free of Asian leanings.\n        \n\n         To find a partner for a juicy, lightly smoky quail, Mr. Pemoulie went north for cranberries, then made a U-turn and headed south, cooking the berries into a spicy barbecue sauce that brought the all-American classic several extra layers of complexity.\n        \n\n         To a chef like Mr. Pemoulie, the map is merely a point of departure, an invitation to cross borders and jump oceans without leaving the kitchen. The rest of us can catch a ride as long as we\u2019re smart enough not to ask too many questions about where we\u2019re going.\n        \n\n         Thirty Acres challenges your sense of geography, starting with its location. Jersey City has not historically been the first place to look for innovative, serious-minded modern cooking. When\n         \n          Fran Schumer reviewed\n         \n         Thirty Acres in the Metropolitan section of The New York Times in June, she gave the restaurant her highest rating, \u201cDon\u2019t Miss,\u201d writing that it served \u201ca kind of cuisine I had never tasted in New Jersey.\u201d\n        \n\n         A restaurant like Thirty Acres would be a find in any state. It is the kind of place that can redraw regional boundaries, making the Hudson River no more of a barrier to eaters in search of inventive cooking than the East River has become in the past few years. For those who live near a PATH station, it may be easier to reach than several talked-about restaurants in Brooklyn.\n        \n\n         Mr. Pemoulie, who owns the restaurant with his wife, Alex, could do more to invite travelers, however. Reservations are not taken for parties of fewer than five, and there is a particularly unwelcoming wrinkle. If you have to wait for a table and there is no room at the bar, a host will take your phone number and point you toward some nearby saloons. But then she will tell you that if you don\u2019t pick up the phone, she will immediately move on to the next name on the list.\n        \n\n         If you\u2019ve ever missed a call while sitting inside a bar, this may strike you as inconsiderate at the least. Luckily, I passed the time enjoying the company of the high-spirited bartenders at a fusion place down the street called Sushi Tango, and my phone always rang.\n        \n\n         After walking down blocks of neat townhouses that reminded me of Brooklyn, I was always happy to head toward the lights streaming from the windows that wrap around Thirty Acres\u2019 corner spot on Jersey Avenue. The 32-seat dining room is simple and relatively unornamented, apart from the pastel portraits of Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford on corrugated cardboard.\n        \n\n         I don\u2019t know what brought the ex-presidents to Jersey City, but their benign presence seems to have rubbed off on the servers, who are unusually friendly and free of pretense, and on the amateur disc jockey who stocked the playlist with tunes like \u201cDon\u2019t Worry, Be Happy.\u201d\n        \n\n         The look of the menu is pure Momofuku, with its sans-serif font under boldface headings like \u201cThings\u201d and \u201cSweet Guys\u201d (desserts). Under \u201cRaw\u201d are two starters that give Mr. Pemoulie a chance to raid the larder of the Ashkenazi Jews, something he did frequently and successfully as fall changed to winter.\n        \n\n         A mash of beets with horseradish, last seen at\n         \n          Passover\n         \n         trying to make the best of its unfortunate marriage to gefilte fish, tries out a new partner at Thirty Acres, East Coast oysters on the half shell, liberated for the night from their unfortunate liaison with cocktail sauce. This was one time when infidelity brought out the best in both accomplices.\n        \n\n         Tasting cured belly of Arctic char sprinkled with sesame seeds and sea salt and accompanied by whipped scallion cream cheese, I could close my eyes and believe I was at a brunch catered by\n         \n          Russ & Daughters\n         \n         . The missing element, a bagel, wasn\u2019t missed at all; it would have gummed up the gently sweet slices of fish.\n        \n\n         We were still in Eastern Europe for a kind of pot roast of beef chuck under a shower of freshly grated horseradish and for braised cabbage wrapped around a cod fillet, although the Old Bay seasoning in the broth moved toward America again. The inspiration for a warm salad of spelt with sea urchin and triangles of Asian pear was harder to pinpoint, but I was taken aback by how well the earthy grains took to the sweet and briny urchin.\n        \n\n         After appetizers and main courses of such sophistication, Sweet Guys like apple crisp and lemon bars (from a recipe by Mr. Pemoulie\u2019s mother) can feel outclassed. Glassware, too, is a little too homey; the restaurant is B.Y.O.B., and if you\u2019ve picked up a good bottle or anything sparkling, you may wince to see it poured into a water tumbler.\n        \n\n         Both limitations probably stem from Mr. Pemoulie\u2019s attempt to work in a space that is not as big as his ambitions. Like many chefs these days, he had to take his opportunities where he could steal them.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 256, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-thirty-acres-in-jersey-city.html", "google_mag": 21.299999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n         Not long ago, the highest praise for a\n         \n\n\n          Brooklyn\n         \n         restaurant was \u201clike\n         \n\n\n          Manhattan\n         \n         .\u201d With\n         \n          Franny\u2019s\n         \n         , which opened in Prospect Heights in 2004, the geographical reference point started to shift west.\n        \n\n         Francine Stephens and Andrew Feinberg had worked in kitchens and dining rooms in Manhattan, but their restaurant borrowed some of its values from\n         \n\n\n          Northern California\n         \n         . Like Delfina in\n         \n\n\n          San Francisco\n         \n         and the cafe at Chez Panisse, Franny\u2019s served thin-crust pizzas topped with farmers\u2019 market produce and meats cured in the kitchen. In the spirit of the Bay Area, Franny\u2019s stood for food that was earnest, handmade, low-tech, unfussy and, of course, local-and-sustainable, pronounced as one word even then. (The back of Franny\u2019s menu told you who had grown everything on the pizzas and salads, and where.)\n        \n\n         Today, Brooklyn and\n         \n\n\n          Berkeley\n         \n         seem connected by an underground tunnel in which hybrid vehicles carry curing salts, butchery manuals and biodynamic wines back and forth below the continent. But at the time, nobody thought that West Coast sunshine was going to rescue the borough of brownstones and strollers from Manhattan\u2019s long shadow.\n        \n\n         A few months ago, Franny\u2019s moved across Flatbush Avenue to a bigger and busier space, with a second pizza oven and towers of takeout boxes by the bar. Maybe it was inevitable that as it grew, Franny\u2019s would feel less like a mom-and-pop mission and more like a business. In the churn and hustle, your pizza might show up with blisters of char the size of baseballs. Your beet salad might look a little more slapped-together than you remember from the early days. On the other hand, all those new tables mean you might start eating much sooner, because Franny\u2019s generally doesn\u2019t take reservations.\n        \n\n         Meanwhile, Ms. Stephens and Mr. Feinberg have converted the original Franny\u2019s into a new trattoria called\n         \n          Marco\u2019s\n         \n         . Some of the small-scale spirit survives next to a newfound maturity and comfort. The lights are gentler, the room more handsome, the tables less cramped. The places are set with dead-grandmother silverware. At the bar of radiantly white marble, you can raise a bittersweet Italian aperitif, on the rocks or folded into a cocktail, then move to the table you reserved by phone, without having to slide past some toddler\u2019s half-eaten pizza. It is among the most civilized first acts that dining in Brooklyn offers.\n        \n\n         The chef is Danny Amend, who fought in the trenches at Franny\u2019s for six years. On his menu, antipasti are followed by pastas that are succeeded by fish and meats. This sounds like\n         \n\n\n          Italy\n         \n         , but it tastes like Northern California. The\n         \n          late San Francisco chef Judy Rodgers\n         \n         may have thought up the casually Mediterranean and very charming fried egg, sunny-side up, crisscrossed with rosemary needles and sent out with roasted mushrooms and sweet, soft pumpkin.\n         \n          Paul Bertolli\n         \n         may have grilled the duck gizzards on a double-pronged skewer and served them with a jammy puddle of red grape must.\n        \n\n         There is a loose, Cal-Ital freedom to the way Mr. Amend spoons saffron-pickled fennel over oysters that have been rushed into and out of the wood oven. These oysters are hot and smoky, but still as fat and juicy as when they were raw. They come five to a plate. There were four of us. About two seconds later, I ordered more. Not only did I look like a genius to the other people at the table, but I got a second oyster.\n        \n\n         Smoke can be an invisible ingredient at Marco\u2019s. I couldn\u2019t always find it in the same dish from one week to the next, but it was always there in those oysters and gizzards, and on some nights it was there in three delicious main courses: the black sea bass that pulled apart into soft, glistening flakes; the spit-roasted pork loin with a crust of herbs; the lamb chops generously sharing their delicious pink juices with a bed of toast brushed with fresh dill. A lot of rustic Italian cooking in New York is either simple but dull, or flavorful but overworked. Mr. Amend has a knack, all too rare, of building flavor without appearing to go to much trouble about it.\n        \n\n         The worst moments at Franny\u2019s can arrive with the check, when you learn that pizza night with the kids had cost more than a week of groceries. It is a sneakily expensive pizzeria. Marco\u2019s is for the most part a reasonably priced trattoria, although the sense of value can come and go without warning. The pork loin was $21, and I took home enough for lunch the next day. For an exceptionally good braised chicken with a sticky pan sauce that clung to tender leaves of cabbage, $25 seemed completely fair. But for $21, a squid main course was smaller than many appetizers, and there were so few gigante beans on an $8 side dish that I counted them: 12 \u00bd.\n        \n\n         Mr. Amend also made a bowl of steamed Carolina gold rice that was sweetly nutty, lightly vinegared and unnaturally fluffy; it cost $7, and if he would have asked, I would have given him my credit card and let him charge whatever he wanted. It was almost satisfying enough to be grouped with the primi, an imposing bunch led by silky pockets of agnolotti filled with soft, warm fontina. Bucatini tossed with garlic, anchovy essence and walnuts was very good, although more finely chopped nuts would have had more flavor. The one pasta that let me down was slightly overcooked tagliatelle with prosciutto, a simple dish that didn\u2019t transcend its simplicity.\n        \n\n         Desserts have the lean Italian outlook sweetened with a little extra sugar: a wedge of polenta-buckwheat cake with fig preserves; soft crescents of quince poached in syrup; a light honey pudding with crumbly biscuit-like buckwheat cookies.\n        \n\n         Any time I left Franny\u2019s feeling as if my pocket had been picked, the wine list was a prime suspect. I\u2019d walk in thinking beer, and within five minutes I was drinking franciacorta. The list at Marco\u2019s is virtually all Italian and even more dangerous, especially if you are vulnerable to Piedmontese reds, but prices, in legal-disclaimer-size type on dark paper, are almost illegible without a flashlight app.\n        \n\n         Smart drinkers will ask for help, which was always close at hand. A manager gave me smart and enthusiastic wine guidance, but everyone working in Marco\u2019s dining room was poised, observant and informed. The level of service is like Manhattan. These days I probably need to add that I mean that as a compliment.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 258, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/18/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-marcos-in-prospect-heights.html", "google_mag": 22.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n         The first time I ate at Villard Michel Richard, the latest restaurant to dance among the frescoes and marble pilasters of the\n         \n          Villard mansion\n         \n         in Midtown, I strongly suspected that I was in an awful hotel restaurant.\n        \n\n         This seemed like a connect-the-dots conclusion. It\u2019s a restaurant. It\u2019s in a hotel, the New York Palace. And it was awful.\n        \n\n         That didn\u2019t make any sense, though. Born in\n         \n\n\n          Brittany\n         \n         but a star in the United States, trained in pastry but adept in every corner of the kitchen, Michel Richard has been one of the most respected chefs in this country since the 1980s. Settling in\n         \n\n\n          Washington\n         \n         , he gave the city a restaurant, Citronelle, that earned national fame. Michel Richard was serious. He would not have\n         \n          come to New York\n         \n         last fall to open an awful hotel restaurant.\n        \n\n         Other possibilities had to be considered. Hoping that I was wrong about the awfulness, I went back two more times, concentrating on the \u00e0 la carte menu served in the bistro on the Madison Avenue side of the restaurant rather than the tastings presented in a room named the Gallery, where dinner starts at $140 for four courses.\n        \n\n         The\n         \n\n\n          Stanford White\n         \n         interiors look better than they have in years, thanks to the attention the design firm Jeffrey Beers International paid to the way light strikes the paintings and fireplaces. White\u2019s giddily opulent Gilded Age rooms can awe out-of-town visitors. Two weeks before Christmas, the restaurant was full of little girls in fancy dresses, most of whom stared, hypnotized, into phones and tablets, although one young rebel held a doll in her lap.\n        \n\n         A glass cube in the center of the dining room shows off the wine stockpile amassed by\n         \n          Gilt\n         \n         , the last restaurant in this space. It\u2019s not too hard to get a wonderful and affordable bottle, but you may have to manage on your own. One night, when my table of three wanted a little Beaujolais, the sommelier tried to sell us a magnum. Another time, when I asked for help choosing among more than 80 German whites, a manager said apologetically that he didn\u2019t know much about them, and that the people who did weren\u2019t around.\n        \n\n         Still, I always ended up drinking well. And if everything had been on the level of the roasted chicken, the rustic bean soup and the salmon fillet on a bed of lentils energized with balsamic vinegar, Villard Michel Richard would easily qualify as an average hotel restaurant. But many other dishes vaulted across the gap that separates average from awful.\n        \n\n         Think of everything that\u2019s great about fried chicken. Now take it all away. In its place, right between dried-out strands of gray meat and a shell of fried bread crumbs, imagine a gummy white paste about a quarter-inch deep. This unidentifiable paste coats your mouth until you can\u2019t perceive textures or flavors. It is like edible Novocain.\n        \n\n         What Villard Michel Richard\u2019s $28 fried chicken does to Southern cooking, its $40 veal cheek blanquette does to French. A classic blanquette is a gentle, reassuring white stew of sublimely tender veal. In this version, the veal cheeks had the dense, rubbery consistency of overcooked liver. Slithering around the meat was a terrifying sauce the color of jarred turkey gravy mixed with cigar ashes. If soldiers had killed\n         \n          Escoffier\n         \n         \u2019s family in front of him and then forced him to make dinner, this is what he would have cooked.\n        \n\n         Yes, Villard Michel Richard is, in fact, an awful hotel restaurant. But it still didn\u2019t make any sense. Was Mr. Richard not the chef I had thought? Were the ecstatic reviews, the five awards from the James Beard Foundation, the induction into the Ma\u00eetres Cuisiniers de\n         \n\n\n          France\n         \n         , all a mass delusion?\n        \n\n         I doubted that, but to make sure I had dinner at\n         \n          Central Michel Richard\n         \n         , a bright, loud French-American bistro that opened in Washington in 2007. (Citronelle has been closed since 2012.) If a dish was served in both cities, I ordered it. In every case, the Washington version looked and tasted better, for the same price or less.\n        \n\n         Mr. Richard makes a chicken-liver mousse he calls faux gras, and at Central it was so silky and rich that the pun was not much of a stretch. The one in New York wouldn\u2019t be mistaken for anything but mediocre chicken liver.\n        \n\n         Lobster bisque in Washington had a robust shellfish intensity. The Villard version was floury, pale and almost completely bland; you could get nearly as much flavor by putting a lobster bib into a juicer.\n        \n\n         A fris\u00e9e salad at Central was garnished with crunchy little croutons, freshly crisped bacon matchsticks and a warm poached egg. At Villard, the croutons were stale, the bacon limp and the egg cold.\n        \n\n         The strangest thing about my dinner at Central was the fried chicken. It looked like the one at Villard, but it was terrific. The difference between them was like the difference between winning a medal for figure skating and falling through the ice.\n        \n\n         Mr. Richard was so clearly a smart, accomplished chef that for one crazy moment, I wondered if Villard Michel Richard was bad on purpose. Maybe he was paying tribute to the awful hotel food of years past, the way Grant Achatz and Dave Beran of\n         \n          the restaurant Next\n         \n         are paying homage to\n         \n\n\n          Chicago\n         \n         \u2019s steakhouse tradition.\n        \n\n         The seafood pasta, after all, is almost a direct quote from the 1980s, when doughy, gluey, overcooked fresh pasta and washed-out bits of unidentifiable seafood drooped in flavorless pink sauces. Of the same vintage, and just as bizarre, were the mushrooms under a tower of puff pastry ringed with cold, mud-colored sauce that tasted of uncooked wine. (If Villard Michel Richard doesn\u2019t make it as a restaurant, it could reopen as the Museum of Unappetizing Brown Sauces.)\n        \n\n         The flaw with this hypothesis was the desserts. They broke character. Mr. Richard\u2019s elegant, reverse-engineered Kit Kat bar; his rectangle of classic cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e with mango sauce; his profiteroles in the style of a croquembouche, with a steeple of puff pastry spheres enclosing the ice cream and a pitcher of warm chocolate sauce to be poured over the top: They were all too good to be a joke. The girls in dresses even put down their phones for the celebration cake, a chocolate drum that shoots out sparks and, when you break it open, reveals a jumble of fruit and spongecake.\n        \n\n         There was another possibility: Perhaps the restaurant was awful because Mr. Richard wasn\u2019t actually involved. It\u2019s true that he is not the owner, but neither does he have the kind of licensing and consulting deal that has often made the names of\n         \n\n\n          Gordon Ramsay\n         \n         or Todd English little more than celebrity endorsements. He is a partner, a publicist said, sharing in profits and overseeing \u201cday-to-day operations.\u201d A union contract limits his ability to hire and fire cooks, but that didn\u2019t keep\n         \n          Paul Liebrandt\n         \n         and Justin Bogle from pulling off formidable technical feats when they ruled this kitchen.\n        \n\n         There is one more theory. Villard Michel Richard may be a symptom of the deal-making culture that afflicts the restaurant business. Too many chefs are being tempted with too many offers from too many developers and investors. Hotels especially know that a famous name lures travelers, who won\u2019t realize until it\u2019s too late that the food being served has nothing in common with the cooking that made the name famous.\n        \n\n         Opening a restaurant used to be a brutal process, and for many chefs it still is. If you\u2019ve spent your own money and borrowed from your friends and family, you\u2019re too scared to slack off. But the best-known chefs don\u2019t have to worry about this anymore. It\u2019s become much easier for them to open restaurants. Maybe it\u2019s too easy, because running one is still as hard as ever.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 259, "rating": "Fair", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/15/dining/restaurant-review-the-bistro-at-villard-michel-richard-in-midtown.html", "google_mag": 37.20000076293945}, {"review_text": "\n         Someone who used to prowl around\n         \n\n\n          CBGB\n         \n         and other clubs when punk and new wave were breaking their first guitar strings told me he had seen one particularly untutored band at least 30 times.\n        \n\n         \u201cReally?\u201d I asked. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first 15 times, they were just awful.\u201d\n        \n\n         I didn\u2019t need to ask why he had stuck it out because the band was Television, and they went on to harness their early chaos into two obliquely beautiful records.\n        \n\n         Some restaurants are like that.

That night, the Pines and its chef, Angelo Romano, were in control of their chords and the tempo from start to finish. Dinner began with a short glass of chilled soup, or maybe it was a virgin cocktail: tofu whipped with mint into a frothy green drink. Lolling at the bottom were juicy little Champagne grapes, a burst of sweetness lightening the intensity of the mint.\n        \n\n         Next was a salad. Wheels of yellow cucumber had been marinated with a yuzu green-chile paste to give them a citric tang and a low burn. They were set beside a pool of almond milk and stacked with thin medallions of more almond milk, this batch thickened to the texture of silken tofu.\n        \n\n         It was very good, and the next course was simply great: razor clams and trout roe with pinched squares of fresh pasta that Mr. Romano calls borsa vuota, or empty purses. The pasta seemed undercooked and under-clammed until I gave it a stir, sending the purses down to soften in the spicy miso-butter sauce, and bringing up a dividend of extra shellfish and slices of tiny hot red chiles.\n        \n\n         There had been flashes of excellence before that night, but they had been obscured by hospitality issues, strange kitchen decisions and checks whose totals had a way of ambushing me.\n        \n\n         The Pines, about a five-minute walk from the Gowanus Canal past windowless industrial buildings and stubby little houses, looks like an indie band sounds. Beat-up pressed tin ceilings have been nailed across some patches of wall, and others are covered in bare wood slats. Spooky dried flowers and herbs hang over the bar, evoking not a Tuscan farmhouse but an abandoned cabin being used for Wiccan rituals.\n        \n\n         Next to the kitchen is a signboard with cryptic handlettered slogans: Fugazi. Rainbows and Unicorns. Pray 4 Weezy. Beards: They Grow on You.\n        \n\n         Despite the untucked appearance of the Pines, it is surprisingly easy to spend what you would in a slick\n         \n\n\n          Manhattan\n         \n         restaurant. One night I\u2019d rolled in like a drug dealer, hundreds of dollars stuffed in my pocket because I knew the Pines didn\u2019t take credit cards. Service was vague and distant. We waited interminably for food, cocktails, even glasses of wine. To settle the check at the end of a long, slow night, I needed about $100 more than I had brought.\n        \n\n         I knew from the Web site that there was an A.T.M. in the restaurant. It was broken.\n        \n\n         Lots of businesses are opening on Third Avenue around President Street, but the area is not yet one of the world\u2019s banking capitals. After a 10-minute search on foot, I got into my car and drove until I found a cash machine.\n        \n\n         On other nights, the food was perplexing. Mr. Romano, who cooked at\n         \n          Roberta\u2019s\n         \n         before striking out on his own at a short-lived Williamsburg restaurant called\n         \n          Masten Lake\n         \n         , has a discerning eye for prime ingredients, but isn\u2019t always as discerning about his ideas.\n        \n\n         Cappellacci that looked like bishop\u2019s miters were filled with a giddily tender and rich oxtail rag\u00f9, but the pasta was as thick as shoe box cardboard and nearly as stiff. The cappellacci were undercooked at other meals, too; apparently it\u2019s a feature.\n        \n\n         Coating sea urchin with crunchy BBs of toasted amaranth grains and serving it with tart, astringent sea buckthorn juice struck me as a mean thing to do to a nice, gentle ingredient.\n        \n\n         Most memorable was the squab \u2014 dry-aged and roasted with its feet on \u2014 that made the bird look as if it were running. It may have been running away from the oven, because one breast was still bloody.\n        \n\n         The raw-pigeon incident nearly ended my fascination with the Pines. Luckily, though, I remembered eating other things that were distinctive and skillfully prepared. On recent visits, such dishes have become the rule, not the exception.\n        \n\n         In the spring, Mr. Romano made the smart decision to treat ramp greens like spinach, saut\u00e9ing them to softness and surrounding them with a concentrated tart-sweet late-harvest vinegar. A fried duck egg and Marcona almonds balanced their garlicky bitterness.\n        \n\n         This summer, he dressed tender young purslane with a vibrant emulsion of mint and garlic. A savory foam of warmed egg yolks had been shot between the purslane branches, a lovely way of adding creaminess to the crisp greens.\n        \n\n         Mr. Romano is fond of esoteric ingredients like sea blight and Japanese knotweed, but he can wring terrific results out of more-common ones. Lightly cooked corn juice under slices of roasted pork shoulder offered profound, summery pleasure, and cabbage cooked with fish sauce, sambal and smoked pork jowl layered Asian flavors in an unexpected and very welcome way. And his choice of melted aged beef fat with chunks of bone marrow as a sauce doubled down on the beefy intensity of a Wagyu culotte steak.\n        \n\n         As my meals have been getting better, the restaurant has been growing up. The no-reservations policy was dropped. The service has become more polished and knowledgeable, ready to tell you what that glass of Slovenian refosco or other wines on Mr. Romano\u2019s willfully obscure list will taste like.\n        \n\n         And as of last week, the Pines accepts some credit cards. These civilities make it easier to take a chance on a night that costs a bit more than the cover charge and a beer at CBGB in 1975.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 260, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/21/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-the-pines-in-brooklyn.html", "google_mag": 26.899999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n         Disco music with raw fish in the East Village may not strike you as a winning formula unless you remember when Avenue A had what was probably the only sushi bar in the city with a mirror ball and a D.J. booth. Everybody called it Disco Sushi, and I loved it for reasons that had nothing to do with the food. I had eaten enough good sushi to know I couldn\u2019t afford it. But cold rice, fake wasabi and sinewy fish mattered much less when vinyl records and the mirror ball were spinning, the tables were filling up with musicians waiting for a 1 a.m. gig at Brownies, and we were all on our third round of sake bombs.\n        \n\n         I didn\u2019t realize how much I missed Disco Sushi until I found Sushi Dojo, which opened this summer on First Avenue near East Sixth Street. There were no turntables in sight, but the room was filled with retro disco. Usually, bone-thumping dance music is the way restaurants say \u201cwe hate you\u201d to their customers. But at Sushi Dojo the tracks by Chromeo, Sare Havlicek and the like were played at a humane volume and compiled with an evident love for high-sheen, poppy neo-disco.\n        \n\n         And while I didn\u2019t spot any sake bombs, plenty of people were getting bombed on sake. Ask the sommelier, Max Lidukhover, for a recommendation and he\u2019ll give you two samples that would pass for full pours in other places, and if you\u2019re not wild about either, he\u2019s likely to uncork a third. Along the way he\u2019ll teach you the basics.\n        \n\n         \u201cGinjo sake is very harsh,\u201d he\u2019ll say. \u201cI don\u2019t recommend it unless you\u2019re looking to get wasted.\u201d\n        \n\n         This is not necessarily discouraged at Sushi Dojo, where you can see customers in lip locks, customers waving their arms in full I-love-you-guys mode and customers buying rounds for the chefs, a Japanese custom that the staff avidly embraces.\n        \n\n         All this would earn Sushi Dojo a heartfelt welcome to the neighborhood even if the food didn\u2019t stand out. But it does. The soul of this party is sushi worth getting crazy for, made by three chefs with a strong traditional bent: Hiromi Suzuki, Makoto Yoshizawa and David Bouhadana. Mr. Bouhadana is\n         \n          the ringleader\n         \n         , and the most exuberant customers seem to gravitate to his end of the counter.\n        \n\n         One night I asked Ms. Suzuki for $75 worth of sashimi and sushi, dealer\u2019s choice. Sashimi came first: entwined bands of unshy, oily horse mackerel under a stubble of chives; firm white squares of local striped bass; shiny sunset-pink\n         \n\n\n          Arctic\n         \n         char jolted with lemon; bonito seared by a pass of the blowtorch; a slippery-soft tongue of raw spotted prawn next to its armored head.\n        \n\n         The streaks of fresh wasabi I drew with a chopstick tip underscored what Ms. Suzuki had already done with her knives, her torch and her seasonings to enhance the texture and taste of each kind of sashimi. Next, she placed one matchbox-size piece of sushi at a time on a banana leaf: glistening golden-eye snapper; a purplish strip of needlefish with skin that flashed like steel; yellowtail belly that melted like whipped lard; wild Alaskan salmon warmed by Ms. Suzuki\u2019s blowtorch just long enough to melt some of the oils; and a delicate slip of sea eel, one of the finest I\u2019ve found anywhere.\n        \n\n         This was more than raw seafood; it was the work of a thinking chef, and it was a treat. It was also a lot of high-quality fish for the price. If $75 is beyond your means, an entry-level 10-piece omakase sushi meal costs just $45, although it probably won\u2019t include many seasonal specialties like needlefish or rarities like live, still-wriggling octopus.\n        \n\n         Not every piece I had at Sushi Dojo was exceptional; baby cuttlefish refused to surrender its flavor, and I wasn\u2019t sure if a scallop, overpowered by wasabi, had much to hold on to. The rice can wad together stubbornly rather than falling into separate grains, too. But its gently vinegared seasoning blooms in the mouth, lifting up the taste of fish.\n        \n\n         There is a surprisingly long menu of cooked food, and while it doesn\u2019t quite keep pace with the sushi, it\u2019s more than respectable. If this kitchen fried it, you want it: shrimp in their crackling shells; a beehive of mizuna and seafood tempura with green-tea salt; a horse mackerel\u2019s skeleton, dispatched to hot oil after you\u2019ve eaten its body as sashimi.\n        \n\n         Kurumazushi is where I would have gone in my Disco Sushi days if I\u2019d been able to afford it.\n         \n\n\n          Ruth Reichl\n         \n\n          gave it three stars\n         \n         in its last review in\n         \n\n\n          The New York Times\n         \n         , in 1995. At the time, many sushi hounds regarded it as the best in the city. Some still do, but I am not one of them.\n        \n\n         My meals in this restaurant, hidden on the second floor of a small Midtown office building that, like one of the artist\n         \n          Ben Katchor\n         \n         \u2019s streetscapes, has sidestepped the modern age, offered some extraordinary tastes: king crab from\n         \n\n\n          Canada\n         \n         ; very sweet squid made tender by a fine lattice of crosshatched cuts; gleaming amberjack and horse mackerel; and a hand roll of fatty tuna and scallions that made me forget how to speak for a minute or two.\n        \n\n         But an omakase meal that starts at $300 should make you fall silent more than once or twice. Some of the sushi might have come from a far less exalted restaurant: the eel drenched in sugary sauce, the forgettable salmon roe, and an array of seafood that would have had no character at all if not for the dab of fresh wasabi. The fish was too cold, a particular issue with fattier cuts like toro. The main culprit, though, was rice, a mass of starch so in need of seasoning that it erased the flavors of the fish like blotting paper.\n        \n\n         And while the wasabi on sushi was the real thing, the green stuff on a sashimi plate, one course in a $140 prix fixe meal I ate in the front dining room, was not.\n        \n\n         That room is a cheerless place, and lacks Kurumazushi\u2019s greatest asset: Toshihiro Uezu, the chef. An antic, grinning presence, Mr. Uezu has as much fun as anyone in the restaurant. Standing between the sushi counter and a wall that looks like a raked sand garden in\n         \n\n\n          Japan\n         \n         , he slams metal trays of fish on top of one another, catches his breath, and turns to a customer: \u201cO.K.! Sushi or sashimi? You choose or I choose?\u201d And then he is off. \u201cHorse mackerel,\u201d he says, reaching across the counter with a length of pinkish fish draped over rice.\n        \n\n         \u201cHorse?\u201d a customer asks, unsure he\u2019d heard it right. Mr. Uezu loves this. \u201cYes! Horse!\u201d he says. \u201cSecretariat!\u201d He laughs. Everybody laughs. Just like that, it\u2019s a sushi party.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 261, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-sushi-dojo-in-the-east-village-and-kurumazushi-in-midtown.html", "google_mag": 25.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n         When a restaurant is founded by a chef whose kitchen acrobatics make us sit up and notice, it can be confusing for everybody when that chef moves on. Will the replacement be a caretaker cook mimicking the style that made the place exciting? Or will the successor be a creative whiz who can make the menu jump through a new set of hoops?\n        \n\n         A Voce Madison and BLT Fish, two\n         \n\n\n          Manhattan\n         \n         restaurants that won enthusiastic three-star reviews from Frank Bruni in\n         \n\n\n          The New York Times\n         \n         shortly after they opened, have faced this question. Laurent Tourondel whipped up\n         \n          BLT Fish\n         \n         in 2005, but walked away from it and his other BLT restaurants around the country four years later in\n         \n          a messy split\n         \n         with his business partner.\n         \n          Andrew Carmellini\n         \n         put A Voce,\n         \n          as it was called then\n         \n         , on the map in 2006, but he is long gone, too.\n        \n\n         The two restaurants didn\u2019t capsize after their captains jumped ship, but some of the wind has gone out of their sails. The companies that own both restaurants are not run by chefs, which may explain why they have hired successors from outside; neither organization has the deep bench of up-and-coming cooks that a\n         \n\n\n          Daniel Boulud\n         \n         or a\n         \n\n\n          Mario Batali\n         \n         can draw on.\n        \n\n         A Voce Madison is on its third chef. Mr. Carmellini was succeeded by Missy Robbins, who also opened the sister A Voce in the\n         \n\n\n          Time Warner\n         \n         Center. At the original, off Madison Square, she was replaced last summer by Ben Lee. Mr. Lee is an assured cook who earned his stripes working for Marc Vetri and\n         \n          Michael White\n         \n         , and under his watch the kitchen at A Voce Madison has taken an understated turn that still offers a rewarding interpretation of modern Italian cuisine.\n        \n\n         He exerts a fine-tuned control on brawny, rustic flavors, setting octopus stewed in red wine on a savory semolina pancake with a thick ridge of concentrated tomato sauce and browned crumbles of\n         \n          fiery \u2018nduja\n         \n         . He has a five-minute egg on toast that sounds like a desperation dinner scavenged from an empty refrigerator, but as the liquid yolk coats lightly pickled hen-of-the-woods mushrooms under a nutty Parmigiano-Reggiano cream, it turns out to be a very elegant appetizer.\n        \n\n         There was an echo of Mr. White\u2019s silky way with pasta in the fettuccine tossed with a meaty braise of rabbit with rosemary and black trumpet mushrooms, and in the tender yellow packets of agnolotti filled with lovely lemon-scented ricotta.\n        \n\n         Other pastas lacked a sense of proportion, like the buckwheat pizzoccheri that needed more than a few stray leaves of chard to balance the gooey slick of melted bitto cheese. And one was just strange: the cassoncini, pale fried ravioli with a filling of mozzarella, anchovy and sundried tomatoes that tasted like pizza run through a blender.\n        \n\n         In the main courses, Mr. Lee shows more nuance with seafood than with meat. A hulking braised lamb shank in midwinter was more blunt than focused, while a lukewarm pork chop that was probably never going to get off the ground didn\u2019t get much aerodynamic lift from the mushy, oily mass of pine nuts and raisins on top. He brought more finesse to wild striped bass with fennel braised in orange juice, and to satiny olive-oil poached cod with sweet littlenecks.\n        \n\n         A new pastry chef, Kristin\n         \n\n\n          Menton\n         \n         , is making desserts that are as charming as a handwritten thank-you note. A honey-lavender panna cotta with fresh peaches and peach sorbet had an understated hum of sweetness, and extracted a gentle perfume from the lavender without giving in to potpourri overkill.\n        \n\n         Service has been variable \u2014 so lethargic one night that it must have added an hour to the meal, almost pushy on another, when a server loomed over the table with a grappa bottle the size of a softball bat. \u201cThey make it for us. It\u2019s very nice,\u201d she said. We showed no interest, but still: \u201cYou want to try?\u201d This time we said no. \u201cJust a little bit?\u201d At least she didn\u2019t start swinging the bottle at us.\n        \n\n         When Mr. Carmellini ran the shop, the food felt imperative, almost insisting that you give in to its full-flavored seductions.\n        \n\n         Mr. Lee\u2019s style doesn\u2019t have the same strong personal imprint, but he has kept A Voce Madison among the city\u2019s more enjoyable practitioners of contemporary Italian cuisine.\n        \n\n         BLT Fish, in Chelsea, was always a trickier proposition. The engine that drove its initial success was the tension between Laurent Tourondel\u2019s sophisticated French technique and the crowd-pleasing trinkets he tossed out like Mardi Gras beads. (A meal might kick off with fried rock shrimp in\n         \n\n\n          Buffalo\n         \n         wing sauce and blue cheese.) The restaurant was serious and fun at the same time, \u201cthe culinary equivalent of a poetic page-turner or a mass-market movie helmed by an auteur,\u201d as Mr. Bruni put it.\n        \n\n         With the poet and auteur subtracted, the formula grew creaky. Last spring, the owners brought on a new chef, Luke Venner. Most recently the chef de cuisine at\n         \n          Millwright\u2019s\n         \n         in Simsbury, Conn., Mr. Venner seems miscast here. He doesn\u2019t hit the high notes as effortlessly as Mr. Tourondel did, so the populist touches don\u2019t feel witty and self-aware anymore. They just feel like gimmicks.\n        \n\n         Often enough, the kitchen outfits seafood in flattering ways. Very sweet raw scallops were minimally but effectively dressed with lemon oil and thyme leaves. Spaghetti in a parsley-cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche sauce flickering with red Thai chiles provided a bright setting for sliced razor clams. Ham-hock broth, white polenta and sweet spring peas made for a winning version of shrimp and grits. Lightly charred octopus was served on briny, intense black olive pur\u00e9e above a bed of potatoes, which came together as a combined condiment and side dish.\n        \n\n         But there are also sauces that don\u2019t click, like the washed-out mandarin emulsion with halibut, or the dashi broth with scallops and nine kinds of mushrooms, which proved that more umami is not always the answer. There are odd pairings, like the curried oxtail stew served with smooth shrimp that refused to cling to the sauce. There is inattention to detail, like the crunchy, gritty morels in a thin, salty asparagus soup, or the branzino left to bake inside its salt crust until it was slightly dry and tough.\n        \n\n         The prices at BLT Fish, never gentle, are hard to support now that the food is uneven. The branzino, meant for two, cost $68. A $70 seafood platter offered bland, not very tender lobster tail; undercooked mussels with their beards left intact, and big, rubbery shrimp. It held some very good tastes, too, but they delivered about $35 worth of pleasure, rounding up.\n        \n\n         Desserts are a mixed lot as well, but the first choice should be the excellent tarte Tatin, baked in a little cast iron pot with a thick swirl of caramel. While you\u2019re eating it, a glass jar of cotton candy arrives. In the beginning, this circus flourish was like a wink from a chef with the heart of a carnival ringmaster. Now it\u2019s one of the few claims BLT Fish has to being more than another expensive place to eat seafood.\n        \n\n\n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 262, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/18/dining/restaurant-review-a-voce-madison-and-blt-fish.html", "google_mag": 29.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n         You can count on one hand the chefs in New York who serve bluefish. Narrow the list to those with the confidence to serve it raw, and you\u2019re probably down to one finger and one name: Dave Pasternack.\n        \n\n         The\n         \n          challenges of bluefish\n         \n         are formidable. If it isn\u2019t iced right after it\u2019s hooked, if it isn\u2019t killed and chilled properly, if too much time goes by before it arrives at the table, bluefish has a habit of tasting and smelling like discount cat food. Its flavor is strong but its flesh is soft, and when it is raw, a dull, unsteady knife can reduce it to a bruise-colored pulp.\n        \n\n         Of course I had to have it when I spotted it under the crudo section of the\n         \n          menu at Barchetta\n         \n         , which Mr. Pasternack opened in Chelsea in April. And of course it was immaculate: firm slabs of bluefish, standing at attention on a cold plate with olive oil, a few drops of lemon juice and inky green shreds of caper leaves. The rich oils melted while I chewed, and I was convinced that this particular specimen must have been slashing through the Atlantic while I had been brewing that morning\u2019s coffee.\n        \n\n         In 14 years as the chef at\n         \n          Esca\n         \n         , Mr. Pasternack has proved to be one of the city\u2019s most resourceful and skillful seafood cooks. It goes without saying that Barchetta, where Mr. Pasternack\u2019s partner is John Meadow and his chef de cuisine is Christian Goerner, is a seafood restaurant. It is a very good one at times, but not at all times. There were encouraging nights, including the one that started with raw bluefish, when I was sure that Barchetta would become one of the first places I\u2019d send people who really love the taste of fish. And there was one when it seemed mired among all the also-rans.\n        \n\n         Inconsistency in a seafood restaurant presents a quandary. Great ones are rare enough that seafood lovers will feel a strong tug to check out\n         \n          Barchetta\n         \n         and hope for the best, but they\u2019ll also be tempted to stay away out of fear that they\u2019ll hit it on an off night. This is not a problem that plagues diners who simply want a grilled pork chop. Fish cooking tends to be an all-or-nothing game, though. An extra day between the ocean and the table or an extra minute in the saut\u00e9 pan can mean the difference between a memorable dinner and a wasted evening. The chefs who understand the factors that make that difference, and can navigate them, are in shorter supply than bluefin tuna.\n        \n\n         I knew I was in the hands of one of those chefs on my first and second meals at Barchetta. Monkfish liver was treated like foie gras, darkly seared on the outside but as wobbly as pudding within. On the side were figs roasted into a jam-jar sweetness. The idea was both obvious and inspired.\n        \n\n         The crudi were just the way I remembered them from Esca. Each fish was carved with a sushi chef\u2019s sensitivity to fish anatomy, then given only as much added flavor as it could handle. To bring out the minerality and sweetness of pink snapper, there were plum-red grains of sea salt blended with\n         \n\n\n          Long Island\n         \n         merlot. Subtle, supple halibut belly was splashed with sunflower oil that was so mild it almost wasn\u2019t there. Golden spotted bass, slightly more forceful, was given a light application of olive oil and lemon, while bluefish got a similar treatment but in the stronger dose that it needed.\n        \n\n         Main courses like wonderfully rich grilled kingfish steak, a roasted whole black sea bass and a bread-crumb-crusted hunk of pumpkin swordfish were pulled from the heat precisely at the moment their thickest sections had firmed, before they had a chance to seize up into a tough fist that would chase away their sweet oceanic juices.\n        \n\n         On the night when the kitchen seemed to fall behind the beat, though, the skin on a grilled Spanish mackerel was too severely charred and the flesh had been heated a few degrees beyond the ideal. Toasted cracked hazelnuts and orange sections helped make up for it, and the dish wouldn\u2019t have raised eyebrows in most other restaurants, but it lacked the finesse that I knew by then Barchetta is capable of. A handsome, thick cut of cobia had been left on the grill until it had the first signs of squeaky overdoneness and the grate had burned the bread-crumb coating. Raw blackfish dotted with pine-bud syrup was tougher than the crudi had been on other nights. Some greens in a relentlessly dull salad were showing their age. A bowl of pasta with mullet bottarga was swimming in olive oil that took the crunch right out of the toasted bread crumbs.\n        \n\n         A few excellent dishes surfaced from the murk, like the gently fried spearing and the appetizer of velvety marinated herring with raisins and cauliflower. The evening\u2019s most memorable dish was a grilled lamb porterhouse, though, which says less about the lamb than about the kitchen\u2019s struggles landing its catch.\n        \n\n         When dinner is less than transfixing, you have time to notice how incoherent Barchetta\u2019s dining room is. Gone are the nightclub intimacy of\n         \n          Bette\n         \n         and the Riviera sparkle of Bistro La Promenade, the last two tenants. In their place is a mishmash of ideas: old nautical flags hanging beside new art from Chelsea galleries; Danish modern chairs mixed with tan simulated leather banquettes that would suit a Midtown coffee shop.\n        \n\n         On good nights, you\u2019re more likely to notice how thoughtful the service is. Setting the tone is the outstanding rosemary focaccia that shows up while you\u2019re still scanning the menu. Assistance with the wine list, about half Italian and priced to sell, is quick to arrive, too, and unusually perceptive. The general manager and wine director, George Hock, always seemed to know what my table wanted, translating a few vague adjectives and a not-so-vague price limit into a bottle that was just what we were looking for and then some.\n        \n\n         At a fairly casual restaurant like Barchetta, wine service of this caliber is a gift. The total check, of course, is no gift, but it is very fair for fish at a place that never stoops to flabby farmed salmon. Barchetta could still turn out to be the seafood restaurant that downtown needs. If a nautical flag were flying over Barchetta\u2019s door on West 23rd Street, it would be the one that means \u201cProceed, but exercise caution.\u201d\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 263, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/dining/restaurant-review-barchetta-in-chelsea.html", "google_mag": 24.200000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n         You can\u2019t get mad at a macaron, but with all due respect I\u2019d suggest that there are other French ideas about eating that would benefit New York more than balloon-weight sandwich cookies in sidewalk-chalk colors. We could, for instance, use a few wine bars of the type that began sprouting around\n         \n\n\n          Paris\n         \n         about a decade ago.\n        \n\n         Like traditional bars \u00e0 vins, they have closely considered wine lists whose length and prices are geared for the curious drinker, but they championed winemaking\u2019s noninterventionist avant-garde before that was the thing to do. They also flicked the dust off the traditional menu of ready-to-go standbys like hams, cheeses, terrines and open-face sandwiches. Sure, there is excellent charcuterie, but there is some cooking, too, and it betrays care and originality. For the chefs of small restaurants like Septime and\n         \n          Frenchie\n         \n         that are full nearly every night, the wine bar next door has become the preferred way to expand.\n        \n\n\n          Racines\n         \n         , which the chef Pierre Jancou opened in 2007 under the glass roof of a 19th-century shopping arcade on the Boulevard Montmartre, was an early example of this breed and one of the most militant. It poured only wines made without sulfur, which even most purists admit can keep good bottles from going bad. Mr. Jancou was a believer, and he could be intolerant of those who didn\u2019t share the faith. If you thought one of his wines smelled like a running shoe filled with Gorgonzola, fine. You could go elsewhere and drink\n         \n\n\n          Bordeaux\n         \n         with the rest of the heathens.\n        \n\n         If not for the name, you would never guess that Racines NY, which appeared in TriBeCa this spring, is any relation. It\u2019s three times the size of the 20-seat original. The service is solicitous. The sommelier, Arnaud Tronche, genuinely appears to care whether people like what they\u2019re drinking. Sulfur, in minimal doses, is tolerated. This being New York, prices at the low end of the long, mostly French list aren\u2019t as low. And although wine will be the main event for many people, Racines NY is not a wine bar. It\u2019s a restaurant \u2014 or \u201cneo-bistro,\u201d in the words of the owners: Mr. Tronche; David Lillie, a partner in\n         \n          Chambers Street Wines,\n         \n         down the street; and David Lanher, who bought the first Racines from Mr. Jancou in 2009.\n        \n\n         In other words, the menu is meant for dining, not snacking. Nor for sharing, either, although my attempt to keep my fork out of my wife\u2019s plateful of whole, warm\n         \n\n\n          Oregon\n         \n         morels on a pool of half-liquid burrata failed miserably.\n        \n\n         For the most part, the chef Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Duca\u2019s appetizers are opening moves, and very elegant ones. Mr. Duca served a length of barely seared wild salmon, the raw flesh inside the intense orange-red of a persimmon, with a scoop of cucumber sorbet and a schmear of warm cauliflower cream. These are two of the mildest vegetables in existence, so combining them would not seem like a formula for excitement, but it was like watching summer and winter meet for the first time.\n        \n\n         Raw veal with warm mayonnaise probably doesn\u2019t sound like a bell-ringer, either. But with pine nuts and tarragon folded into cubes of meat, it made a delicious tartare, unorthodox but unmistakably French.\n        \n\n         Mr. Duca, who grew up near\n         \n\n\n          Marseille\n         \n         , had begun to win recognition as the chef of L\u2019Instant d\u2019Or, in Paris, when Mr. Lanher talked him into moving to Chambers Street. Transplanted chefs often need time to find the right suppliers. But almost every ingredient I tasted at Racines NY was fresh and swimming with flavor. If you haven\u2019t fully wallowed in berry season yet, go and get the full, dark-red strawberries layered over basil panna cotta. It\u2019s currently the star dessert, outclassing a tart of chocolate and salt caramel that comes across as a knockoff (though as knockoffs go, it\u2019s very well made).\n        \n\n         And his main courses are events: the hanger steak over a smoky eggplant pur\u00e9e with blistered shishito peppers and a rustle of cumin somewhere in the background; the red snapper with octopus and fantastic mussels fried in herbed bread crumbs, one of the nicest treatments I\u2019ve seen anyone give a mussel in a long time; the lamb cooked two ways, most impressively as a braised shank with a deep, almost gamy intensity that fought it out with a teasingly bitter salsa verde made from arugula.\n        \n\n         All of these dishes are brought to a pitch of refinement that is somewhat at odds with the wine-bar spirit. True, Racines NY doesn\u2019t claim to be a wine bar. Neither does its Parisian ancestor. But New Yorkers keep talking about it as if it were one, and it\u2019s easy to see why. A big, open bar dominates the dining room, which doesn\u2019t have the sense of occasion you expect from a restaurant or bistro. In fact, it\u2019s pretty generic.\n        \n\n         The walls are white or brick; the light fixtures are black and simple; the small vineyard photographs are black-and-white on white matte inside skinny black frames. Bottles, an easy and cheap decorative motif, are inexplicably absent from the shelves behind the bar\u2019s barren white surface, which could be mistaken for the cosmetics counter at\n         \n          Barneys\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         Not every French restaurant in New York needs to look like\n         \n          Bofinger\n         \n         , but does this one really have to look quite so much like a spread from\n         \n          the Restoration Hardware catalog\n         \n         ? Especially if you are spending $35 for the morels or $38 for the lamb, prices that approach those of the entry-level wines, you might hope for a room that you could picture when you close your eyes the next day.\n        \n\n         Some New Yorkers will keep Racines NY out of their regular rotation because it doesn\u2019t look French enough. This would be, to put it kindly, dumb. Dinner and drinks at Racines NY come as close as anything in\n         \n\n\n          Manhattan\n         \n         to the flavors of Paris today.\n        \n\n         The last night I ate there, the wine directors for\n         \n          Piora\n         \n         and\n         \n          the Momofuku group\n         \n         were in the house, cherry-picking the list. It doesn\u2019t take an expert to get a great glass at Racines NY.\n         \n\n\n          Stuttering\n         \n         a few disjointed syllables to Mr. Tronche, I ended up drinking a rich, almost tropical\n         \n          Sancerre\n         \n         from Sebastien Riffault, poured from a magnum; a dessert wine from Fran\u00e7ois Pinon, a Vouvray with acidity and sweetness so closely balanced I found it hard to believe; a Reagan-era verdelho, a mere toddler as Madeiras go, that is one of the best companions for a cheese course I\u2019ve ever met. Mr. Tronche could probably even find a wine to get me excited about macarons.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 264, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/23/dining/restaurant-review-racines-ny-in-tribeca.html", "google_mag": 24.200000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n         Some restaurants hit the ground at full tilt. This review concerns one of the others, a place that stumbled at the start, as ungainly as a day-old giraffe, and only recently found its footing.\n        \n\n\n          Bar Bolonat\n         \n         opened in the West Village in March in what seemed an auspicious location, a corner spot looking out on Abingdon Square Park through yards of windows. Two months in,\n         \n\n\n          Einat Admony\n         \n         , the chef and owner, was on the verge of closing it, she said in a phone interview. Nearly half of her 54 seats had been taken away after the city ruled that one wing of the dining room was an unpermitted sidewalk enclosure. The disputed area was quarantined behind a velvet rope, although it was hard to imagine a crowd lining up for admission to this patch of bare cement floor. This put a strain on revenues, no doubt, and made the place look pretty weird.\n        \n\n         Even with reduced capacity, Bar Bolonat was afflicted by suboptimal acoustics. When I ate there early in the summer, the screeching in the dining room could have crushed scrap metal. It nearly crushed my desire to come back, too, but I held on because Ms. Admony was up to something original in the kitchen.\n        \n\n         The\n         \n          daughter of an Iranian mother and Yemenite father,\n         \n         she was combining the flavors of contemporary multiethnic\n         \n\n\n          Israel\n         \n         , where she grew up, with the idioms of modern restaurants in New York, where she has been cooking since getting a job in\n         \n          Bobby Flay\n         \n         \u2019s kitchen at Bolo in 1999. I\u2019d never tasted anything exactly like her shrimp in a Yemenite curry, with a fiery shot of green zhug and a small round of fried bread called malawach to soak up the spicy, turmeric-gold coconut milk. I wanted more food like this in my life, but I wasn\u2019t in a big hurry to face the decibels again.\n        \n\n         Now, with sound-absorbing tiles up above, Bar Bolonat is a quieter restaurant, though it\u2019s not entirely library-like. (One small section of ceiling, without tiles, is angled like the soundboard of a grand piano, with a similar effect.) It\u2019s also bigger. In September, Ms. Admony finally appeased the bureaucrats and returned all her seats to active duty.\n        \n\n         While fixing up the space, she made other changes, replacing executive chefs until she found Molly Breidenthal. When I ate there this month, the cooking was more assured than it had been, the spices applied more fearlessly. The giraffe is on the move.\n        \n\n         Energetic seasoning drives Ms. Admony\u2019s cuisine at Bar Bolonat, as it does at her exemplary falafel shops,\n         \n          Ta\u00efm\n         \n         , and to a lesser extent her Mediterranean comfort food restaurant,\n         \n          Balaboosta\n         \n         . One of Bar Bolonat\u2019s most likable dishes since the unsteady early days has been the lemony grilled baby artichokes with a creamy band of pistachio yogurt under a pale-green powder of dukkah. That blend of chopped nuts and herbs can get tired if it sits around too long, but Bar Bolonat\u2019s is extremely fresh, the pistachios still sweet and bright green.\n        \n\n         A swipe of corn pur\u00e9e takes its seductive, toasty flavor from turmeric, cardamom and ground cloves, Ms. Admony\u2019s version of a warming spice blend called hawaij that Yemenis stir into soups. Together with the creeping heat and sweetness of a red pepper sauce, the spiced corn makes something exciting out of a grilled octopus leg.\n        \n\n         Nearly everybody orders the\n         \n\n\n          Jerusalem\n         \n         -style sesame bagel, so light and fluffy it\u2019s almost an anti-bagel. Nearly everybody is right about this. What makes this racetrack-shaped bread so hard to pass up is the spoonful of really fragrant and complex za\u2019atar that you dunk each piece into after giving it a preliminary bath in peppery olive oil.\n        \n\n         When dishes were underwhelming, as several were one August night, timid seasoning could be to blame. \u201cZa\u2019atar ravioli,\u201d stuffed with smoky eggplant, might have been interesting had it included some actual za\u2019atar. On the other hand, Bar Bolonat\u2019s zabzi, an Iranian fresh-herb stew served with soft specks of fresh couscous, was fantastically vivid, and it could have become one of my favorites if the short rib in the stew had not been tough and dry.\n        \n\n         The dishes at Bar Bolonat are meant to be shared \u2014 everybody sing along \u2014 and come out of the kitchen as they\u2019re ready. Or so the servers say. The menu is split into small, medium and large plates. As common sense would tell you if the servers weren\u2019t telling you otherwise, the bigger ones, like the lamb neck braised with dates and chestnuts until it is pull-apart tender, are a lot easier to split than the few mouthfuls of fluke ceviche with dried pomegranate seeds and juice. The kitchen could do more to help by, say, carving the pomegranate-glazed poussin instead of sending it out whole with a serrated knife.\n        \n\n         The bit about the dishes\u2019 showing up at random times is misleading, too, but in a good way. My table was never laden down with more plates than it could hold. This ought to go without saying, but in restaurants these days nothing does. Apart from one or two unscheduled leaves of absence one night, the service was generally excellent, with a professional bearing that signals Ms. Admony\u2019s intent to have Israeli cuisine taken seriously. The white napkins, polished stemware, sheer curtains and understated modern furniture are all a determined bid for the kinds of diners who would steer clear of anything resembling a hummus hut.\n        \n\n         For dessert, Ms. Admony makes a homey, from-scratch version of Milky, a chocolate pudding brand so central to Israeli life that it became the symbol of\n         \n          a protest\n         \n         this fall against the high cost of living. The halvah cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e tastes more like butterscotch than sesame, but it is worth getting for the tuft of halvah floss on top. The most entertaining and probably the best dessert is a fried envelope of baklava with ice cream sealed inside, although the ice cream should be colder and the pastry hotter if Ms. Admony wants to live up to the high standards once set by the\n         \n          fried ice cream at Chi-Chi\u2019s\n         \n         . Having fought City Hall and the screaming demons of dining-room noise, she\u2019s probably ready for a new challenge.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 265, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/dining/restaurant-review-bar-bolonat-in-the-west-village.html", "google_mag": 23.5}, {"review_text": "\n         Look inside the head of a bright young chef and you\u2019ll see a beehive of swarming ideas, a few of them just hatched and others that buzzed in from somewhere else. It can take time to sort out which are borrowed and which have the sting of the new.\n        \n\n         Thomas Chen, fresh from the trenches at\n         \n          Eleven Madison Park\n         \n         and\n         \n          Commerce\n         \n         , opened his first restaurant in August, called Tuome. Like so many other places in the era of\n         \n          Noma\n         \n         , it is tastefully spartan in appearance. Its two small dining rooms are furnished with small tables set with small menus printed in small type. The wood chairs and metal bar stools are unsoftened by fabric or cushions. The lights are dim \u2014 not flattering, first-date dim but I\u2019m-too-young-to-be-going-blind dim. In terms of glitz and glamour, Tuome falls somewhere between a yoga studio and\n         \n          Thoreau\u2019s cabin\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         I\u2019ve eaten in plenty of rooms like this over the last few years. And I\u2019ve seen any number of dishes resembling these: the\n         \n\n\n          Nike\n         \n         swooshes of ultra-blended vegetable pur\u00e9es; the green leaves the size of chipmunk ears arranged just so over a deviled egg; the row of scallops all crouched together as if hiding from some scallop-hating predator on the other side of the plate. Clearly Mr. Chen and I have been following the same\n         \n\n\n          Instagram\n         \n         feeds.\n        \n\n         That egg, though. Wait a minute. This is something different.\n        \n\n         There is half of a hard-cooked white, deep-fried in panko. Spooned into the divot is a dot of deviled yolk, sharp with pickles and Dijon mustard. On top of that is a spoonful of fried garlic and dried chiles in their spicy red oil. It\u2019s fun to feel the temperatures and textures, creamy and crackling and slippery, meet in your mouth, and to taste the strange collision of church-picnic-style eggs with a Chinese condiment. How can half an egg do three or four things at once?\n        \n\n         Later, a server points a siphon into the crook of an octopus leg. Out comes a suede-colored snowdrift. He says it\u2019s brown-butter-and-potato espuma. I say it\u2019s foam and I say the hell with it. I focus on the octopus, which crunches emphatically and has a rounded, slightly fruity flavor. With it is a chewy, chunky, lightly gingered XO sauce. Chopped caramelized pork and Chinese sausage give it the sweetness of bacon; fish sauce and dried shrimp take it broader and deeper. I can\u2019t get enough of it. The foam will not be ignored forever, though. While it is not the most original notion, it does add something, unlike most foams. What it adds is a fluffy wave of toasted butter, like the frosting on a caramel cake minus the sugar and the heft. The dish is peculiarly good; it makes an extraordinary indulgence out of the octopus. And it shows off the clear and fresh point of view Mr. Chen brings to his cooking, particularly when he interprets Chinese flavors.\n        \n\n         Before working at Eleven Madison Park and Commerce, Mr. Chen was an accountant. The idea was to stay as far from restaurants as possible, and it came from his parents. After moving from\n         \n\n\n          China\n         \n         to\n         \n\n\n          New York City\n         \n         , the Chens operated a Chinese restaurant outside of the city. They wanted something higher for Thomas (he was Tommy at home, but on his parents\u2019 lips the nickname came out \u201ctow me,\u201d which is how Tuome is pronounced), but after shepherding balance sheets by day and attending culinary school by night, he came to see cooking as the higher calling.\n        \n\n         A little more than two months in, Tuome is already starting to feel mature. The one-page wine list is seriously eclectic, but it\u2019s not too cool for a\n         \n\n\n          Napa Valley\n         \n         cabernet and an Anderson Valley chardonnay. The servers take their jobs seriously, although I\u2019m not sure the point has to be underlined by forcing them all to wear tailored T-shirts the color of wet cement. Mr. Chen doesn\u2019t need to make his staff look like a modern dance troupe to tell people Tuome isn\u2019t your average East Village spot; his cooking does that for him. (And the East Village average is getting higher every year.)\n        \n\n         He has terrific control over salt, spices, texture and contrast, weaving them together until you ask, why hasn\u2019t anyone done this before? Adding slick duck fat to packets of Cantonese sticky rice steamed in lotus leaves seems like an obvious good idea. So does the extra crackle he puts into the Chinese sausage bits to save the rice from gummy monotony. But they aren\u2019t obvious until you taste Mr. Chen\u2019s version.\n        \n\n         A few dishes show off Mr. Chen\u2019s technical command more than his originality. The scoop of chicken liver mousse with maple syrup pooled in a hollow on top, like the gravy on mashed potatoes, is exquisitely done, but feels familiar. Another dish fell out of focus between meals, when the carrot-miso pur\u00e9e accompanying seared scallops lost its savory, salty depth and became merely sweet. And there\u2019s one I\u2019d like to forget, a dully sweet squash soup impaled with frogs\u2019 legs that were both mushy and stringy.\n        \n\n         But a striking number of dishes at Tuome are memorable for the right reasons. Serving sous-vide chicken on soupy rice cooked with garlic chives and shiitakes, Mr. Chen doesn\u2019t try to sex up his homey inspiration, congee; he just makes it more layered and modern, surrounding the chicken with a dark basil jus, and lets the flavors quietly win you over.\n        \n\n         I wish he would take the same approach with pork belly instead of forcing it to do double-duty as a marketing event. Right now it\u2019s called the Pig Out (a name meant for hashtagging), and it marches to the table as a $49 feast for two, 10 bite-size squares of pork belly riding on a slate shingle with a parade of sauces and bowls of spicy-peanut noodles following behind. The crashing cymbals can\u2019t disguise how easily the dish, and its price, could be divided in half.\n        \n\n         But Mr. Chen has done something amazing to this pig. His inspiration may have been Cantonese roast pork, but these compressed, intensely flavorful squares of well-rendered belly partake of Peking duck, too. After I\u2019d topped the reflective pane of skin with ginger-scallion sauce and a few drops of sambal from a squeeze bottle, I wanted to tuck the pork into a steamed bun or a crepe, and then chew and crunch and chew and crunch some more. Forget the gimmick. There are fresh ideas in this dish, and they are all Mr. Chen\u2019s.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 266, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/dining/restaurant-review-tuome-in-the-east-village.html", "google_mag": 26.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n         \u201cI want everybody to sing on this one,\u201d the man behind the Casio at the far end of the dining room calls out. \u201cCome on, the two North Korean Jews in the back!\u201d\n        \n\n         Do I have to fill in the picture? To know where we are, do you need to see the smeared pitchers of schmaltz on every table? Smell the chopped garlic on every steak?

What happens at Sammy\u2019s doesn\u2019t happen at other restaurants, and vice versa.\n        \n\n         The rest of the Lower East Side can obsess over filament light bulbs and salvaged barn beams; Sammy\u2019s, virtually unchanged since opening in 1975, will be ready when fluorescents and drop ceilings make their triumphant return to fashion. Inside the dining room, lighted like a bail bondsman\u2019s office in\n         \n\n\n          Detroit\n         \n         , are hundreds of faded business cards, yellowed newspaper clippings and curled snapshots taped and tacked to every surface. Outside on Chrystie Street, scaffolding obscures the faded red and yellow painted signs in front of the building, which looks as if it has been marked for demolition. Like a\n         \n\n\n          Mississippi\n         \n         juke joint, Sammy\u2019s seems to have been put together under the theory that nobody is likely to stay sober long enough to inspect the d\u00e9cor. (Known for selling vodka bottles encased in ice, Sammy\u2019s is New York\u2019s original bottle-service restaurant, and still the only tolerable one.)\n        \n\n         Other steakhouses can drive themselves crazy over internal temperatures. At Sammy\u2019s, the meat will be cooked. If you have something more specific in mind, if you want it medium or black and blue, then write your request on a sheet of paper, tear it into small pieces and throw them into the air when the piano player sings\n         \n\n\n          \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d\n         \n\n\n         Two times I asked for garlic-smeared skirt steak, called Romanian tenderloin at Sammy\u2019s, cooked medium rare. One steak arrived medium well, and the other time a single steak ranged from well done to bloody, and every degree in between. I wasn\u2019t asked how I wanted a broiled veal chop. It was seared on the outside and raw inside, the way other places serve tuna. When nobody asked how I wanted sweetbreads broiled, I feared the worst. Another surprise: Scored and blackened on top, they were close to perfect.\n        \n\n         The servers follow a template unique to this restaurant, too, dressed in Sammy\u2019s T-shirts and jeans with a dishrag swinging from one pocket. Speed trumps ceremony. Standing over a metal bowl of chopped liver, they pour a cascade of schmaltz from on high, go at the liver with forks to mix in the shredded radishes, fried onions and lumps of fried chicken skin, and do not necessarily notice the stray bits that escape the bowl and land on the table. The ritual ends, not with \u201cbon app\u00e9tit\u201d or \u201cenjoy your meal\u201d but with, \u201cO.K., start eating.\u201d\n        \n\n         The classic style of waiting tables at Lower East Side Jewish restaurants, by turns cranky, funny and crankily funny (discerning one from another could take decades of practice) probably died with Ratner\u2019s, but flashes of it still surface at Sammy\u2019s. One night, when we kept asking our server if we\u2019d ordered enough, he rolled his eyes, checked his watch and said, \u201cTell you what: If you\u2019re still hungry, the Chinese food will be here at 9:30.\u201d\n        \n\n         Hungry we weren\u2019t. As always at Sammy\u2019s, I walked out feeling as if I had eaten a football stuffed with chicken fat and beef. The kitchen, so unpredictable when it comes to meat temperatures, is absolutely consistent in its ability to produce starch that detonates inside the stomach. The fried kreplach are grenades of dough with a tiny core of chopped meat that tastes like dough, too. The latkes are flavorless and textureless, but not weightless. Better than either, the kishke could stand some gravy and some salt.\n        \n\n         In fact, with the exception of the grandmotherly sweet-and-sour stuffed cabbage, almost everything at Sammy\u2019s needed salt. Once it was added freely, the chopped liver was beyond reproach, the skirt steaks and lamb chops were excellent, and the fried silver-dollar potatoes were worth talking about. I can\u2019t figure out why Sammy\u2019s is cutting back on sodium after all these years, unless it is suddenly trying to atone for decades of treating schmaltz as a\n         \n\n\n          dietary supplement\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         The menu is less distinctively Romanian than it once was. The\n         \n          last review\n         \n         of Sammy\u2019s in\n         \n\n\n          The New York Times\n         \n         , written by Mimi Sheraton in 1982, praised the Romanian salad of whipped eggplant with green peppers; the broiled brains; the mush steak; the pitcha, a seasoned gelatin made from calves\u2019 feet and garlic; and the baked unborn eggs. The recent menus, stapled inside manila folders as they have been since the Koch administration, haven\u2019t offered any of these specialties. This is how a culture disappears.\n        \n\n         But if\n         \n\n\n          Romania\n         \n         has faded, Sammy\u2019s is still loudly, raucously, endlessly, embracingly Jewish, a permanent underground bar mitzvah where Gentiles can act like Jews and Jews can act like themselves. One night, I went with a woman who had spent the summer in\n         \n\n\n          Europe\n         \n         , as synagogues and Jewish-owned shops burned in one city after another. In Sammy\u2019s basement, when strangers joined their hands in the air and danced between the tables, eyeing our food as they passed, I could see her grow less tense every minute. \u201cIt feels so good to be back in a place where I can be out,\u201d she finally said.\n        \n\n         And if this is not your heritage \u2014 if you aren\u2019t quite sure what is happening when the man at the keyboard belts out \u201cSing us a song, you\u2019re the schmatte man\u201d \u2014 the entertainers at Sammy\u2019s will still get to you. Dancing and singing along to some dumb old tune being played by a musician in the corner: This is how people had fun in the Old World, by which I don\u2019t mean just the parts of Europe where the Lower East Side\u2019s Jews came from, but also the world before amplifiers and apps and first-person-shooter video games and all the forms of entertainment that drive us into ourselves. Sammy\u2019s forces you out of yourself; I don\u2019t think there\u2019s another restaurant in New York where people talk to strangers as readily as they do here.\n        \n\n         \u201cWould you like me to take your picture?\u201d somebody at the next table asked one night. \u201cDo you want our seltzer charger for your egg creams?\u201d another asked us. As a table of about two dozen people filed out, a woman in the back called to them, \u201cThank you for dancing with us!\u201d\n        \n\n         Is this a three-star restaurant, as Mimi Sheraton thought in 1982? By today\u2019s standards, of course not. It is closer to one. But if you need stars to tell you what to think of Sammy\u2019s, I\u2019m not sure I want to share my seltzer charger with you. I\u2019ll give it to those nice North Korean Jews instead.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 267, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/dining/restaurant-review-sammys-roumanian-steakhouse-on-the-lower-east-side.html", "google_mag": 27.700000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n         When I am on my way to a big dinner at a restaurant in Flushing,\n         \n\n\n          Queens\n         \n         , I like to limber up by eating a dozen of Helen You\u2019s dumplings.\n        \n\n         For the last eight years, Ms. You has been the chef and proprietor of the Tianjin Dumpling House, which is not so much a house as a narrow shaft of elbow room behind a sneeze guard in the basement of a Chinese food-vendors\u2019 market on Main Street. The first dumpling of hers that I tried had a sea-bass stuffing cut with minced ginger, which gave bracing clarity to the few drops of broth sealed inside. It was so satisfying that at first I felt no need to branch out.\n        \n\n         The dumplings were irresistibly priced, though, at about $5 a dozen, and I began to experiment with new ones: lamb and chopped zucchini humming with Sichuan peppercorns, maybe, or pork with threads of fresh dill. These were wildly good, too.\n        \n\n         One day, I noticed a sign inviting me to pick my own custom dumpling fillings from a grid of 24 ingredients. This paralyzed me. Ms. You clearly had a kind of genius for creating miniature worlds of flavor. Who was I to tell her what she ought to fold into her circles of dough? It was as if somebody had handed me a box of feathers, bones, beaks and flesh and said, \u201cHere, build a parrot.\u201d\n        \n\n         What I wanted was more of Ms. You\u2019s recipes, not mine, and I got my wish earlier this year when Ms. You opened\n         \n          Dumpling Galaxy\n         \n         a few blocks from her original stall. Dumpling Galaxy sits back from the street, inside a shiny new mall it shares with a Korean-French bakery and a purveyor of sparkly false eyelashes. Ms. You designed the striking, modern interior herself, splashing bold Chinese red across walls with a basket-weave relief and building deep semiprivate booths, each with its own TV screen showing highlights of the 100 dumplings on the menu.\n        \n\n         The Dumpling Channel goes heavy on cross-section shots that reveal the central core of filling. Take a good look, because this is a sight you should never see if you want to get the most out of a meal at Dumpling Galaxy. Resist the exploratory nibble. Dip one side in black vinegar and soy, and paint it with chile oil if you like, then pocket the whole thing in your mouth. It won\u2019t gush with a waterfall of broth. It will, however, hold a few drops of liquid shed by the filling as the dumpling boiled. Those drops belong to you.\n        \n\n         Sometimes those juices taste like fresh green herbs, as when Ms. You mixes cilantro with minced lamb, or dill with excellent softly scrambled eggs. Sometimes they combine those qualities with a\n         \n\n\n          whiplash\n         \n         of heat, as in the head-twistingly good spicy beef dumpling, seasoned with scallions, fresh red and green chiles, and searing dried chile sauce.\n        \n\n         As a young girl in Tianjin,\n         \n\n\n          China\n         \n         , Ms. You was taught to cook by her mother and grandparents. Her dumplings are sturdy, knobby, domestic creatures in the Northern Chinese tradition. Sometimes you see the ghostly outline of the fillings through the shiny white skins, and sometimes you can\u2019t. But her dumplings are stuffed to order, and Ms. You fine-tunes them with the sensitivity of a natural cook who listens to her ingredients. Mixing shrimp with two varieties of celery, the more bitter and self-assured Chinese and the sweeter, shyer Western kind, and using both stalks and leaves, she builds exhilarating harmonies.\n        \n\n         It would be a miracle on Main Street if all 100 varieties at Dumpling Galaxy were equally lovable. They aren\u2019t. The one with shrimp, scallops and crab meat didn\u2019t deliver the sweet seafood luxury it promised. Steamed har gow were less juicy than those wheeled around on the best dim sum carts. My strategy is to seek out the proprietary blends, which justify prices that can be slightly higher (as much as $7.95 for six) than those at other places in Flushing, including Tianjin Dumpling House.\n        \n\n         I\u2019ve eaten entire meals that delivered less flavor than a single one of Ms. You\u2019s dumplings stuffed with terrific little meatballs of duck and shiitakes. And if those hadn\u2019t cheered me up, the fried dumplings would. Ms. You pours watery cornstarch into the pan, which bubbles and browns into a shatteringly thin, dumpling-studded pancake. Cracking that crust, I felt like the happiest guy in the galaxy.\n        \n\n         That feeling wavered whenever I had to lean out of my booth with one arm extended for minutes at a time to ask for water or the check or for empty dishes to be cleared. It was like hailing a cab on Broadway at 5 p.m., but less effective. As time dragged on, I wondered why nobody had invented\n         \n\n\n          Uber\n         \n         for waiters.\n        \n\n         Looking at the tables of Chinese families, I noticed that their dumpling consumption was considerably less piggish than mine. They might share a single order, a mere six dumplings, before moving on to the dishes from Northern China, Hunan and Fujian on the rest of the menu. (One cook specializes in each region.)\n        \n\n         I came to see the wisdom of allowing fish and vegetables to supplement all the boiled flour I was ingesting. The Hunanese preserved pork stir-fried with stubby lengths of pickled long beans was superb, both fiery and tart. Triple delight vegetables (green chiles, barely tender potato and eggplant so creamy it may as well be pudding) was an unusually good version of the Dongbei standby. Whole fish with spicy bean sauce was a hit at my table, even if we did use the marvelous sauce to obscure the fish\u2019s slightly muddy flavor.\n        \n\n         You can find these dishes elsewhere, but no other kitchen offers such an embarrassment of dumpling riches, including dessert. Some sweet dumplings are pinched in dough like the savory ones, such as tart dried hawthorn berries with white wood ears, or pear with eight treasures, which I now think of as fruitcake pirogi.\n        \n\n         Others, called tang yuan, are tinted orbs of dough that are springy and chewy, like mochi. My favorite was the pumpkin-flavored globe with a sugary paste of black sesame at the core. These orange globes arrived, not on a plate like the others, but bobbing in a thick, clear, steaming soup. I could stare at ingredient lists all day and never come up with a parrot like this.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 268, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/dining/restaurant-review-dumpling-galaxy-in-queens.html", "google_mag": 26.399999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n\n             Casa Mono\n            \n            has a lot to answer for. Founded by Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich in 2003, it was among the earliest and most influential restaurants to twist the Spanish tapas idiom into what New Yorkers learned to call small-plates dining. The Casa Mono style has spread far and wide, leaving in its wake a trail of cluttered tables, unpredictably sequenced dishes, and diners reduced to asking pathetically, \u201cWill that be enough food?\u201d\n           \n\n            All of this might earn Casa Mono the historical notoriety bestowed on early tremors of annoying or inconvenient trends, like the first spam email, if it weren\u2019t the case that almost everyone agrees that Casa Mono has always been very good. To that I\u2019ll add a contention of my own. The pleasures of eating there are both richer and more varied than in 2004, when this tiny, perpetually crowded restaurant was last reviewed in The New York Times. (Marian Burros gave it\n            \n             two stars\n            \n            .)\n           \n\n            Andy Nusser, the executive chef and an owner, kept the tapas fairly uncomplicated in the early days. Roasted piquillo peppers filled with juicy braised oxtail were on the menu then, are there now, and probably will be forever. The seared skirt steak, served with sweet stewed onions and a romesco that crunches with coarsely chopped almonds, is still one of the most elementally satisfying one-course meals near Union Square. It\u2019s even better if you eat it alone at the bar, which may be your only option on those nights when reservations are impossible.\n           \n\n            But over the years, the kitchen has branched out into cooking that a Catalan tapas-bar proprietor might squint at before deciding that tapas do not always need to be interpreted with a strict-constructionist approach.\n           \n\n            In this era of sea urchin overload, there is still a wild thrill to be had from the sweet and briny orange lobes at Casa Mono, stirred with chopped walnuts and lime zest into very soft scrambled eggs that have been splashed with colatura. The menu calls this condiment \u201cancient anchovy oil.\u201d How ancient I have no idea, but from the looks of happy disbelief around the table, I\u2019d say just ancient enough.\n           \n\n            Or take the section of the menu called \u201cWhole Organic Animals.\u201d You may ask how a small plate can hold a whole animal larger than a quail. What the menu is trying to say is that Casa Mono buys entire beasts that once browsed on Hudson Valley pastures, then carves them up and serves them in portions that in Spain would be called raciones.\n           \n\n            Casa Mono\u2019s drive into meatier terrain is largely the doing of Anthony Sasso, named chef de cuisine in 2008 when Mr. Nusser shifted most of his attention to other Batali restaurants. Mr. Sasso learned to swing a cleaver at\n            \n             Fleisher\u2019s\n            \n            , the nose-to-tail butcher shop in Kingston, N.Y. This is one butcher-chef who does not try to hand you a dripping bouquet of snouts and spleens. Most of his \u201cwhole animal\u201d dishes are ones that even cautious carnivores may try. And try they should, because the reward will be flavors whose depth and complexity are still too rare in American meat.\n           \n\n            Streaky lamb belly, rolled around tomatoes and raisins, had an extremely alluring balance of chewy lean and tender fat; the quality of the meat made the splash of mint salsa verde seem like a new idea. Lamb leg, with its more untamed flavor, was braised in cider and cinnamon, then folded into a sweet and nutty mole, with a memorable trace of bittersweetness that came from dark Spanish chocolate.\n           \n\n            A slab of goat confit, patiently simmered in olive oil, had a clear, clean flavor. Goat responds well to extra richness, which it got from guacamole strengthened by goat cheese, and from half an avocado cured in sugar. Bricks of meaty and very tender pork belly came with fried plantains, thin slices of honey-cured ham, pickles, garlic and a honey-banana mustard whose sweetness didn\u2019t go over the top. As loaded with surprises as it was with flavor, this was Mr. Sasso\u2019s tribute to the Cuban sandwich.\n           \n\n            Seafood is a major theme on the menu, too, and usually a rewarding one. Four razor clams cooked on a plancha and sloshed with olive oil would have been great if one of the four hadn\u2019t been nearly raw. But baby octopus from the same plancha were tender inside and lightly crunchy along their suckers; they were served with shaved fennel and lumps of pink grapefruit, as they have been since Mr. Nusser dreamed up the dish a decade ago.\n           \n\n            The crema catalana hasn\u2019t changed, either. Burned sugar still tops the custard like thin black ice. It still comes with bay leaf fritters. You still eat these by pinching the stem, biting down and stripping the sweetly scented dough away from the leaf with your teeth.\n           \n\n            Other desserts have added layers of polyphony. The most rambunctious of all involves bite-size churros, their crisp ridges pressed into chocolate ganache. A scoop of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche ice cream is painted maroon by a sauce based on Spain\u2019s demented and inspired spritzer, red wine and Coca-Cola, fortified with cherries. It\u2019s a perfectly controlled dessert that seems to be on the verge of total, wanton collapse.\n           \n\n            Mr. Batali\u2019s\n            \n             other restaurants\n            \n            treat the Hudson Valley as if it were a lost region of Italy. Casa Mono does something similar, using the Greenmarket down the block as if it were the\n            \n             Mercat de la Boqueria\n            \n            in Barcelona, Spain. A softball-size heirloom tomato is dotted with popcorn-flavored aioli; pickled hot peppers are tossed over a voluptuous blob of burrata that sprawls across anchovy toast.\n           \n\n            The wines, of course, make a longer trip. In a miracle of space management, this micro-restaurant keeps what has to be the deepest, most pleasure-packed trove of Spanish wine in the city. The sherries alone, many bottled by the young, treasure-hunting Equipo Navazos firm, could see you through a solid month of meals. Titans like Pingus and Palacios are available for those who can pay for them, but Rachel Merriam, the wine director, has filled the list with well-priced discoveries, too.\n           \n\n            I found plenty of them with the help of sommeliers who seem to know instinctively when to stick with tradition and when to go off road. A request for something that would drink like cru Beaujolais was answered with a soft red Txakolina that had a bittersweet finish. And despite the crowds, the sommeliers always had time to talk. If you have questions about fractional aging, as we did, Casa Mono is the place for you.\n           \n\n            The sommeliers are so attentive that I didn\u2019t feel neglected one night when I couldn\u2019t quite figure out which server was in charge of our table. Service can be a little diffuse at times. In a place this size, though, help is never far away.\n           \n\n            Only three items (including a rabbit, in multiple parts) are listed at more than $20 on the menu, which runs from noon to midnight. The dining room, with glass doors on 17th Street that swing open in warm weather, is at its most charming in the slack hours between lunch and dinner. Even when packed, though, the little room has pockets of, if not privacy, then at least intimacy.\n           \n\n            The mosaic tile floors are now so worn down they look like Roman ruins.

Somehow she had wandered into a new restaurant serving no-choice, two-hour-long menus that climax with a volley of vegetables and seafood, swished around in batter and sent to a pan of hot oil for a final swim.\n           \n\n            The white-oak counter where she was sitting, in fact, is bent like an elbow to give all nine chairs around it a view of that oil. Above the pan stood Masao Matsui, who has been frying tempura at one place or another since 1968.\n            \n             Ootoya\n            \n            , the Japanese-based restaurant group, built this serene cloister on East 39th Street for, and named it after, this man.\n           \n\n            Dinner at\n            \n             Tempura Matsui\n            \n            with nothing fried? Asking\n            \n             Nathan\u2019s\n            \n            for a plate of seasonal organic vegetables would make more sense.\n           \n\n            After a brief conference with the staff (\u201cYou can\u2019t just do some sushi and sashimi?\u201d her date asked), she was off to eat somewhere else. I stayed to see whether the tempura is special enough to build a $200 menu around it.\n           \n\n            Following the traditional order of kaiseki meals, dinner this September night got off to a light start: a small glass of dashi with spinach and bits of matsutake mushrooms, just coming into season on that week. When they were gone, I knocked back the dashi. It was cool, clear and very delicious.\n           \n\n            The server said that what came next was a bowl of tofu. My tongue said it was my destiny, the fulfillment of my earthly desires, or at least all the ones that can conceivably be fulfilled by bean curd. Eating it was like spooning up the densest top layer from the neck of a bottle of pure cream. For a few minutes, everything else went away and we were alone, the tofu and I, floating together in a void somewhere.\n           \n\n            O.K.,\n            \n             that was weird!\n            \n            Three little appetizers, the best being two pieces of anago sushi about the size of Chiclets, snapped me back to the normal world. The sashimi that arrived next may have been a little too normal. The tuna belly was definitely too cold by a couple of degrees, and while the squid was exceptionally sweet and the fluke very firm, the ensemble seemed a bit unimaginative for a kaiseki meal costing this much.\n           \n\n            Then servers ducked in from the wings and moved the scenery into position for the next act, the tempura. There was a square dish for pink miso salt. Another for white salt scraped from a large solid crystal behind the counter that looks as if it will last 1,000 years. Dipping sauce came in a ceramic bowl, shaped by hand and stamped all over with stars or asterisks. A dish next to it held grated daikon, and a spoon for mixing it into the sauce. Finally, there was a squeezer just big enough for a lemon wedge. Martha Stewart has eaten at Tempura Matsui a few times since it opened in July. I\u2019ll bet she thought about pocketing this lemon squeezer.\n           \n\n            Then, on yet another dish, was a sheet of crisply folded white paper. It is for blotting up any oil that runs off the tempura\u2019s crust. On this night, there wasn\u2019t going to be any.\n           \n\n            Mr. Matsui skimmed stray dribbles of batter from the pan, looked up, smiled. A few weeks after Tempura Matsui opened, an undisclosed personal matter had recalled him to Japan. Shin Kato, who was 18 when he began to study the ways of the shimmering oil at Mr. Matsui\u2019s side, took over. Now they share the chef title. On this night, Mr. Matsui happened to be in town and was at his station, looking loose and relaxed, like Dizzy Gillespie waiting to take a solo.\n           \n\n            Two fried heads of Japanese tiger shrimp were placed on the paper, spidery pink antennas and maxillipeds angling out in all directions. They were extraordinary, like eating potato chips at first, then like tasting a plate of shrimp that had been concentrated down to a single bite.\n           \n\n            The rest of the beast showed up next, slender bodies and trimmed, edible tails in a see-through veil of batter. Mr. Matsui is a minimalist fryer. His coating was less shell than skin, and he heated it just enough to give it a golden blush. The shrimp were dizzily tender and heavy with their own sweetness. So was the fat Pacific oyster that came along a few minutes later: Warmed but not cooked, it gave up a rush of rich oceanic juices and tasted a bit like cucumber. By the time I tasted the nori-wrapped and fried scallop, still pink at the center, I was convinced that this was one of the most exciting meals I\u2019d had this year.\n           \n\n            The exhilaration of that night was not as intense on later visits. Even that first time, I wondered about the tempura asparagus. Did Mr. Matsui have a special farmer who grew delicious asparagus in September? He did not. Neither did Mr. Kato, who was serving asparagus when he was back behind the pan again in October. I doubted a tempura chef in Japan would bother frying asparagus when pumpkin was in season.\n           \n\n            I never warmed up to the crunchy onion half both chefs served, either. And while Mr. Matsui fried a Japanese eggplant to a puddinglike sweetness, Mr. Kato\u2019s eggplant was not as softly thrilling. His seafood choices at my last meal \u2014 two species of eel and a flaky Japanese whiting \u2014 were very fine but a little monotonous.\n           \n\n            There were eight kinds of tempura at each of my meals. Apparently, some customers expected more fried food from a tempura specialist, so the restaurant recently increased the number. I never wanted more tempura, though; I wanted more interesting tempura.\n           \n\n            After a funny little salad to wipe the palate clean \u2014 Mr. Matsui\u2019s had seaweed with grapes, while Mr. Kato\u2019s grapes came with pickled mushrooms and vinegared apple pulp \u2014 came a dish I could eat once a week, a fritter of cut-up shrimp over excellent short-grain rice. At Tempura Matsui, it is served with pickles and a really terrific miso soup. For dessert, I was very happy about soybean jelly with a dark-brown sugar syrup, less enthralled with the grapefruit-flavored Bavarian cream.\n           \n\n            Experiencing tempura as a serious craft is a thrill, but Mr. Matsui\u2019s style ensures that almost all the pleasure comes from whatever is being cooked inside that diaphanously thin batter. How many people will pay $200 for fried asparagus in fall when we can eat a kaiseki meal with a greater range of truly special seasonal ingredients at, say,\n            \n             Kyo Ya\n            \n            or\n            \n             Kajitsu\n            \n            ? Tempura Matsui\u2019s chefs and owners may be underestimating New Yorkers. Many of us are free of fried-food allergies, and ready for an adventure.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 272, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/dining/tempura-matsui-murray-hill-review.html", "google_mag": 27.200000762939453}, {"review_text": "\n            If you hope dinner at\n            \n             the Clocktower\n            \n            will get you a backstage view of the ticking cogs at the top of the former Metropolitan Life Tower, forget it. The restaurant is on the second floor of the New York Edition hotel, which opened in the skyscraper at the foot of Madison Avenue in May. Marriott and Ian Schrager, who run the place, brought in the restaurateur\n            \n             Stephen Starr\n            \n            to operate the Clocktower.\n           \n\n            To get there, you can take the elevator from the lobby, or you can disappear up what looks like a big white cocoon into a tight spiral staircase. Upstairs, burning candles in glass lanterns flank the floor of the elevator bank. Somebody, maybe you, will notice this too late and kick one over.\n           \n\n            \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it happens all the time,\u201d a host says, not all that reassuringly. She leads you past the billiards table upholstered in felt the color of grape jelly and into the bar, where you rescue a female friend who has been sent there to wait for the rest of your party. She has been there just long enough to stand uncomfortably while every man in the room checks her out.\n           \n\n            The Clocktower plays a familiar game, the private club that has accidentally let you in. There are three small, connected dining rooms. Yours has a dark green marble fireplace big enough to roast a goat. Above the wainscoting of book-matched burl and below the wedding-cake crown moldings, original fixtures ordered up by some long-dead insurance executive, hang framed photographs in black and white, one above another, gallery style. They show celebrities from the 1950s, \u201960s and \u201970s, dozens and dozens of them. When you ask about one, a server brings you an explanatory booklet printed on heavy paper stock.\n           \n\n            Your waiter wants to talk about the menu. Seafood is listed under Seafood and salads under Salads. You nod. Orders placed, you get a small round loaf of bread, cut in quarters, steaming. \u201cI.P.A.-rye sourdough with buttermilk and butter.\u201d The crust shatters on impact; the crumb has a prickle of tartness. In five minutes, you want another loaf.\n           \n\n            When the seafood-under-Seafood arrives, you know the bread was a preview of what\u2019s in store. There\u2019s citrus-marinated shaved fennel, so bright that it tingles, over the chilled lobster salad served in its shell. A sweet king crab leg with cucumber-pickle curls and dashi jelly rides high on chipped ice spread out over a silver pedestal. Cubes of raw scallop and hamachi are spread over a chunky pesto that\u2019s surprisingly right. This chef can cook. Who is he, anyway?\n           \n\n            His name is\n            \n             Jason Atherton\n            \n            . You\u2019ll read later that he was raised in an English resort town on the North Sea, where his parents ran a small hotel. That he spent five years working for Gordon Ramsay. Like Mr. Ramsay, he now has restaurants in London and around the world. Unlike Mr. Ramsay, he is not a magnet for controversy, which may be why his landing in New York has been less bumpy than his former boss\u2019s.\n           \n\n            Also, there is very little egotism in Mr. Atherton\u2019s cooking. He seems to have the peculiar idea of cooking to make other people happy, not to reflect his own glory.\n           \n\n            You\u2019ve heard that he serves contemporary English food at the Clocktower. It doesn\u2019t taste much like England to you. There are exceptions, like the suave and gentle Lancashire hot pot, a traditional mutton stew that Mr. Atherton makes with rabbit, to excellent effect. It\u2019s so good that you ignore the other, fancier half of the dish, a pastry-wrapped bullet of spongy rabbit loin and slightly overcooked foie gras.\n           \n\n            How to describe the rest? It\u2019s festive and generous, and it looks exciting. Classic sauces and techniques are used, but they don\u2019t feel like old hat. Mr. Atherton\u2019s cooking is not pretentious, but it has the celebratory elegance that traditional hotel dining rooms promise to deliver and rarely do.\n           \n\n            A beurre blanc, taking its gentle heat and berrylike flavor from pink peppercorns, is genuinely exciting over gleaming braised halibut; so is the carrot pur\u00e9e that\u2019s somewhere between a sauce and a vegetable. You\u2019re even happier with the roasted king salmon that gets along wonderfully with its sauce of chives and chopped oysters.\n           \n\n            Of course, there is Dover sole, and you appreciate the time-honored treatment of brown butter, lemon and capers. You admire the duck \u00e0 l\u2019orange, too, the chew of the breast pieces, the concentration of the confit and the way the sauce conveys the fragrance of oranges without the sweetness.\n           \n\n            These sauces are spooned or poured when the dish is served, a formal gesture that the Clocktower pulls off without stuffiness. Maybe the stage business ought to stop there, you think. While one server points out each variety of raw oyster, another stands off to one side holding a tray of condiments. He stares into space, no doubt wondering where on the small table he is supposed to put all this stuff. A terrific piece of smoked thigh that comes with chicken breast, nicely roasted with herb stuffing under the skin, is served in a drawer that slides out of a little box.\n           \n\n            Some of this hyperactivity may fall away as the restaurant matures. Perhaps somebody will also toss out half the bottles at the bar; a lot of the cocktails have two or three more ingredients than they need.\n           \n\n            You took a few sips of a cloying pineapple-rum concoction garnished with glow sticks and a temporary tattoo, then ran for the sanity of the wine list. When the stock market stops correcting itself, you may splurge on a $400 Bordeaux; this week calls for a bottle in the $40 to $60 range. Clocktower has scores of them.\n           \n\n            Now you want dessert. You want all the desserts, in fact, so it\u2019s a good thing you brought a crowd. The pastry chef, S\u00e9bastien Rouxel, has the same solid hold on classic technique and proven flavors that Mr. Atherton does. His pistachio souffl\u00e9, with a lump of chocolate-yogurt ice cream dropped through its roof at the last minute, is virtually perfect. You wish he would get the ice crystals out of the vanilla ice cream that comes with a tarte Tatin, but the sticky caramelized apples make you unreasonably happy, and while it\u2019s billed as a portion for two, it\u2019s easily enough for four.\n           \n\n            The table is still jammed, and here come some treats in a vintage McVitie\u2019s biscuit tin. You make room because everything in that tin is good, from the crumbly-tender shortbread to the toffee brittle coated with dark chocolate and chopped peanuts.\n           \n\n            The check comes. You do the math, not just the tip, but the more subtle calculation of whether this is a fair deal. The Dover sole was more than $50, but it always is. Other main courses were in the $20s, which is rare in this style of restaurant. And there were great little surprises all through the meal. You sign your name. You\u2019ll be back.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 273, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/26/dining/restaurant-review-the-clocktower-in-midtown-south.html", "google_mag": 28.0}, {"review_text": "\n         Hanging from Via Carota\u2019s ceiling, menacing a large farmhouse table that had been surrounded by smiling customers just a few minutes earlier, was a row of long iron spikes, bent into hooks at their ends.

Several possibilities suggested themselves, from medieval torture device to a particularly inhumane way of catching fish.\n        \n\n         \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask Jody,\u201d a server said after admitting that she didn\u2019t really know what the thing was either. \u201cEvery day, she brings in something else that she\u2019s just found.

She shares responsibility for Via Carota\u2019s Italian menu with the chef Rita Sodi,\n         \n          her partner\n         \n         in both business and domestic matters. When it comes, however, to buying antique nail barrels, china hutches, silver teapots, seltzer siphons, porcelain creamers, glazed cheese crocks, woven wood baskets, woven metal baskets and other stuff to fill a restaurant, Ms. Williams does it all by herself.\n        \n\n         Her eye for dressing a room is well known by the many people who swear by Ms. Williams\u2019s other restaurant,\n         \n          Buvette\n         \n         , a hop and a skip to the west on Grove Street. Buvette is filled with antiques and flea-market triumphs, starting with the black\n         \n\n\n          Raleigh\n         \n         bicycle left unchained on the sidewalk, as if the owner had just popped in for a croque-monsieur on the way to buy an armful of leeks. Buvette is French, and its premise seems to be that everything about\n         \n\n\n          France\n         \n         and the French is deeply adorable. The tables, the plates, even the silverware are about two sizes smaller than normal. Many people, some of whom live in\n         \n\n\n          Paris\n         \n         , where a second Buvette is a big hit, find all this irresistible. But it always makes me feel as if I\u2019m on the set of a Wes Anderson film wearing a large trash bag while everybody else is dressed in vintage\n         \n\n\n          Boy Scout\n         \n         uniforms.\n        \n\n         Fortunately, while Via Carota has been energetically propped, it avoids the preciousness of Buvette. There is an ambient cuteness level, to be sure, but it is balanced by an Italian severity; the spiky iron chandelier (made by the sculptor Warren Muller from a clam rake) hanging over the charming cocktail coupes. The beechwood chairs with built-in pockets for books, for instance, came from a chapel in\n         \n\n\n          Wales\n         \n         . They make you sit up straight.\n        \n\n         Best of all, Ms. Williams and Ms. Sodi are cooking deeply appealing food, without mugging.\n        \n\n         Ms. Sodi is a stickler about classic Italian pasta, which forms the foundation of her own small restaurant nearby,\n         \n          I Sodi\n         \n         . You can tell she is a stickler because her pastas taste the way they are supposed to taste, the sauces not too complicated or heavily applied, the noodles not too tight and not too flabby.\n        \n\n         I might have liked a little more wildness in the wild-boar rag\u00f9 over pappardelle, but I could not have asked for a more rounded, balanced, mellow rag\u00f9 or more supple noodles. And while pasta with black truffles may not sound modest, there was nothing ostentatious about the irregular patches of pasta called stracci (it means \u201crags\u201d) turned with melted butter, Parmigiano-Reggiano and truffle shavings; it seemed, in fact, like the only sensible thing to do with a truffle.\n        \n\n         Apart from calling it a svizzerina and topping it with rosemary and whole garlic cloves, they make no attempt to prettify the chopped New York strip steak. Molded into a puck and seared on cast iron, it is both simple and amazing. Those of us who believe that the best burgers are chopped with knives, as this one is, will especially love the way the svizzerina feels in the mouth, substantial and even slightly luxurious, a quality that steak loses the minute it goes through a meat grinder.\n        \n\n         Like most of the meat and fish dishes, the bunless, French-fry-less svizzerina stands more or less alone, Italian style. Under the very simple and very good rabbit, patiently pan-fried, you will get a slice of fried bread to take care of any oil. If you like the taste of rabbit, this is the dish for you. A stub of grilled octopus leg gets a mound of green-olive relish.\n        \n\n         If all this pasta and protein sends you looking for vegetables, you will find yourself in one of Via Carota\u2019s strongholds. There are vegetables of all shapes and sizes, and with them the chefs give up a bit of their severity and start to play. Twiglike salsify roots were caramelized in brown butter, almost candied, and wonderful. A fennel bulb, cooked until tender, was dressed in orange pulp and orange zest. Shafts of leeks, poached and served cool, were topped with shavings of cured mullet roe and grated hard-cooked eggs; suddenly, I did not want to see leeks served any other way. Only with the grilled radicchio did they go over the top, piling on sweetness with currants and balsamic vinegar, then enriching everything with soft caprino cheese.\n        \n\n         But that kind of excess is just what Via Carota typically and gracefully avoids. Creamy stracchino cheese may seem too rich to stand in for fresh mozzarella on crostini with cherry tomatoes, especially tomatoes that have been sun-dried to a raisin-like sweetness. As things turn out, it\u2019s phenomenal. So is the mash of walnuts, honey and lardo that the chefs spread on another crostino, one that would be just as good at breakfast or dessert, or with cheese or yogurt. It would probably be good sold from a vending machine at the Port Authority.\n        \n\n         But then you would miss the short and no-nonsense list of drinks made from as few ingredients as possible (Italian-style, again). Or the much longer but still no-nonsense wine list, which covers a lot of ground without letting the prices get too out of hand. (Do keep an eye on the bottom line, though. It\u2019s surprisingly easy to reach $100 a person if you decide to taste something from each category on the menu.) Or the very tender crostata with a thin, sticky layer of raspberry jam.\n        \n\n         Most of all, you\u2019d miss the chance to see the West Village take to this restaurant as if it had been around as long as one of Ms. Williams\u2019s olive bowls.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 274, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/04/dining/restaurant-review-via-carota-in-the-west-village.html", "google_mag": 25.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n         \u201cGo to Upland\u201d is my current answer to anybody who asks for a good new place to eat in\n         \n\n\n          Manhattan\n         \n         .

Upland occupies the middle ground, a big restaurant where the set dressing feels like an event but doesn\u2019t compete with the food.\n        \n\n         For the kitchen, Mr. Starr recruited Justin Smillie, whose intensely flavorful spins on Italian cuisine at\n         \n          Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria\n         \n         won him national notice. Upland\u2019s 88-seat dining room and vast menu would make some of his peers, serenely accustomed to arranging brassica specimens at tasting counters the size of egg cartons, collapse in a swoon. Lucky for us, Mr. Smillie is made of sturdier stuff.\n        \n\n         His menu splashes around in the gentle, sun-dappled river of classic\n         \n\n\n          California\n         \n         cuisine, with special attention to its junctions with the\n         \n          Jonathan Waxman\n         \n         and\n         \n          Jeremiah Tower\n         \n         tributaries. (Upland is the name of the town in San Bernardino County where Mr. Smillie was raised; Mr. Waxman was a mentor.) Mr. Smillie\u2019s pizzas, built on a tender crust with puffy lips, are freewheeling, like the very good one with pears, arugula and soft stracciatella cheese underscored by aged balsamic and a pesto that crunches with chopped pecans. His pastas can be tried and true, like the firm and well-peppered bucatini slick with tangy pecorino or the long, star-shaped tubes called estrella tossed with a just-right saut\u00e9 of chicken livers with rosemary and sage. Or they may surprise you, like the spicy spaghettini that get their potent oceanic flavor from invisible baby sardines. Either way, they\u2019re further confirmation that Mr. Smillie is one of the city\u2019s pasta savants.\n        \n\n         As he showed in his last kitchen, he\u2019s something of a vegetable sage, too. Celery root never struck me as a showstopper, exactly, until I tasted the one at Upland, slowly roasted into an intense and creamy globe and brushed with black truffle butter. Everybody at my table always wanted to try his deep-fried hen-of-the-woods mushroom, and everybody was always happy swiping it in herbed Cloumage, a charming cousin of ricotta brought down from southern\n         \n\n\n          Massachusetts\n         \n         . And a main course of Tasmanian sea trout was made memorable by its vegetable side, a section of sweet, ivory-colored cone cabbage permeated by smoke.\n        \n\n         The burrata purist at my table was dubious about the heaps of trout roe and frizz of fried leeks Mr. Smillie piled on top of the near-liquid cheese, but the rest of us spooned it up, wishing we had a toasted everything bagel to complete the picture. When it was gone, we weren\u2019t sure we would have the energy for the plate of duck wings, like confit with a bone handle. But the sparks of heat and citrus in the yuzu kosho vinaigrette on the skin kept us going until we began to think that Upland deserves a place in the annals of poultry wing cookery alongside the\n         \n          Anchor Bar in Buffalo\n         \n         .\n        \n\n         Among the main courses, the grilled branzino with a scallion-heavy salsa verde was solid if unsurprising. The pork chop, though, half-moons of sweet persimmon and hot red peppers on top, was a sensation. I thought about Mr. Smillie\u2019s gift for building flavor upon flavor as I chewed on the tiny squares of crackling that wrapped around the bone.\n        \n\n         His menu rambles a bit, and it\u2019s no surprise that not all of the 30 or so dishes glide with swanlike grace. Chilled and decidedly al dente farro spaghetti seemed like an odd choice for a cold sea urchin sauce, and the whole notion is unlikely to melt anyone\u2019s heart in the dead of winter. Wads of spicy grated radish smothered the sweetness of just-shucked raw scallops. And the short rib with walnuts and unruly curls of shaved celery that was roasted on a rotisserie at Il Buco Alimentari hasn\u2019t fully acclimated to being cooked in an oven on East 26th Street; there seems to be less of the deeply caramelized meat around the edges, and it\u2019s less satisfying to chew on, while the bite of the peppercorns is more bullying than I remember. And I wondered about the size of the dining room when two out of three pastas showed up lukewarm one night.\n        \n\n         After some early critical grumbling about the desserts, a new pastry chef from\n         \n\n\n          Thomas Keller\n         \n         \u2019s fleet, S\u00e9bastien Rouxel, was installed shortly before Christmas. I hope he sets the whisks and rolling pins in order quickly because I\u2019ve yet to meet a dessert at Upland that I\u2019d come back for, let alone one that suggests the easy rapport Mr. Smillie has with his ingredients.\n        \n\n         For now, there is more excitement to be had in slaloming around Chantelle Pabros\u2019s wine cellar. She has assembled one of the most accessible, least dogmatic lists in town, with dozens of bottles under $50, as if that were the way all wine lists worked. (It isn\u2019t, but it should be.) New Yorkers can challenge their parochial disdain for California wines with classics like Chateau Montelena and leaders of the modern style like Cathy Corison. Or they can dip into one of several affordable Bordeaux, so unfashionable, so delicious. There is more than a token sampling of reds from\n         \n\n\n          Portugal\n         \n         , and three Canadian Chardonnays, patiently waiting for America to notice.\n        \n\n         The interior is lined by shelf after shelf of preserved lemons in jars, each one illuminated by three tiny LEDs until they become something like citrus lamps. When their marmalade glow hits the copper trim around the dining room, it gives off a light warmer than anything I\u2019ve seen in a restaurant before. The tables in the dining room are generously large, the seats the kind you want to stay in all night. Not so in the bar, where two of my guests, arriving early, were deposited on hard-backed wood benches near the after-work mob. When I appeared, there was a whispered conference by the coat room. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d a host finally said to my guests, \u201cI forgot to ask if you\u2019d like to sit in the dining room.\u201d\n        \n\n         If she forgets to ask you, too, tell her I said the dining room is the place to be.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 275, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/dining/restaurant-review-upland-on-park-avenue-south.html", "google_mag": 23.5}, {"review_text": "\n            In a nest of dried grass and feathery moss sat an eggshell, its top neatly lopped off. Caviar and a crinkle of gold leaf shone just inside the rim. Underneath were layers of custard and hairy crab, a seasonal freshwater treat from China whose taste is a lot more seductive than its name. The rich, smooth pleasure in each spoonful almost made my head pop.\n           \n\n            The egg was one of the first things I ate at\n            \n             La Chine\n            \n            , which opened in November inside the Waldorf Astoria, specializing in Chinese food made with finesse and an eye for beauty. This could get interesting, I thought. In fact, the rest of the meal and the two that followed did get interesting, in ways that those of us who love the cuisines of China wish would happen more often in New York.\n           \n\n            Downtown Manhattan, Flushing in Queens and Sunset Park in Brooklyn are rich in Chinese restaurants. Their cooking can range from filling to thrilling, but it rarely aspires to climb the slopes of creativity. Ingredients are generally good but not stellar, limited as they are by the prices these restaurants can charge. Unlike many cities in Asia, New York has not historically had a broad base of people willing to spend a lot on Chinese food.\n           \n\n            La Chine costs much more than most of them; lamb loin stir-fried with cumin is $38, about twice as much as the fervently admired Muslim lamb chop at Fu Run in Flushing. If you allow the man they call the \u201csake ninja\u201d to talk you into a bottle, you could easily drop $100 or more. (This ninja wears a jacket and tie; he must be working undercover.) But at the risk of undermining my populist credentials, I\u2019d suggest New York could use more Chinese restaurants that are as expensive as our most ambitious French and Italian places. Those restaurants could use more ingredients worth splurging on, and restaurateurs determined to lure talented chefs from China.\n           \n\n            We have Hakkasan, of course, part of a global chain whose crackerjack cooks excel at dim sum but tend to play it safe with other courses. At the two RedFarms, Joe Ng cooks with originality and verve, but the recurring sweetness in the dishes betrays a tailoring of his ideas for perceived American tastes. The cooking at La Chine is something different.\n           \n\n            The menu was devised by the\n            \n             executive chef, Kong Khai Meng\n            \n            . A native of Singapore, he became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the acclaimed chef Jereme Leung before setting up restaurants in hotels around Asia. With Mr. Leung, he worked out his ideas for La Chine, which he executes in the kitchen with\n            \n             David Garcelon\n            \n            , the hotel\u2019s culinary director.\n           \n\n            The restaurant replaces Oscar\u2019s American Brasserie, a glorified coffee shop whose loss did not leave a deep wound in the city\u2019s psyche. The bones of the space have been exposed, the massive pillars and ceiling coffers showing off the hotel\u2019s Art Deco monumentality, though not its Art Deco flourishes. Some tables are set in secluded alcoves at the east end, framed by spidery latticework that evokes carved Chinese screens. A central chandelier, like a huge upside-down wedding cake, shines on vases of orchids whose pinks howl in this room of muted creams and golds.\n           \n\n            The effect would be more stunning if the lighting weren\u2019t so murky; it hovers in the eternal twilight of surgery recovery rooms where patients slip in and out of consciousness. Each time I was about to go under, though, something from the kitchen would bring me back.\n           \n\n            Raw seafood always did it. Sliced yellowtail was fanned out in a pinwheel over Sichuan chile oil. Translucent bands of fluke were darkened by black rice vinegar, China\u2019s answer to balsamic, then touched with hot peony oil, which sizzled and whitened the lean fish as it landed. A long rectangle of bigeye tuna tartare seasoned with soy vinegar was strewn with flowers, herbs, pickled shallots and a stripe of caviar. All three dishes took a modern, Japanese approach to Chinese flavors. All three were very good.\n           \n\n            So was the stack of lightly battered Spanish mackerel delivered under a smoke-filled cloche, like the sturgeon at Eleven Madison Park; the smokiness of the fish was underscored by a smoked soy sauce, appealingly sweet and sticky.\n           \n\n            Broad-bean-fried prawns were juicy and tender-firm inside a crisp, golden coating that flaked into spicy crumbs I couldn\u2019t help eating off the plate.\n           \n\n            Cauliflower was stir-fried with thick bacon slices in a very hot wok that caramelized the bumpy surface to a delicious mottled brown. The snow pea shoots with garlic were as simple, classic and good as any I\u2019ve tasted.\n           \n\n            Everything is served family style except the soups, which ought to be. In individual bowls, they are hard to work into a shared meal, and people may be tempted to skip them. This would be a loss, because they are beautifully made; there\u2019s a clarity to the chicken cloud consomm\u00e9, vividly seasoned with ginger, and a shellfish-drenched power to the \u201ceight hour golden broth,\u201d thick with lobster, crab and scallops.\n           \n\n            Before opening, restaurants now routinely put out photographs of one striking dish, like a band releasing a single to build excitement for an album. For La Chine, this was the barbecued duck. And it is an exciting bird, suffused with five-spice powder and ready to be tucked into griddle-blackened crepes with skinny sticks of cucumber, leek and, surprise, cantaloupe.\n           \n\n            But if anybody had asked, I would have suggested leading with the black-iron tabletop grill that holds a wonderful barbecued collar of Berkshire pork, the meat\u2019s pink edges crackling with a candied honey glaze. (The menu reveals that the honey was secreted by bees who live on the roof, if that appeals to you.) Chicken with cashews may not make a great advertisement for a high-end restaurant, but it\u2019s a great dish, in a kung-pao-style sauce that is keenly balanced between sweet and sour.\n           \n\n            In fact, most of the main courses show off La Chine\u2019s sophistication apart from some subdued seafood dishes. Sous-vide cod with black bean sauce was flabby and, like the scallops in a long canoe-shaped dish with peppers and onions, not a showpiece of sparkling freshness.\n           \n\n            The restaurant\u2019s French name is puzzling until the desserts show up; they are very much in a Western mode. The warm chocolate cake, with sesame ganache melting away inside, has a seductive undertow of spice. The most elaborate and prettiest is the vacherin of passion-fruit cream sandwiched by white spirals of meringue; there\u2019s a white chocolate sphere painted with a metallic swirl like a pink pearl, and a marvelous scoop of sorbet made with fresh lychees. La Chine is far from the realm of fortune cookies, and better off for it.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 276, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/dining/la-chine-review.html", "google_mag": 26.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n            Somebody\u2019s always on the move at\n            \n             La Sirena\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            Trotting up the steps to the entrance above Ninth Avenue. Getting up to say hi to a fellow prowler of the Chelsea galleries. Breezing across a full dining room to exit through a glass door to the terrace.\n           \n\n            Descending from a room in the Maritime Hotel upstairs and settling in for pancakes made with mascarpone and crushed almond cookies after the kitchen opens at 7 a.m. Casing the bar at night. Backing up to frame a picture that will prove they ate at Mario Batali\u2019s new restaurant, his first in New York City since Eataly came along.\n           \n\n            The perpetual motion that supplies a lot of La Sirena\u2019s energy \u2014 the rest comes from the dressy trattoria cooking overseen by Josh Laurano, the executive chef and a partner \u2014 is a function of geography and scale. There are matching north-and-south dining rooms, one near 17th Street and the other over by 16th Street. Each seats about 120 people. In between is a bar with the approximate dimensions of a jet runway. On warm, unrainy days and nights, another 150 or so chairs dot the terrace.\n           \n\n            It\u2019s been easy to forget the excitement of eating in huge, kinetic restaurants lately because so many of them don\u2019t offer much beyond that. The whole genre has gone out of fashion as\n            \n             modest little chef\u2019s lairs\n            \n            have grabbed all the attention. Operations on La Sirena\u2019s scale sometimes get knocked as \u201cbig-box restaurants,\u201d as if any place seating more than 40 people were the equivalent of a Best Buy at the strip mall.\n           \n\n            Some of us hear \u201cbig\u201d and think, \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d And of course, Mr. Batali and his business partner, Joe Bastianich, preside over several restaurants that exemplify the charm of tight downtown rooms where the cooking can get close attention and the menus can have a targeted point of view.\n           \n\n            The one at La Sirena offers a little for everybody except, maybe, the person curious for fresh insights into Italian cuisine. The ground it covers is mostly the middle one. There\u2019s orecchiette with tripe but no lambs\u2019 tongue Jim Harrison (Casa Mono) or pajata finta (Lupa).\n           \n\n            What you notice are not dishes you\u2019ve never seen before but ones you have: hulking meatballs, soft and pale inside with melting grated cheese; braciola, interpreted as braised rolled short ribs in a simple, ripe-red tomato sauce; clams baked under bread crumbs and oregano, jolted with a dab of chopped chiles in oil and a sweet slice of lemon.\n           \n\n            There is, in other words, very little breaking news, but what Mr. Laurano does, he tries to do with care and vigor and enough flourishes to keep your mind from wandering too far. Given the\n            \n             length of the menu\n            \n            and the sheer number of open mouths, though, it was probably inevitable that some dishes would have a certain numbness.\n           \n\n            In one appetizer, pickled anchovies sprawl over variations on fennel: shavings of the raw bulb in lemon and olive oil, other slices browned to a crisp, and fennel pollen, which carries its licorice sweetness around the plate. In another, fat roasted asparagus spears under grated smoked ricotta are piled over a cushion of cacio whipped with egg. Both are generous in size and flavor.\n           \n\n            Lasagna is layered with al dente wheels of waxy potato and a pesto as vibrant as if the basil had been picked 10 minutes ago. Tomatoes braised with spare ribs make a compelling sauce of ridged mini-torpedoes of cavatelli. Bucatini with bites of octopus, right on the border between firm and tender, have a tomato sauce with that low murmur of chile heat Mr. Batali\u2019s restaurants are so adept at delivering.\n           \n\n            Servers like to recommend a half-portion each of two different pastas for $24. Take them up on it, and don\u2019t be alarmed if they offer an opinion on whether your two choices work together. Mine always did.\n           \n\n            Mr. Laurano gives the main courses layers of complexity that go beyond standard trattoria cooking. The approach pays off for the lamb chops with a sweet-sour pomegranate molasses sauce and round chickpea-flour fritters, and for the grilled swordfish in a Sicilian tomato sauce with capers, olives, pine nuts and currants.\n           \n\n            When main dishes falter, it\u2019s not because they\u2019re too simple. It wasn\u2019t pickled fennel that kept me from finishing a pork chop Milanese. It was the breading, thick and dense in a way that made me think of the apron you wear when you get your teeth X-rayed. The problem with porchetta alla Romana wasn\u2019t the generous seasoning but the blubbery wrapper of under-rendered pork belly. And some fine, creamy white beans couldn\u2019t disguise how little flavor there was in a baton of rabbit fried in bread crumbs.\n           \n\n            This kind of difficulty was rare among the pastas, although linguine with clams was pure Mulberry Street, a mop of bland noodles come to rest in a slosh of thin, salty sauce.\n           \n\n            In Michael Laiskonis\u2019s desserts, there\u2019s nothing but sophisticated pleasure. The baba is a citrus-soaked spongecake turned pink with Campari. The semifreddo looks like a baked alaska, a hedgehog of browned meringue around blood orange sorbet with a frozen core of honey nougat.\n           \n\n            Many servers in neckties and long black aprons traverse the multiple chambers of this restaurant. On a night when my table seemed to be the focus of special attention, I looked and saw neckties and aprons at the other tables, too. The staff never stood still, it seemed, until I got up and walked to the south dining room.\n           \n\n            Half a dozen servers stood idle in the middle of the room, as if on a smokeless cigarette break.\n           \n\n            It\u2019s hard to keep all the billiard balls in motion at once. Even when they\u2019re moving, it\u2019s not easy to make them roll in the right direction, as Mr. Batali and I discussed in an email exchange after somebody on his staff served breadsticks to my son, who, we\u2019d explained to two of our servers, has a serious sesame allergy.\n           \n\n            La Sirena\u2019s bread is covered with sesame seeds, and the breadsticks were offered to him as a substitute. This was a well-meaning gesture, but they contained sesame seeds on the inside, as my son figured out after his mouth started to itch.\n           \n\n            This was a serious mistake, and dining room managers compounded it when they expressed concern without trying to find out exactly what had happened.\n           \n\n            Mr. Batali emailed me later that night. After I described the episode and let him know that the reaction had subsided before it got serious, he replied that he was apologetic and frustrated. His company,\n            \n             B&B Hospitality Group\n            \n            , has a full-time specialist in safety and environmental concerns who instructs all the food handlers on allergy protocols. After the incident at my table, Mr. Laurano also met with the staff to review procedures.\n           \n\n            As a parent, I was happy with that response. As a critic, I\u2019ll keep an eye on the tendency toward entropy of large organizations. On a later visit, without my son, our server spent a long time going over the menu and taking our order. Two minutes later, he was back from the kitchen, looking a little embarrassed.\n           \n\n            \u201cI forgot to ask,\u201d he said. \u201cAre there any food allergies at the table?\u201d\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 277, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/08/dining/la-sirena-restaurant-review.html", "google_mag": 25.5}, {"review_text": "\n            The last time I reviewed\n            \n             the Beatrice Inn\n            \n            , the going was tough. Formerly a nightclub that reliably infuriated its neighbors in the West Village, the place had just been rehabilitated by new owners, including the magazine editor Graydon Carter, who\n            \n             envisioned a chophouse\n            \n            of old-establishment sensibilities.\n           \n\n            They were on their third chef by the time\n            \n             I wrote it up\n            \n            with a Satisfactory rating, in the spring of 2013. All three had obvious talent. As far as I could tell, they were just having trouble making food that was as dull as the owners wanted.\n           \n\n            The restaurant hired its fourth chef later that year. Her name is\n            \n             Angie Mar\n            \n            . A dinner there not long after she took over convinced me that the kitchen was moving in the right direction, but it did not hint that she would eventually make the Beatrice Inn into a meat lover\u2019s palace with a menu unlike any other in the city.\n           \n\n            Ms. Mar, who bought the restaurant over the summer, still calls it a chophouse, but it is no longer a place where cautious eaters seek refuge from the unknown. Her Beatrice Inn offers an irresistible opportunity to take chances and eat with abandon.\n           \n\n            She refers to the past, all right; the restaurant is big on vintage silver tongs and serving spoons whose patterns glint in the low light. But Ms. Mar isn\u2019t looking for safety. She\u2019s mining history for neglected pleasures and forgotten indulgences.\n           \n\n            A quick look at the menu tells you the direction her kitchen obsessions take. The main courses are divided into \u201cOf the Land\u201d (12 choices) and \u201cFrom the Sea\u201d (two). A couple of the meat dishes are said to serve two people, others are meant for two to four, and the tomahawk rib-eye roasted on a bone the size of a cricket bat is simply listed as \u201cfor the table.\u201d\n           \n\n            When an animal can be cooked and served in one piece, that is what Ms. Mar will do. There is a whole rabbit smoked over apple wood, giving it the flavor of meat wrapped in bacon and roasted, except that the smoke goes all the way down to the bone.\n           \n\n            Ducks, meanwhile, are cured in salt for four days, then smoked, then slowly roasted, then doused with flaming booze at the table. The skin is dark, and the meat is pink and pull-apart tender; it reminded me of a slow-cooked Easter ham.\n           \n\n            The entire-animal approach is not restricted to animals. A side dish on a recent night was a carnival squash, roasted whole and carved at the table, like a chicken.\n           \n\n            Knowing all this, I should have been ready for the cheese incident. Before dessert one night, a server brought out a platter with an ash-coated pyramid of Valen\u00e7ay, a white and gently slumping wheel of a Rensselaer County triple cream, and a stack of shaggy leaves of clothbound Cheddar, each with its own jam or honey. We said we\u2019d like some of the Valen\u00e7ay.\n           \n\n            \u201cYou realize that you\u2019ll be getting that whole pyramid, right?\u201d our server asked. We hadn\u2019t, but we were game (though it would have been nice if he had warned us that we\u2019d pay $38 for it).\n           \n\n            Or you could just get a burger. The patties are tall, firm and moist with fat in the style of\n            \n             the Spotted Pig\n            \n            , where Ms. Mar used to cook. The ones in the dining room are made from beef aged for a month and a half. Lamb burgers are sold at the bar, where you can also get a manhattan served inside a crystal candy jar that the bartender has filled with a cloud of wood smoke.\n           \n\n            But the best chef-engineered burger can\u2019t hold my attention the way a really good classic stew does. My last time at the bar, I sat down in front of half a dozen Nova Scotia oysters followed by a hulking stump of oxtail braised in Madeira. I ate the beef with a spoon, as I\u2019d been instructed, scooping up the juices and stewed prunes and honest-to-goodness mashed potatoes. Enjoy your burgers, kids.\n           \n\n            Ms. Mar brings back champvallon de t\u00eate, an old French artillery piece in the battle against hunger. Beef cheeks and veal are braised separately and then, when they have reached different forms of seductiveness, combined with chanterelles and porcini. The whole stew is then baked under a thin fan of sliced potatoes. It is like shepherd\u2019s pie cooked by very happy shepherds.\n           \n\n            The game pie is very much in the same vein, although here the stew is a mix of venison, lamb and boar. The only true game animal is the boar, but Ms. Mar coaxes a brawny flavor, not fully tamed, from the combination of meats. The crust, an expanse of golden suet pastry, was a little tough the night I ate it, but I\u2019d rather have an overworked suet crust than no suet crust at all.\n           \n\n            On another night, the suet crust under a savory tart of fall plums was much more tender, though there was still room for improvement. Pastry is not the kitchen\u2019s strong suit. One of two desserts is a fried pie whose apple filling was jarringly oversalted on a recent night. The better choice, and really the only choice if you have bought into the Mar aesthetic, is the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e in a marrow bone. It is lovely and weird, the familiar custard supplemented with a flavor that is unmistakably animal.\n           \n\n            Ms. Mar cooks animals, of course, but she also cooks for animals. She cooks for the animals that we are. She knows we have powerful senses of smell, that we can be led by our appetites, that certain instincts kick in when we sit together taking another animal apart.\n           \n\n            In many ways, the Beatrice Inn resembles a steakhouse, but Ms. Mar has given it a strong undertow of sensuality that would be unwelcome in most steakhouses, where the rites of male bonding are well established and don\u2019t encourage unexpected detours into pleasure. In fact, the restaurant is one of the few meat joints in town that doesn\u2019t seem to be pitched to men.\n           \n\n            Not all of Ms. Mar\u2019s obsessions strike me as wise. Her bourbon-aged rib-eye, based on a technique she learned from the French butcher Yves-Marie Le Bourdonnec in which beef is kept wrapped in whiskey-soaked cloth for more than a hundred days, tasted to me like a very expensive hangover.\n           \n\n            But she has a vision. A vision isn\u2019t the same as a concept. In the restaurant business, a concept is a market niche, while a vision can lead beyond the bounds of business sense, or any other kind. Ms. Mar might draw more customers if she didn\u2019t seem to look down on vegetables, for instance.\n           \n\n            If that\u2019s not a deal breaker for you, though, her cooking will seem especially wonderful because it\u2019s so clear that she believes in what she\u2019s doing. By following her gut, she has made the Beatrice Inn one of the most celebratory restaurants in the city. I don\u2019t mean that you should go there to celebrate an anniversary or a new job. It\u2019s a place to go when you want to celebrate your life as an animal.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 278, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/dining/beatrice-inn-review.html", "google_mag": 24.399999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n            Imagine the restaurant Wolfgang Puck might have opened if he had wafted into New York in the 1980s on warm, mesquite-scented Southern California breezes.\n           \n\n            In that era, Mr. Puck was a nonstop innovator. He turned the Sunset Strip on to\n            \n             duck-sausage pizzas\n            \n            and other exercises in treating Italian cuisine as a blank slate at\n            \n             Spago\n            \n            . He hipped Santa Monica to\n            \n             Chinese-style fried catfish with Japanese ponzu\n            \n            at\n            \n             Chinois on Main\n            \n            , the kind of crossbreeding we would learn to call Asian fusion. Above all, by the end of the decade, he had shown chefs the way to scrub the starch out of their restaurants and still be taken seriously.\n           \n\n            All of these ideas would hitch rides to New York sooner or later, but Mr. Puck could have given us a peek into the future of dining if he had come to town in those days. It never happened. Aside from opening a\n            \n             kiosk\n            \n            at Kennedy Airport about a decade ago, he stayed away until September, when he opened a steak-driven restaurant in the financial district.\n           \n\n            Nothing on the menu at\n            \n             Cut by Wolfgang Puck\n            \n            breaks new ground. It sits on the ground floor of the new\n            \n             Four Seasons Hotel New York Downtown\n            \n            , to allow both operations their full, overtaxed names. (There are five other Cut restaurants flung across the world.)\n           \n\n            The steaks, presented bare, on white plates, are excellent. Appetizers and other dishes are appealing, if a little unfocused. The food is served in rooms whose design, by\n            \n             Strata Architects\n            \n            and\n            \n             Jacques Garcia\n            \n            , appears to have been lost in the mail for a decade or so. It is a new restaurant that already feels dated.\n           \n\n            To the right of the glass doors on Church Street is an entryway framed by fold upon fold of shimmery red fabric, suggesting that you are about to walk into a room full of\n            \n             elegantly debauched vampires\n            \n            . Instead you find hotel guests and solitary men in an awkward lounge illuminated by slashing bolts of red neon lightning; it\u2019s how you\u2019d imagine a sexy downtown bar if you\u2019d never been downtown, gone to a bar or had sex.\n           \n\n            To the left of the entrance is the main dining room, its rear wall given entirely over to a diptych by a young, fast-climbing artist named\n            \n             Alex Israel\n            \n            . Each half of the work features text in sans-serif block capitals, in the manner of\n            \n             Barbara Kruger\n            \n            , but instead of spooky aphorisms about power, we get cheese-ball romantic comedy dialogue superimposed on pink fireworks:\n           \n\n            \u201c\u2018Sometimes you know it in your head,\u2019 the chef whispered.\u201d\n           \n\n            \u201c\u2018Sometimes you feel it in your stomach,\u2019 she smiled, buzzed.\u201d\n           \n\n            Sometimes you gag in your mouth, the critic sighed.\n           \n\n            Early in the meal, a short glass vase arrives at the table loaded with Parmesan-crusted breadsticks about a yard long. They always seem to be aimed straight at my face, as if challenging me to a duel.\n           \n\n            They do taste good, though, and the sharp, creamy goug\u00e8res that show up next are terrific. While we\u2019re looking at our menus, somebody stands next to the table holding a white china platter arrayed with cuts of Wagyu beef wrapped in black napkins. Each hunk of muscle is pointed out and described appreciatively. There is less ceremony when you buy a diamond at Tiffany.\n           \n\n            Some pride in these steaks is understandable, particularly in the case of the Japanese beef. Imported from Miyazaki Prefecture, this is true Wagyu, rarely offered in American restaurants. It is rich in a way that\u2019s hard to fathom, the melting streaks of fat cascading from the flesh onto your tongue.\n           \n\n            It is sold at $25 an ounce. I can\u2019t stand pointlessly expensive luxuries, but this one has a point. The beef is so rich that a table of curious diners for whom the price is not an automatic deal breaker might share a six-ounce steak, the smallest cut offered.\n           \n\n            I am less inclined to splurge on the hybrid Wagyu raised in Idaho, with its broader, less graceful flavor and noticeably less marbling. Next to the genuine article, it tastes like a compromise.\n           \n\n            Of course there are normal American steaks, too, from three sources. One night, I ran a controlled study on two of the rib-eyes, both of them cornfed. While I was taking apart a steak from Kansas that had been aged for 28 days in vacuum-sealed plastic, a guest ate one raised in Illinois that had been dry aged for 35 days. The contrast kept us trading slices all night. Mine was chewier, more purple, a little more concentrated, with a potent red-meat flavor. The other exemplified the old-fashioned American ideal: soft, pinkish, mild and shiny with rendered fat.\n           \n\n            Cut uses a technique for cooking its varieties of beef that I strongly endorse. Steaks are grilled over wood and charcoal and then blasted under a broiler running at 1,200 degrees, roughly hot enough to melt aluminum. The meat arrives with a textured, almost brittle outer bark, like the crust on a really great loaf of sourdough.\n           \n\n            Old-guard steakhouses are losing their juice these days because well-connected chefs like Mr. Puck can often buy better, more flavorful beef. Other ingredients at Cut are enviable, too. The tender and herbaceous double chops of lamb come from\n            \n             Elysian Fields Farm\n            \n            in Pennsylvania, and two preparations of bay scallops out of Nantucket popped up, near the start of their brief, glorious season in November.\n           \n\n            Very little about the menu says steakhouse aside from the steaks. Cut is not a wedge-salad joint. The executive chef, Raymond Weber, who comes to New York from the Cut in Dubai, makes elaborate new dishes alongside vintage ones from the first Cut restaurant, in Beverly Hills. Impressively tender and flavorful veal tongue with artichokes and white beans was served at the original from the start, and it is worth repeating. So is the lobster and crab Louis, the chilled shellfish set over a coaster of panna cotta pointedly spiked with horseradish.\n           \n\n            A few dishes fail to land their punches. A bone-marrow flan, meant to be spread on toasted brioche with a savory mushroom marmalade, was very delicate but didn\u2019t taste much like marrow. Steamed salmon with snow peas and spicy soy sauce reminded me of all the perfunctory, umpteenth-generation Asian fusion dishes that made everybody lose interest in the genre.\n           \n\n            The pastry chef is Zairah Molina, another Puck veteran. Like the rest of the kitchen, her department can overcomplicate its plates. But she always puts a good idea at the center, like the crisp membrillo-stuffed fritters dusted with cardamom sugar next to a spoonful of kabocha ice cream that she was serving last month.\n           \n\n            Except for the art, nothing about Cut is less than good. But a lot of it isn\u2019t very inspired, either. The Wolfgang Puck in charge here is the proficient overseer of high-end hotel amenities, not the chef who crossed boundaries and defined an earlier era. If 80 percent of success is just showing up, as Woody Allen has said, a good chunk of the remainder is arriving at the right time.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 279, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/20/dining/cut-by-wolfgang-puck-review.html", "google_mag": 27.399999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n            Consider the chicken. Consider each part of the chicken. Consider eating each part of the chicken, one after another, grilled over charcoal at a yakitori restaurant called\n            \n             Torishin\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            Dark neck meat first, gathered in a ruffle around a bamboo skewer. When stuck to its long root of bone, the neck is picky business to eat, but it is full of flavor when it is pared away and the outer bits are singed over charcoal and the fat starts to spill over the rest.\n           \n\n            Now the tenderloin. Many tenderloins come to an ignominious end as \u201ctenders,\u201d encased in bread crumbs in the ketchup-smeared fingers of a toddler. But grilled lightly, so they firm up without scorching, they run with delicate pink juices.\n           \n\n            Livers, of course, are seared very fast so they don\u2019t get leathery. The rich, red insides are as soft as yogurt. They take well to a few grains of ground sansho pepper, enough to spark a slow buzz on the tongue. So do the hearts, done medium-rare, like steak.\n           \n\n            On the bird\u2019s back, above the tail feathers, are the oysters. At Torishin they go under their French name, sot-l\u2019y-laisse \u2014 \u201ca fool leaves it.\u201d They are grilled with their skin, which puckers and hisses and goes from creamy blue to gold.\n           \n\n            For all I know the first yakitori chefs in Japan had nothing but efficiency in mind when they speared each anatomical bit on its own skewer. Fast-cooking livers can be pulled from the grill to make space, while other pieces take their time.\n           \n\n            In the hands of the attentive chefs at Torishin, this technique produces something beyond convenience. Cooked separately, each part has a different pleasure to offer. Some you chew, and some you crackle. Some have cerebral appeal, others call to instinct.\n           \n\n            The house style is sensitive to timing, averse to charring and careful with seasoning. The chicken is salted, brushed with a sauce called tare, which is less sweet at Torishin than at some other yakitori specialists, and grilled about an inch above long-burning sticks of binchotan, a Japanese charcoal. The cooks wave bamboo fans at the fire when it needs a boost.\n           \n\n            Sitting on the tables and counters are vaguely humanoid gourds filled with sansho and the spice blend shichimi, as well as pitchers of soy sauce.\n           \n\n            \u201cWhich skewers are good with soy?\u201d I asked Atsushi Kono, the chef, one night when he was tending the coals.\n           \n\n            His head bobbed noncommittally before he said, \u201cIt\u2019s there for people who think they want it.\u201d Right, then. No soy.\n           \n\n            With minimalist cooking, the distance between dull and delicious can sometimes be measured in grains of salt. This became clear during my only meal at Torishin\u2019s original location, on First Avenue in the 60s.\n           \n\n            There were many skewers. None of them seemed to have been seasoned. Even the pickled cucumbers and daikon that showed up at the start of the meal seemed to be under orders not to draw any attention to themselves. I knew that some people revered the restaurant, so I just figured that it fell into one of my blind spots.\n           \n\n            When Torishin moved to its current address in Hell\u2019s Kitchen in 2015, I did not exactly rush over on my hoverboard. In fact, I didn\u2019t make it there until last fall, a delay I regretted as soon as I had unskewered my first lump of chicken. Whatever had been missing from the chicken before was there, and it\u2019s been there each time I\u2019ve gone back. (I still think the pickles need more pep, though.)\n           \n\n            To the left as you enter is a small bar. The bartenders spend the quiet hours whittling big ice cubes into spheres, with knives. These rough globes are plopped into tumblers of shochu, and if you want to learn about this distilled spirit, Torishin is a fine place to start. The sake list is compact but varied. The few wines come from big, obvious names.\n           \n\n            At the end of a winding corridor is a split-level dining room. The mezzanine might be the spot for privacy. The lower space is more active, with seating at tables or around a U-shaped counter that hugs the open kitchen and a grill, the depth of a single skewer.\n           \n\n            If you know your favorite bird bits, ordering \u00e0 la carte is simple enough. The menu is helpfully illustrated, from neck to tail. All but one of the skewers is under $10, and the package of seven chicken skewers plus three vegetables is a good deal at $65.\n           \n\n            But Torishin always puts me in the mood for surprises, so I like to ask for an omakase menu. The grill cooks serve up a mix of vegetables (the mushrooms are a particular treat, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to grill zucchini better than Torishin does); white meat (the piece wrapped in a shiso leaf and dabbed with salty plum paste is a nearly perfect bite); dark meat (chicken legs can be subdivided in more ways than you might think); and curiosities called \u201cspecial skewers.\u201d This is where you will find the oysters, the kidneys, the nugget of meat from the base of the wing, the wrinkly and fatty neck skin, the smooth and supple belly skin.\n           \n\n            Most of the surprises have been positive, like \u201cknee gristle.\u201d What about \u201cmain artery\u201d? The nicest thing I can honestly say about this blood vessel, which ties the heart to some other vital organ, is that it is, in fact, edible.\n           \n\n            If hunger still calls after you have stripped all the bamboo sticks and left them standing in the ceramic cup in front of you, there is an excellent remedy in the form of oyako-don. A homey dish of chicken and egg over white rice, oyako-don can be filling or it can be almost ethereal, as it is at Torishin.\n           \n\n            To one side of the passage from bar to dining room is a narrow nook behind curtains. Inside is an eight-seat bar, called the Select Counter, where Mr. Kono presides over extended menus that borrow from the kaiseki tradition. One recent meal began with a tiny simmered octopus with peppery sansho leaves. Sashimi followed. Chicken breast was steamed in cherry leaves and served with cucumber wheels and fresh shoots of spring ginger; the flavor was lovely and transient, one of those Japanese miracles of putting the mood of a season on the plate.\n           \n\n            The $150 menu came with a complete fusillade of skewers as well as a choice of grilled luxury items: either Kumamoto beef (not as meltingly rich as it could have been) or king crab leg (smeared with some funky stuff from inside the crab\u2019s head, and completely delicious).\n           \n\n            If Mr. Kono had kept cooking all night, I would have been happy, but to experience Torishin you don\u2019t need to spend $150 and a couple of hours. Just a few skewers are enough to expand your sense of what\u2019s possible in the department of chicken.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 280, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/dining/torishin-review-japanese-yakitori.html", "google_mag": 30.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n            Keith McNally switched on the lights of his latest restaurant,\n            \n             Augustine\n            \n            , on the first day of November.

They will notice the accustomed stemware, sturdy and utilitarian, for wines that run the gamut from very good to good enough. They will take it all in, the distinctive blend of the louche and the meticulous, and say to themselves, Mr. McNally has\n            \n             done it again\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            What he has done again is to borrow the tricks of successful genre fiction. As with a new Patricia Cornwell novel, everybody knows the template but shows up to see what\u2019s different and what\u2019s the same this time around. There have to be some fresh elements, or else why bother? But they have to be applied in ways that don\u2019t change how the engine functions.\n           \n\n            This means avoiding self-consciously arty cooking \u2014 \u201ccuisine\u201d \u2014 at all costs. In a genre exercise, the addition of art just gums up the pistons. If the machinery in a McNally restaurant slows down too much, people may start to notice that his template foregrounds his habitual strengths while sweeping weaknesses, such as the occasional spottiness of Augustine\u2019s food, into the shadows.\n           \n\n            By unanimous consent, atmosphere is Mr. McNally\u2019s great, almost unrivaled strength. Just as the James Bond movies move from one location to another, all of which feel exactly like Bond movie locations, Mr. McNally\u2019s dining rooms are all different and yet somehow the same. He excels at building rooms that evoke vintage Paris \u2014 not exactly the real Paris, but the city the way you remember it a year after taking a vacation there.\n           \n\n            Augustine has the prettiest, giddiest interior he\u2019s ever done. It\u2019s a space that makes you feel, as Holly Golightly put it, as if nothing very bad could happen to you there. Painted glazed tiles are set so that vines and stalks of flowers \u2014 tiger lilies, chrysanthemums, peonies, poppies \u2014 seem to climb the walls; more tiles place pink and white cockatoos up in the crown molding. It\u2019s like a garden out of Fragonard, and while the 21st-century customers don\u2019t quite look like French aristocrats, at least their hard modern edges will be blurred away by an impossibly warm honey-colored light.\n           \n\n            Augustine\u2019s Parisian flashback mood is so successful that it doesn\u2019t matter whether the food resembles anything you might eat in Paris itself. Beef, which can be hit or miss in France, is one of the most reliable choices on a McNally menu. At Augustine, there is a lot of it. Grilled steaks get their own menu heading \u2014 grillades. One of them is a filet mignon au poivre, but even my T-bone was sheathed in cracked peppercorns. The meat had the density and force imparted by dry aging, and was tender without being floppy.\n           \n\n            The obligatory steak frites has been exiled to the entree section. It is agreeably muscular and chewy, and served with amber-gold fries that are a perfect illustration of what may be the McNally Doctrine: Restaurants don\u2019t need to do new things if they do the old things right.\n           \n\n            The leg of lamb has not been reinvented. Having spun on a rotisserie under a coat of herbs, it is carved off in long strips, like shawarma, and draped over very soft flageolets. A cheese souffl\u00e9 appetizer recalls the warm pot de fromage at Cherche Midi; it\u2019s delicious, even if it is breadier than a classic souffl\u00e9, more like a Gruy\u00e8re-and-Parmesan popover.\n           \n\n            On Mondays, you can get a bowl of fine, fattish mussels in coconut milk with lemongrass, like a tribute to Jean-Georges Vongerichten in the\n            \n             Vong\n            \n            era. At lunch, there is a lobster roll that Mr. McBride and Mr. Parilla have the good sense to serve warm, dressed just with lemon and melted butter, the way you\u2019d eat it on the Connecticut coast.\n           \n\n            At lunch or at dinner, somebody will be eating a burger, a richly dripping hulk of meat under melted Comt\u00e9 and onions cooked with Scotch. It shows up at the table with a shot of bourbon. The Scotch does more for the onions than the bourbon does for the burger. On the other hand, a shot of bourbon is just as welcome with a burger as it would be with any number of other purchases \u2014 haircuts, MetroCards, the morning paper.\n           \n\n            When invention does rear its head, the results are not always spectacular. What dark urge led the chefs to foie gras Augustine, thin slices of foie gras terrine scattered with chopped green beans and artichokes barigoule? And is there a way to get it de-Augustined?\n           \n\n            The steak tartare has been chopped to a pulp and then sent to Japan, with flakes of nori and a dose of yuzukosho that overpowered the meat on the day I had it. And while prunes are wonderful soaked in Armagnac, it turns out that when they are also incorporated into the pastry cream of a mille-feuille, they just muddy up the production.\n           \n\n            This was the only squishy spot on the dessert menu, though. Darkly caramelized apples, wound in a spiral and set on a crumbly hazelnut crust, make up the excellent tarte Tatin. Baba au rhum can be a fire-breathing beast, but the one at Augustine, soaked in an orange-scented syrup before it\u2019s showered with rum, is sweet and gentle.\n           \n\n            As with any good genre piece, some details have been changed, but the formula remains intact; things fall into place, and yet nobody appears to have been trying too hard. That\u2019s another advantage of conspicuously avoiding serious cuisine: If anybody points out an imperfection, you can say, \u201cLook, it\u2019s just dinner.\u201d This is not the worst philosophy for a restaurant.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 282, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/28/dining/augustine-review-french-food-nyc-keith-mcnally.html", "google_mag": 25.299999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n            Our server at\n            \n             Gr\u00fcnauer Bistro\n            \n            called the men at our table Sir. When one of the women asked for a glass of water, he replied, with deep seriousness and an Austrian accent, \u201cMadame, consider it done.\u201d He set off deliberately, his chest billowing before him and his feet moving with slow, battle-weary pride. A few minutes later, he returned.\n           \n\n            \u201cThere you are, Madame,\u201d he said. \u201cAs fast as I could.\u201d\n           \n\n            Once he had hauled away the dessert dishes \u2014 by that time, we had reduced the Sacher torte to a rubble of dark crumbs and the palatschinken folded over chestnut mousse to a few stray smudges of chocolate sauce \u2014 he came back with a bottle and four glasses. The clear spirit he poured was a pear-apple brandy from Austria.\n           \n\n            After a sip, one of the women said it reminded her of grappa. He lifted his chin and gave an indulgent chuckle. In that laugh was compressed the entire history of Austria\u2019s contributions to European culture.\n           \n\n            \u201cYes, Madame,\u201d he said. \u201cBut \u2026 more refined.\u201d\n           \n\n            He was so perfect for Gr\u00fcnauer Bistro, and Gr\u00fcnauer Bistro was so perfect for him, that it\u2019s impossible to imagine a time when they hadn\u2019t been together. The whole restaurant is like that. Although it opened in early March, it might have been frying Wiener schnitzel and simmering tafelspitz on the corner of First Avenue and 82nd Street for decades.\n           \n\n            More than I would have thought possible, Gr\u00fcnauer Bistro seems to be a holdout from Yorkville\u2019s past, when businesses fed the Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Austrian and German immigrants who lived side by side in microneighborhoods that replicated the arrangement of Mitteleuropa.\n           \n\n            I could believe that Gr\u00fcnauer Bistro was founded the same year as\n            \n             Elk Candy\n            \n            , a German confectioner who formed tiny carrots, pigs and strawberries out of marzipan. That it had outlived Mrs. Herbst\u2019s, baker of a Hungarian cabbage strudel that Nora Ephron once called\n            \n             \u201calmost the only thing I remember about my first marriage.\u201d\n            \n            That it once competed for expatriates with\n            \n             the Viennese Lantern\n            \n            , where diners were serenaded by a strolling fiddler, a strolling accordionist and a lyric soprano or two, firmly planted.\n           \n\n            Gr\u00fcnauer Bistro is a quieter spot. Late on Thursday nights, a pianist works the baby grand by the bar. On other nights, customers have to make do with a poster-size photograph of a fiddler hanging on the wall, the gilded statue of Johann Strauss II in Vienna.\n           \n\n            The picture helps brighten the spirit of a dining room that tends toward contemplative twilight. A sunset glow emanates from the coffered ceiling panels. Wood needs time to look this warm, and I wasn\u2019t surprised to hear that the ceiling was inherited from\n            \n             Primavera\n            \n            , the Italian restaurant that sat on this corner for 32 years. When he took over the address, Peter Gr\u00fcnauer must have realized that any restaurant built under that ceiling would appear long established.\n           \n\n            He is long established himself, having made his name in Manhattan in the late 1970s and \u201980s as the owner of Vienna 79. That restaurant made Austrian cooking waltz to the tune of nouvelle cuisine. What this meant was \u201clightening up on fats and flour\u201d and \u201cgarnishing dishes with an unusual rainbow of bright steamed and saut\u00e9ed vegetables,\u201d Mimi Sheraton wrote in\n            \n             her four-star review\n            \n            in 1981.\n           \n\n            Not much about the traditional cooking under Thomas Slivovsky, Gr\u00fcnauer Bistro\u2019s chef, could be called nouvelle, but ghosts of Vienna 79 whisper in the kitchen. Dill-strewn bands of house-cured gravlax with whole-grain mustard sauce reappear, and are worth getting. Applesauce cut with horseradish still makes an interesting complement to the tafelspitz, beef braised to tenderness with root vegetables in a light broth.\n           \n\n            Beef consomm\u00e9 with the sharp nip of black pepper is filled out by browned ribbons of crepes rather than the liver dumplings of old. Goulash here is made with beef, not veal, but it still comes with buttered spaetzle that squiggle their way into the meaty, paprika-choked sauce. Oddly, the spaetzle tossed with herbs, vegetables and a squirt of lemon as a vegetarian main course were less tender and appealing the night I tried them.\n           \n\n            There is Wiener schnitzel, of course. There has to be Wiener schnitzel, and it has to come with lingonberries (intact and not too sweet), potato salad (on the mild, creamy side) and marinated cucumber slices (classic). And if on some nights the rippled crust over the tender veal cutlet doesn\u2019t crunch quite as emphatically as you want it to, it may be that the kitchen is simply trying to play along with the illusion that everybody at Gr\u00fcnauer Bistro has been doing this for so long that imperfections are to be expected once in a while. You could draw the same conclusion about the somewhat dry chunks of white meat in chicken paprikash.\n           \n\n            As for unusual rainbows of vegetables, the closest the menu comes is the vinegared beets in several colors, with big white puffs of whipped goat cheese. But it\u2019s a very nice salad.\n           \n\n            At an Austrian restaurant, the desserts had better be good. For the most part, they are. The shell of pastry wrapped around apple strudel was damp one night, but flaky and crisp on another. More notable \u2014 ridiculously good, actually \u2014 was the kaiserschmarrn, a dense, eggy pancake broken into pieces that were white with powdered sugar and stained dark by fruit compote.\n           \n\n            A server always asked whether we wanted coffee, from the Viennese roaster Julius Meinl, during dessert or after. It\u2019s a small detail that helps set the Old World tone.\n           \n\n            \u201cAustrian vineyards offer lean pickings for wine lovers,\u201d Ms. Sheraton wrote in 1981. In this case, the outlook has improved. The list is full of reds and whites from notable producers including Prager, Nikolaihof and F. X. Pichler. Most of the bottles are under $70. There are also some Austrian wines that Mr. Gr\u00fcnauer, who runs\n            \n             another Gr\u00fcnauer Bistro\n            \n            in Kansas City, Mo., has commissioned under his own label.\n           \n\n            Each of my meals ended with the same ritual, a bottle of pear-apple brandy poured out for everybody at the table. I don\u2019t believe the restaurant had spotted the critic; the gift simply seemed to be an acknowledgment that we had shown heroic appetites. Once, we supplemented the brandy with a single $25 glass of\n            \n             Hans Reisetbauer\u2019\n            \n            s astonishing carrot eau de vie.\n           \n\n            It tasted like carrots, but more refined.\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 283, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/22/dining/grunauer-bistro-review.html", "google_mag": 23.799999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n         The smallest blackout I\u2019ve ever lived through was limited to the interior of a Thai restaurant on Spring Street, just off the Bowery, named\n         \n          Uncle Boons\n         \n         , where early one night the electricity kept cutting out, then flicking back on a few minutes later. Almost every foot of wall space is covered with pictures that might have been picked up at a Bangkok flea market: portraits of Thailand\u2019s kings, thrift-store paintings, prints of jungle beasts, a monster-movie poster in Thai and semi-English (\u201cOnce again dinosaur shake the erath!\u201d). But staging a Southeast Asian power failure seemed to be taking the conceit a bit far.\n        \n\n         We didn\u2019t stop eating, though. I would bring my own generator if that\u2019s what it took to finish the mee krob with fried sweetbreads. In many Thai restaurants in the United States, the fried noodles in mee krob are dispatched into dissolved brown sugar with trace amounts of fish sauce and lime juice. The result is as interesting as spaghetti in pancake syrup. The sauce at Uncle Boons, which starts with tamarind pulp and palm sugar, was rounded and rich and deeply engaging.\n        \n\n         And a little thing like iffy wiring wouldn\u2019t keep me away from the yum kai hua pli, a salad of warm roasted chicken torn and tossed with crunchy threads of sliced banana blossoms. The chicken would have been great by itself, but it was the dressing that helped it shine through the power failure: warm coconut milk soured with lime juice and spiced with dried chiles to an intensity that I think of as handkerchief-hot.\n        \n\n         Uncle Boons must have fixed its electrical troubles, because they did not recur. What did return was my excitement at tasting Thai flavors so fresh and dynamic.\n        \n\n         The restaurant has less in common with Queens Thai dynamos like\n         \n          Ayada\n         \n         ,\n         \n          Sripraphai\n         \n         , tiny\n         \n          Chao Thai\n         \n         or its roomier spinoff\n         \n          Chao Thai Too\n         \n         than it does with\n         \n          Pok Pok Ny\n         \n         , Andy Ricker\u2019s place on the Brooklyn waterfront. A few of its tricks might have been lifted from Mr. Ricker\u2019s backpack. There is the charcoal grill, visible behind a glass wall at the end of the bar. There is the tight menu that doesn\u2019t give you the choice of chicken, beef, pork, shrimp or squid with almost every curry, a concession that holds back some of the best Thai restaurants.\n        \n\n         Both places look like dark, woody Thai pubs, right down to their motorized ice buckets that shake bottles of Singha until they turn into alcoholic slush that you drink through a straw. (It won\u2019t be the best beer you\u2019ve ever had, but it may be the coldest.) Pok Pok Ny follows through with many other wacky and excellent Thai beverages, while the drinks are Uncle Boons\u2019s prime blind spot. Neither of the two cocktails is a complete triumph, and even the iced tea with sweetened condensed milk tastes watery.\n        \n\n         But Uncle Boons has many charms all its own. The owners and chefs, Ann Redding and her husband, Matt Danzer, met while working as cooks at\n         \n          Per Se\n         \n         , and the marks of Thomas Keller\u2019s ballet academy are far more visible than you\u2019d expect at a place that plays warbly Thai covers of \u201cAnother Brick in the Wall\u201d and \u201cHang On, Sloopy.\u201d\n        \n\n         The tables are set with folded cotton napkins and traditional brass forks and spoons from Thailand. Three months after the restaurant opened, the dining room staff is already quite polished, poised and welcoming. The third time the lights went out, a server brought every table an unnecessary but delicious little apology, a plate of mieng kum, little one-bite snacks.\n        \n\n         Mounded on a soft, fresh betel leaf are fresh ginger, coconut, dried shrimp, peanuts and very hot chiles. You dab on some shrimp-paste sauce, fold the leaf over and pop it into your mouth, and right away your taste buds spring to attention. It\u2019s a preview of the flavors that will become major themes of the meal.\n        \n\n         Coconut milk is the foundation of the remarkably aromatic curry of chicken livers and fresh pineapple called dup kai kaeng supalot, and of an amazing massaman curry with shredded potato and braised beef cheeks that break up the minute you dip a spoon into the bowl. In place of the gloppy peanut-butter sweetness found in many American massamans, Uncle Boons makes a drier sauce with the exotic muskiness of a walk through a spice shop, punctuated by the crisp pungency of green peppercorns.\n        \n\n         Over four meals, Uncle Boons appeared to be working its way toward consistent excellence. Still, there was one night when the green mango salad tilted too far into sourness, and another when damp, clumpy fried rice with crab suggested that the wok had been a few degrees shy of the smoking fury that leads to great fried rice.\n        \n\n         Spice levels could waver, too. But with only one or two exceptions, Uncle Boons came through with searing heat when it was called for, especially in that chicken salad or with a laab of minced lamb wok-fried to a deep mahogany and served warm; fresh mint and cilantro temper the spice but in no way tame it.\n        \n\n         Subtle flavors have a place in Thai cooking, too. There\u2019s a hint of a 1970s suburban party dip to the lon pu kem, which offers raw snap peas, radishes, crisp green mango and Thai eggplant to be dunked into a bowl of creamy, coconut-rich crab dip. And there is just enough fresh green chile in a thin nam prik sauce to bring out the sweetness in charcoal-grilled blowfish tails or baby octopus that would fit in your palm if you were silly enough to place them there and not between your teeth, where they belong.\n        \n\n         A coconut-milk-based curry yellow with fresh turmeric is one key to the greatness of Uncle Boons\u2019s khao soi. But really, everything in the bowl plays a part: the chicken leg stewed to irresistible tenderness, the pickled mustard greens, the big frizz of fried cilantro-flecked egg noodles on top and the same noodles boiled in the curry. I wouldn\u2019t scream if Ms. Redding and Mr. Danzer threw a few more dried chiles into the pot, but this is still the best khao soi I\u2019ve eaten in New York.\n        \n\n         Ms. Redding was born in northeastern Thailand, but before opening Uncle Boons she and Mr. Danzer roamed the country, and their cooking does, too. The couple may be in the market for a better electrician. But where it counts, in the kitchen, they have all the power any lover of Thai food could ask for.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 284, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/03/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-uncle-boons-in-nolita.html", "google_mag": 23.5}, {"review_text": "\n            Every so often, I\u2019ll wake up to an inbox full of friendly emails from people volunteering to help me do my job. The specific assistance they are offering is to meet me at some forthcoming restaurant, their stomachs empty and ready to contain at least half the menu. When I get three or four of these volunteers on the same morning, it invariably means that while I was sleeping other people were reading the\n            \n             advance press\n            \n            on an incipient opening that sounds both unusually enticing and intimidatingly expensive.\n           \n\n            The most recent rush of volunteers, it turned out, was inspired by the arrival in December of a Manhattan branch of the Beijing-based restaurant\n            \n             DaDong\n            \n            . While the Beijingese have excelled at the art of duck roasting for centuries, DaDong, I learned, is a relative newcomer, founded in the 1990s by the chef Dong Zhenxiang.\n           \n\n            At the restaurants \u2014 there are 10 in Beijing and six in other Chinese cities, not counting casual spinoffs \u2014 the birds revolve, a dozen at a time, inside a circular wood-fueled oven that Mr. Dong has patented. The result is what some people consider Beijing\u2019s best Peking duck. This is a magical combination of words. \u201cBeijing\u2019s best Peking duck\u201d suggests a mandatory eating experience in a way that, say, \u201cRussia\u2019s best Russian dressing\u201d does not.\n           \n\n            It took me and my first corps of volunteers some time to find one another because the restaurant\u2019s address, 3 Bryant Park, implied that the entrance would be somewhere around Bryant Park. DaDong is inside a stack of glass-and-steel blocks that has somehow been plunked down west of the park between 42nd and 41st Streets, beside a pocket plaza that was new to me, although the skateboarders seemed to know all about it.\n           \n\n            Inside the front door was a lobby where a host stood by herself behind a desk made out of a rock. I gave her the name and she gestured toward the elevators, sending me up to the dining room on the second floor. This space, designed by the hotel specialist\n            \n             George Wong\n            \n            , is the latest manifestation of modern China in Manhattan, a soothing study in straight lines and neutral tones with random outbreaks of contemporary Chinese art. A wraparound bar sits in the middle of the room under a hanging sculpture that looks like a flock of gold paper-towel tubes learning to fly.\n           \n\n            In this room, it is not exactly shocking to learn that the usual Peking duck garnishes may be supplemented with 10 grams of caviar for $42. In lieu of toast points, servers recommend a shard of skin. If you skip the fish eggs, they will tell you there are three ways to eat the duck: wrapped in one of the very thin and tender pancakes with scallions and a smear of sweet soy-black bean sauce (great stuff); poked into a round sesame puff with julienned cucumber and melon, raw garlic paste and the black bean sauce; and finally, dipped in a small pile of sugar, recommended for the skin alone.\n           \n\n            This kept everybody busy for some time. The bird was precisely carved, as if by a laser. None of us had seen crisper skin \u2014 you could bounce a quarter off it. The dip didn\u2019t improve it, but it is always nice to find a new use for sugar.\n           \n\n            The meat didn\u2019t make as firm an impression. It made very little impression at all, apart from my strong sense that there ought to have been more of it. Tasted on its own, it reminded me a bit of the lean, whitish, noncommittal supermarket pork chops I grew up on. Slowly, gradually, with great mental resistance but still inexorably, it dawned on me that I had paid $98 for a duck with almost no flavor.\n           \n\n            It was dry, too.\n           \n\n            New York City being a lush jungle of regulations, DaDong was forced to convert its wood-burning ovens to gas. Smoke might have added some flavor, but something seems to be lacking in the birds themselves, members of the Pekin breed raised on a farm in Indiana with special instructions to keep them lean, the way Mr. Dong prefers them.\n           \n\n            Unfortunately, DaDong\u2019s problems don\u2019t end with the duck. The menu in New York has been trimmed down considerably from the 280-page book presented to diners in Beijing, but it is still rife with dishes that are dead on arrival.\n           \n\n            Kung pao shrimp with beet coins and raw mushrooms tasted like ketchup. Sweet-and-sour pork ribs with preserved plums were as sweet as if they\u2019d been stewed in Dr Pepper, and a dusting of powdered sugar at the table didn\u2019t help.\n           \n\n            Little teepees of Ib\u00e9rico ham came wrapped around cold, dry wads of sticky rice. Champagne-glazed tomatoes were sweet enough to serve for dessert, and the \u201ccrispy mushroom salad\u201d they were stuffed with wasn\u2019t crisp and didn\u2019t particularly taste like mushrooms.\n           \n\n            Shiny and red as candied apples, the tomatoes were at least pretty to look at. Nearly everything I ate at DaDong was. The kitchen, led by Andy Xu, a veteran of\n            \n             Atlantic Grill\n            \n            and\n            \n             Blue Fin\n            \n            , certainly shows attention to the details of presentation. Occasionally, it sends out something that lives up to its appearance.\n           \n\n            A perfectly clear globe of ice, to be cracked with a spoon, kept soy-marinated ribbons of geoduck deliciously cold. Braised sea cucumber in a glossy soy-based sauce hit all the right sticky and soft marks.\n           \n\n            My favorite dish may be the seafood variation on the Sichuan classic Chongqing chicken called Hot and Spicy Lobster: a cut-up lobster stir-fried with nearly enough dried chiles to fill a pillowcase. A close second is the baby cabbage, sliced into threads and braised with chestnuts in saffron sauce.\n           \n\n            Whatever is causing the kitchen\u2019s reach-grasp ratio to break down doesn\u2019t seem to have affected the desserts. There is a fine plate of Beijing snacks, dense little half-sweet cakes made of lotus root, red beans, yellow split peas and so on. I enjoyed popping tiny seashells of white chocolate into my mouth to find out what each was filled with: Nutmeg? Tangerine? Wasabi? The simplest, though, the ice cream with an alluringly bitter edge of dried tangerine peel, was also the most rewarding.\n           \n\n            Servers sometimes seemed to be reading dish descriptions from a teleprompter, but they made up for that with a care and attentiveness that felt unforced. The sommeliers were particularly good at interpreting the wine list, which is well-rounded and can be quite reasonable. This list would get your attention almost anywhere, but in a Chinese restaurant in New York, it\u2019s a treasure.\n           \n\n            But even the most gently priced bottle can go only so far to smooth over the potholes on the menu, and the suspicion that the best Peking duck in Beijing has turned into something that would struggle to stand out in Parsippany.\n           \n\n\n             Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n            \n            ,\n            \n             Instagram\n            \n            ,\n            \n             Twitter\n            \n            and\n            \n             Pinterest\n            \n            .\n            \n             Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n            \n            .\n           \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 285, "rating": "Satisfactory", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/dining/dadong-review-midtown-chinese-peking-duck.html", "google_mag": 24.100000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n            JERSEY CITY \u2014 We were on our third pie of the night at\n            \n             Razza\n            \n            , across the street from City Hall here, when Ed Levine stopped chewing long enough to ask me a question:\n           \n\n            \u201cAre you going to say that the best pizza in New York is in New Jersey?\u201d\n           \n\n            Ed Levine knows what it means to make a strong claim for a pizzeria. The founder of the website\n            \n             Serious Eats\n            \n            and the author of the book \u201cPizza: A Slice of Heaven,\u201d he caused a stir in 2004 by writing in The New York Times that the pies at\n            \n             Pizzeria Bianco\n            \n            in Phoenix\n            \n             \u201cjust might be the best pizza in America.\u201d\n            \n            So when it started to dawn on me, about a year after my first dinner at Razza, that no pizzeria in the five boroughs gave me as much pleasure, I thought of Ed.\n           \n\n            New York pizzerias can be divided into those that apply the steady heat of gas (the most revered of these is\n            \n             Di Fara Pizza\n            \n            ) and those that subject their pies to the blistering, scorching fires of coal or wood. The high-heat group is further subdivided into the bakers, such as\n            \n             Co.\n            \n            and\n            \n             Totonno\u2019s\n            \n            , whose reputations rest on their dough, and the cooks. Among the cooks, there are those whose pizzaioli express themselves through combinations of toppings that have never before occurred to anybody (\n            \n             Roberta\u2019s\n            \n            ,\n            \n             Paulie Gee\u2019s\n            \n            ) or a less exhibitionistic, farm-to-table sensibility, of which the late\n            \n             Franny\u2019s\n            \n            was the paragon.\n           \n\n            Razza, which burns wood, is one of the few that excel at both dough and toppings. Even if Ed and I had learned, after our seven-minute PATH ride from the World Trade Center to Grove Street, that the kitchen had run out of cheese, tomatoes and the rest, I would have asked for a pizza dressed with nothing but olive oil. I\u2019m willing to bet it would be delicious that way, with the texture and flavor of naturally leavened bread right from the oven.\n           \n\n            I was glad it didn\u2019t come to that, though, because Razza dresses its pies with local ingredients so distinctive that every time I\u2019ve eaten there, I\u2019ve learned something about New Jersey farms.\n           \n\n            Our plan was to eat two pies and stop there. Green-edged coins of zucchini were scattered over the first, along with garlic cloves roasted to a translucent jelly, bright white ricotta and cracked pepper. In the center was a lemon wedge. There was ricotta on the other, too, and blots of house-made fig jam, and sheets of prosciutto-style Iowa ham, all covered by unwilted arugula.\n           \n\n            Like every pie I\u2019ve eaten at Razza, these two had been put together with exquisite sensitivity to the needs of the dough. The crust had no soggy or underbaked patches, and the bottom surface was crisp all the way from the puffy outer lip to the inner tip, which would jut straight out, or nearly straight, when I picked up a slice. When I tore open the outer rim, the crust crackled and the white interior steamed, soft, somewhat springy, with a slow-building, many-layered, lively flavor underlined by sea salt.\n           \n\n            I could have stopped there, my point made. But as Ed noticed belatedly, we\u2019d ordered two white pies, and he wanted to try one with tomatoes. His choice was the classic margherita. I was exceptionally curious, though, about a locavore variant called the Garden State margherita. Its sauce was made from New Jersey heirloom tomatoes and its mozzarella from the milk of Sussex County water buffaloes.\n           \n\n            While we were trying to decide, Dan Richer, the chef and owner, came to our table. Mr. Richer, who opened Razza five years ago, may or may not have recognized us, but in any case he had a solution. When he came back, he had placed one half of each margherita variant together to make a full circle. He hadn\u2019t invented this 50-50 format for us, he said; he\u2019d been experimenting with it for an idea he plans to spring on the public shortly: a pizza tasting menu.\n           \n\n            Razza\u2019s standard margherita, as I knew from previous exposure, is a model within the prescribed parameters of the form. I particularly admire the sauce, which is less acidic and bitter than many, and about as sweet as possible without tasting sugary.\n           \n\n            This, it turns out, was not a coincidence. Mr. Richer explained that each January, when he is fairly certain that the latest vintage of tomatoes has been canned, he and his staff conduct a double-blind tasting of eight or so brands from California, New Jersey and Italy. Using a seven-point \u201ctomato evaluation rubric,\u201d they assess each variety for color, viscosity, texture, skins and seeds (the fewer the better), \u201ctomato flavor,\u201d acidity and sweetness. The tomato with the highest score is usually the one he will buy, although he said that one year he blended three different brands, \u201ckind of like a Bordeaux wine.\u201d\n           \n\n            For the Garden State pizza, he runs ripe red local tomatoes through a food mill. I do not have a seven-point rubric to describe the flavor of the sauce, but I can say that it was bright and sweet enough to remind me that ripe Jersey tomatoes are still worth hunting down. The buffalo mozzarella, meanwhile, was more buttery and flavorful than any other American mozzarella I\u2019ve tried. It had a slight tartness and melted into soft, unrubbery, creamy-yellow circles.\n           \n\n            \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for that cheese for three years,\u201d Mr. Richer said, explaining that he had been tracking the water buffalo herd until it was big enough to ensure a steady mozzarella supply.\n           \n\n            It is not the first obscure homegrown ingredient he has snatched up and built a pizza around. For the past two years Mr. Richer has bought local hazelnuts, a crop that had stubbornly refused to grow in the state until the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station at Rutgers University developed\n            \n             blight-resistant trees\n            \n            . The nuts, fat and round, are barely chopped, and baked with ricotta, mozzarella and just enough honey to point up their natural sweetness. The pizza is called Project Hazelnut. I have never had anything like it.\n           \n\n            Farm-consciousness informs the whole menu. New Jersey greens and fruits go into the salads, which are fresh and vivid in ways not normally seen at the corner slice joint.\n           \n\n            New Jersey wheat berries and ambient New Jersey yeasts made up the first batch of the pizza dough starter, which has been burbling along for eight years now. New Jersey pork and Hudson Valley beef go into the tender meatballs, which are roasted in the wood oven until they carry a minor char. They are great meatballs, and suggest the kind of Italian restaurant Mr. Richer might have run had he not become transfixed by the intricacies of pizza.\n           \n\n            Pennsylvania cream and milk go into Razza\u2019s only dessert, a panna cotta that is more fluffy than firm and is served under a pool of dark salted caramel. Ed and I, having eaten a pizza and a half each, shared a single panna cotta. Then he asked me again: \u201cAre you going to say that the best pizza in New York is in New Jersey?\u201d\n           \n\n            I am, Ed. I am.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 286, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/dining/razza-pizza-review-jersey-city.html", "google_mag": 26.5}, {"review_text": "\n            Successful fast food restaurants have to be clean, efficient and consistent. As far as I can tell, though, it\u2019s never been necessary for the people who run them to care about food. How would you even tell? It would be like watching a porn film to assess the work of the dialect coach.\n           \n\n            Mark Ladner was the chef at\n            \n             Del Posto\n            \n            for a decade, steering it to\n            \n             a four-star review\n            \n            from The New York Times in 2010, and at\n            \n             Lupa\n            \n            for five years before that. Leaving all that behind, in October he opened\n            \n             Pasta Flyer\n            \n            , a restaurant in Greenwich Village where pasta in a compostable sugar-cane-fiber bowl costs between $7 and $8.75 and is cooked in less than a minute while you watch.\n           \n\n            If you tasted the fusilli with pesto, say, or the fettuccine Alfredo, and didn\u2019t know Mr. Ladner\u2019s history, you probably wouldn\u2019t guess that it had been made by one of the city\u2019s greatest pasta cooks. But you\u2019d be able to tell in a second that it was made by somebody who cared about food.\n           \n\n            The texture is the first thing most cheap pasta places screw up. Pasta Flyer doesn\u2019t screw it up. The noodles are firm and chewy, with a happy little bounce. Partly this is because they\u2019re not overcooked, but Mr. Ladner is also buying excellent dry pasta from Italy. It\u2019s similar to the imported stuff I like to buy when I cook at home, which costs almost as much by the pound as a bowl does at Pasta Flyer. The rigatoni is made with whole grain and the penne is gluten free; they\u2019re both as supple and smooth as the three shapes made from semolina.\n           \n\n            The sauces \u2014 which can be matched with any pasta \u2014 are pesto, beef rag\u00f9, Alfredo and marinara, with or without meatballs. You might see that and say, \u201cAh, classics.\u201d Or you might say, \u201csounds kind of basic?\u201d, with a rising inflection signifying that \u201cbasic\u201d is not a compliment. Your response will mirror your attitude toward Pasta Flyer as a whole.\n           \n\n            I\u2019m in the classic group. The basil pesto looks a little too glossy, more pur\u00e9e than paste, but it has the advantage of insinuating itself all over the pasta (fusilli is the default shape) and it still tastes like aged cheese and toasted pine nuts. The marinara is lively on its own and an agreeable partner for the meatballs, which are of the fine-ground, spicy, sausagelike school.\n           \n\n            The rag\u00f9 is lovely, if a little pale and lean. The Alfredo sauce, sweetly dripping from the fettuccine like rain from a leaf, hit me like a prescription opiate that had been specifically engineered for my opiate receptors. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019d had fettuccine Alfredo.\n           \n\n            Those who expect ingenuity from Mr. Ladner should be happy with the garlic dots. Everybody should be happy with the garlic dots, little fried puffs of choux pastry brushed with garlic butter. Like the browned slices of lasagna that you can eat with your fingers, they\u2019re street-fair food from a more advanced civilization. A few small vegetable sides, like a sweet-and-sour fried cauliflower with golden raisins, can be had, along with crisp little chopped salads. That\u2019s about it. Dessert, in the form of tiramis\u00f9 cannoli, will shuffle onstage later this week.\n           \n\n            Once your pasta is sauced and you\u2019ve helped yourself to a fork, a napkin and a tray, you settle the tab \u2014 paying is the slowest part of the whole procedure \u2014 and look for a table. These were plentiful on my three visits, particularly at night. I learned to avoid the seats directly under the satellite dish that hangs from the ceiling and echoes conversations held under it, disconcertingly. It\u2019s an artifact of Mr. Ladner\u2019s fixation on flying saucers, also seen in the door-handle design and in the doctoring of a blown-up photograph of the Roman Forum that covers one wall.\n           \n\n            In other words, Pasta Flyer is not where you take somebody you need to impress. For some reason, this is how our culture defines success for chefs: by how well their food performs the task of being impressive to a date, an employer or a fan of restaurant dining.\n           \n\n            Mr. Ladner, though, is using his skill, knowledge and connections not to make special-occasion fireworks but to make ordinary food that many people can afford. Pasta Flyer isn\u2019t spectacular, but it\u2019s still a major achievement. I\u2019ve eaten a lot of supposedly cheap pasta, and it\u2019s never as good as what Mr. Ladner is serving.\n           \n\n            There\u2019s precedent for devoting specialized attention to the problems of everyday living among architects and industrial designers, who may toggle between showpiece commissions and small, affordable houses. Lately the idea has begun to occur to chefs, including\n            \n             Daniel Patterson and Roy Choi\n            \n            in California, and Mr. Ladner\u2019s old pastry chef,\n            \n             Brooks Headley\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            Do enough people in Greenwich Village want $8 rigatoni to make Pasta Flyer a success? In a way, the location would work better if it didn\u2019t have to bear the weight of being the only one in town. As a solitary prototype, the restaurant has an odd, expectant air, as if it\u2019s ready for a crowd that hasn\u2019t shown up.\n           \n\n\n\n            Nick Anderer and Danny Meyer have been pursuing similar goals in the pizza universe.\n            \n             Martina\n            \n            , which opened in the East Village in the fall, is the less expensive younger sibling to\n            \n             Marta\n            \n            , their Roman pizzeria in NoMad. The prices run from $7.50 to $11.50 for a pizza that will serve one not-too-hungry person. Martina is supposed to be fast, too, although that hasn\u2019t always been my experience. One night my pizza arrived 19 minutes after I\u2019d ordered it \u2014 hardly a land-speed record.\n           \n\n            You do save some time ordering and paying at Martina\u2019s counter, but speed isn\u2019t the real selling point. Martina\u2019s charm is that it is a neighborhood place where nothing is a big deal, but where attention has been paid to all the little deals.\n           \n\n            If the idea of fagioli al fiasco with pizza appeals to you, the ones at Martina are excellent, as are the arancini, cylindrical fritters of creamy rice cooked with tomatoes. The wine list is a thumbnail version of Marta\u2019s, but the few wines are good ones; as at Marta, you\u2019re encouraged to drink sparkling wine in full or half bottles, kept here in an open refrigerator case facing the dining room.\n           \n\n            The pizza is in the style of Roman neighborhood joints. The crusts are flat, extremely thin, pale and crisp, but not crunchy. They\u2019re softer than the ones at Marta, which snap like crackers. The crust is merely a vehicle; what interest these pies hold is entirely in their toppings. Covered with mushrooms, say, or pork sausage with broccoli rabe, or grated cheese and shaved brussels sprouts, they can be very good. But the simple margherita is a bore.\n           \n\n            For dessert, there\u2019s vanilla soft-serve, either over espresso or under simple toppings like olive oil, sea salt, candied hazelnuts or chocolate sauce. Simple as it is, it helps make Martina into a restaurant instead of a pit stop. (Mr. Ladner might take notes here.)\n           \n\n            Neither Martina nor Pasta Flyer is trying to be a thrill ride. But finding a quick, cheap meal that betrays signs of actual care can be a thrill of its own.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 287, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/dining/pasta-flyer-martina-review.html", "google_mag": 32.400001525878906}, {"review_text": "\n\n             Cervo\u2019s\n            \n            , a two-month-old restaurant on the east end of Canal Street, is divided in two. In front is a long bar where bartenders stir sherry with lemon-lime soda and three cooks make all the food. In the rear is a squarish dining room that can fit about 16 people if they all hold their breath.\n           \n\n            The tight quarters back there, the low ceiling broken by a skylight, and the glossy wood paneling made me feel as if I were eating in the dining cabin of a large but not excessively luxurious sailboat. And the man at the table next to mine couldn\u2019t seem to find his sea legs.\n           \n\n            \u201cI don\u2019t recognize anything on this wine list,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is exciting, in a way, but ...\u201d\n           \n\n            Gamely, the sommelier asked what he usually liked to drink. \u201cUnoaked chardonnay and California-style sauvignon blanc,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you don\u2019t have any of those.\u201d\n           \n\n            He was right. Drinking at Cervo\u2019s means leaving familiar landmarks behind. Most of the wines are from Portugal and the rest from Spain, with very few well-known names between them. After a few false starts, the sommelier steered him to a vinho verde from a winery called\n            \n             Aphros\n            \n            . I\u2019d drunk it very happily on another night. It was more lush and ripe than the thin, fizzy vinho verdes that I cut my teeth on as a youngster, and had enough citrus to come in for a soft landing in Mr. Sauvignon Blanc\u2019s comfort zone. He took a sip, and looked as if he\u2019d decided to wait and see what happened.\n           \n\n            Without calling itself a wine bar, Cervo\u2019s does a good impersonation of one, pouring about 12 unfortified wines by the glass along with another dozen or so sherries, Madeiras and ports.\n           \n\n            On my previous visits I\u2019d ranged all over the list. I\u2019d enjoyed a sparkling wine bottled, with spirited acidity, by\n            \n             Sid\u00f3nio de Sousa\n            \n            in the Bairrada region of Portugal, by the Atlantic Ocean; a quietly flowery vermouth from the Basque Country, poured from a tap;\n            \n             Los Bermejos\n            \n            \u2019s illuminatingly bright dry malvasia, grown in the volcanic soil of Lanzarote, one of the Canary Islands; a glass of red from\n            \n             4 Monos\n            \n            , made in the mountains west of Madrid and so approachably low in tannin that Cervo\u2019s serves it chilled, like a Beaujolais.\n           \n\n            According to the owners, Nialls Fallon and Nick Perkins, the menu is inspired by Portugal and Spain, like the wine list. For years, they say, they talked about opening \u201ca Portuguese version\u201d of Swan Oyster Depot, the San Francisco institution. (They have another place in Brooklyn called\n            \n             Hart\u2019s\n            \n            , taken from Mr. Perkins\u2019s middle name. Hart is also an antique word for deer, which is what cervo means in Portuguese.)\n           \n\n            The menu reads like a wine bar\u2019s, too. Portions are generally small and the plates are unstudied, starting with some basics like fleshy green olives in olive oil and paprika, or pan con tomate with ripe tomatoes and shavings of bottarga.\n           \n\n            But while the wine list sails off into uncharted territory, the menu sticks closer to home. Few of the dishes would be familiar in Lisbon, but several would be right at home in\n            \n             Estela\n            \n            or\n            \n             Wildair\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            The main ideas that Mr. Perkins and Aaron Crowder, who share the chef duties, seem to have drawn from the cuisine of Portugal is that people there eat a lot of seafood and tend to keep things simple. This isn\u2019t a bad place to start, though.\n           \n\n            Their next move is a smart one, too. Mr. Perkins and Mr. Crowder cooked in many of\n            \n             Andrew Tarlow\u2019s restaurants\n            \n            , smallish Brooklyn places with locavore inclinations. At Cervo\u2019s, they work with very fresh seafood caught off the Northeastern coast, supplemented by a few things from farther away. It doesn\u2019t take much to make these ingredients stand out.\n           \n\n            The selection of oysters is not overwhelming, but each time I\u2019ve turned up there were new ones to swallow, Truro Pearls and Wellfleets from Cape Cod in August and, in September, Pink Moons and Savage Blondes from Prince Edward Island.\n           \n\n            From the raw bar also come things like whole white prawns marinated in white wine and garlic, or radishes shaved over anchodinas, the meaty and salty Spanish sardine fillets that are preserved like anchovies.\n           \n\n            The kitchen has a way of applying just enough chile heat to register: The pink flesh of yellowfin tuna was just starting to go opaque from lemon juice stirred with fermented Serrano chiles, while pickled banana peppers accentuated the sweetness of marinated and browned scallops, and stopped there.\n           \n\n            Cockles or small clams steamed open in vinho verde with garlic seem always to be on the menu, and they make a very delicious next step after cold seafood. There is often a strangely likable beef tartare with littlenecks and so much of the clams\u2019 steaming juices that it almost comes across as some kind of mutant chowder. Fish \u2014 porgy or Boston mackerel recently \u2014 goes right on the plancha in one piece.\n           \n\n            Chicken skewers with sweet onions and yogurt may sound, in the context of this menu, like a sop to the seafood-averse. It is, in fact, a standout. The chicken is marinated and griddled with ground fennel seed, coriander and other spices, a bit like the great Andalusian snack pintxos moru\u00f1os. The skewers are carried out on a plate with all their juices pooling around a spoonful of yogurt and petals of onions brought to the crunchy-tender threshold on the plancha.\n           \n\n            Dessert is an opportunity to look again at the Madeiras or one of the inexpensive ports, all from a young, boutique operation called\n            \n             Morgadio da Cal\u00e7ada\n            \n            . On some nights, there is a thick, yolk-rich custard infused with anise hyssop. Other times, I\u2019ve eaten soft, sweet vanilla pudding decorated with peaches and tiny yellow husk tomatoes. I can\u2019t decide which I like more.\n           \n\n            It would be easy to let my enthusiasm about Cervo\u2019s get the better of me, the way some people have gotten carried away over Hart\u2019s. The charm of both restaurants is that they come on easy, then deliver more than some places that are much more full of themselves.\n           \n\n            Overstating that charm wouldn\u2019t do Cervo\u2019s any favors. The lamb burger can be juicy one night and dry on another. (Either way, adding white anchovies for $3 more improves it, one of the few restaurant-burger upgrades I\u2019d say that about.) Raw cabbage leaves dressed with yogurt and bottarga, meanwhile, might have come from a completely different restaurant. Cervo\u2019s hasn\u2019t put down deep enough roots into Iberian food yet for the kitchen to flirt with trendier styles.\n           \n\n            So I won\u2019t make extravagant promises. I think you should just go and see what happens.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 288, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/dining/cervos-review-restaurant.html", "google_mag": 26.600000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n            If you\u2019ve ever hired a contractor, someone probably told you that you can get work that\u2019s good, fast or cheap, but not all three. This may be an immutable law for kitchen cabinets, but it is not always true of Thai restaurants, as I learned at a new place in Brooklyn with the memorable name\n            \n             Ugly Baby\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            We were still asking ourselves whether we\u2019d ordered too much when the first plate landed: four little fried coconut cakes, called tue ka ko, with sweet black beans and taro sticks embedded in their tops under a handful of chopped peanuts. Imagine coming across a snack that combines the best qualities of the doughnut, the mini-muffin and\n            \n             Orwashers\u2019\n            \n            toasted-coconut macaroon, and finding it not at some hipster\u2019s stand at\n            \n             Smorgasburg\n            \n            but on a dim sum trolley, and you have a pretty good idea of Ugly Baby\u2019s tue ka ko.\n           \n\n            It was the perfect dessert for a meal we hadn\u2019t eaten yet, I decided, just as the next dish touched down. This was kang hoh, rice vermicelli tangled up with tender pork in a tamarind-soured dry curry from northern Thailand. The bits of fried pork skin on top, curled like Fritos, gave me something to munch on while I wondered how much of my tongue the curry would shut down.\n           \n\n            Not too much, it turned out; the steady drive of the heat just made me want more. But by the time that became clear, the table was full. It had taken about five minutes. Nothing cost more than $25. All of it was very good and a few things were so exceptional that they are now pinned to my map of great Thai dishes in the city, up on the mental wall with such standbys as the duck curry at\n            \n             Ayada\n            \n            and the papaya salad with crispy ground catfish at\n            \n             Sripraphai\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            Kang kua supparod is one of them. The menu terms it a mushroom pineapple curry, but you will get a sharper idea if you picture mushroom slices and squares of pressed tofu paddling around in a creamy yellow sauce of crushed pineapple and coconut milk. You can see the lime leaves that flavor it, but you only taste the lemongrass, galangal, chiles and other complications.\n           \n\n            Another is a kao tod nom klook, a warm rice salad with roots in Laos. The rice is cooked with a dry curry and a nontrivial quantity of chiles, then seared to imprint a chewy, golden crust on it. Stirred with short bits of long beans, cilantro, mint, peanuts and, crucially, some tangy pink crumbles of fermented pork sausage, it performs best when wrapped in lettuce with a basil leaf, a dried chile and anything else you happen to discover on the plate.\n           \n\n            Ugly Baby is in Carroll Gardens, across Smith Street from the hole in the earth where the F and G tracks begin to climb toward their high-rise crawl over the Gowanus Canal. Open since August, the restaurant traces its lineage back to two restaurants that had brief lives not far away in Red Hook. One, Chiang Mai, a pop-up inside another establishment, was supposed to be temporary. The other, Kao Soy, wasn\u2019t, but the two owners found that their partnership was not built for the long haul.\n           \n\n            What the three restaurants share is Sirichai Sreparplarn. He shared chef duties at the first two and takes the wheel himself at Ugly Baby, which is named after the Thai superstition that evil spirits won\u2019t bother harming unattractive infants. The walls are painted in a James Rosenquist palette with quick, energetic brush strokes. The cooks and servers wear cartoon colored T-shirts, sneakers and aprons, except for the younger cook whose apron is printed with a monochromatic photograph of hand-lettered cassettes. There\u2019s buzzy guitar pop playing at volumes that can make the restaurant sound like a bar, even though the refrigerator at the entrance to the open kitchen isn\u2019t stocked with wine and beer yet.\n           \n\n            When\n            \n             I reviewed Kao Soy in 2015\n            \n            , Mr. Sreparplarn told me that he and his co-chef were passionate about serving \u201cthe real food from the north.\u201d He has let himself have the run of the country at Ugly Baby, although he still gives the north its due.\n           \n\n            In his larb, made with duck in the style of the Isan city of Udon Thani, smashed dried chiles do not so much coat the meat as embed themselves in it. As you chew, you summon up new waves of heat that the fresh leaves of Vietnamese coriander and bites of raw cabbage and cucumbers can do only so much to mitigate.\n           \n\n            Its only rival for sheer atomic power comes from southern Thailand. Kua kling is a beef curry that is stir-fried until it is completely dry and there is almost no hope of separating the meat from the chiles. Mr. Sreparplarn\u2019s version is cooked with needles of lime leaf and clusters of green peppercorns on their stalks. I tasted them right away, although it took five minutes before I was able to tell anybody about it.\n           \n\n            Southern Thai cooking isn\u2019t all scorched earth, though. Ugly Baby has a soothing fried sea bream rubbed with fresh turmeric and garlic, a favorite way to cook fish in that part of the country. Another calming seafood dish, this one from central Thailand, looks like a soup, but its tea-colored broth \u2014 soured with tamarind and brightened by sticks of ginger \u2014 is simply meant to flavor the fillets of red snapper in it, and keep them hot.\n           \n\n            Some of these dishes are rare in New York. You can\u2019t say that about the grilled chicken skewers marinated in coconut-peanut sauce, but Ugly Baby\u2019s might be the best available version of the dish, made with meaty thighs instead of stringy white meat.\n           \n\n            Like Mr. Sreparplarn\u2019s first two restaurants, Ugly Baby serves a rich kao soy, with beef in the coconut broth instead of chicken this time. I have to admit that I miss the crisp haystack of fried noodles and green papaya fritters that the first restaurant piled on top, and I wish Mr. Sreparplarn added in more pickled mustard greens and less chile oil (or served condiments on the side and let you decide how sour and spicy to make the soup, as Kao Soy did).\n           \n\n            The one dessert, when it is available, is rice pudding with durian. You may love this. Or, like me, you may try a spoonful to see if you still think durian tastes like boiled pearl onions. (Yes.) Or you may want to keep your distance. If you\u2019re in that group, and you haven\u2019t ordered the coconut mini-muffins, now\u2019s your chance.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 289, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/dining/ugly-baby-review-thai-brooklyn.html", "google_mag": 24.899999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n\n          ONE MAJOR THEME\n         \n         of modern restaurants is what we might call Asian stoner food. This is the cuisines of Japan, Korea and other places as seen through bloodshot eyes, the cravings of a hipster whose late-night munchies send him out in search of tacos stuffed with bulgogi, pigs\u2019 tails cooked in root beer and the like.\n        \n\n         Another competing theme is fat-on-fat cuisine. It challenges our notions of appropriate caloric intake, treats foie gras as a sacrament and has rarely seen an ingredient that couldn\u2019t be improved by cooking it with some part of the pig.\n        \n\n         If these styles were two friends of yours, you would think they were both narcissistic, a little dangerous and more fun to be around than almost anybody else you knew. And you would pray that they never, ever hooked up.\n        \n\n         But hook up they have, at a friendly and demented Greenwich Village tavern called Chez Sardine that\n         \n          Gabriel Stulman\n         \n         opened just after Thanksgiving. Mr. Stulman, an increasingly busy restaurateur, described Chez Sardine as \u201ca very inauthentic take on a Japanese izakaya.\u201d This is the kind of izakaya where a bite-size piece of hamachi sushi is crunchy with fried pork rinds, and where sashimi is slipped into a stack of flapjacks.\n        \n\n         For connoisseurs of Asian stoner cuisine, this will sound like high-grade chronic. But the chef, and one of Mr. Stulman\u2019s partners in Chez Sardine, is Mehdi Brunet-Benkritly, who spent four years at\n         \n          Au Pied de Cochon\n         \n         in Montreal, the Stanford of fat-on-fat cooking. So this is also the kind of izakaya where you can order a grilled cheese sandwich stuffed with foie gras, garnished with cucumbers pickled in rice-wine vinegar.\n        \n\n         The first face you see when you walk into Chez Sardine is\n         \n          Pat Morita\n         \n         \u2019s in a framed close-up from \u201cThe Karate Kid.\u201d Mr. Morita, who spent part of his childhood during World War II in an internment camp in Arizona, holds his chopsticks midair, midlesson, although the lesson here is a nuanced one about the strange things that happen when Japanese culture comes to America.\n        \n\n         Mr. Stulman, who also owns\n         \n          Fedora\n         \n         and\n         \n          Joseph Leonard\n         \n         , must have a kind of second sight for Greenwich Village real estate that lets him see future diners eating and drinking comfortably inside rooms not much bigger than a double bed. In this case, horizontal lines and walls of windows that meet by the corner of West Fourth and West 10th Streets give Chez Sardine an openness and energy out of proportion to its size. The only time the room feels small is when you are attempting to book one of the 28 seats, but even that is a fairly painless process thanks to a widget on Chez Sardine\u2019s Web site that lists open time slots rather than making you guess. (I hope the technology catches on.)\n        \n\n         Whether you sit at a table by those windows or at one of two short counters, the meal will probably start with sushi. Already it\u2019s a departure from Japan, where izakayas are more likely to serve sashimi, but that\u2019s just the beginning.\n        \n\n         Hamachi with chicharrones reads like a declaration of war, but no. The pork skins add crunch and a savoriness that deepens as you chew and that is kept in check by pickled ginger. And Arctic char, cured with sugar and lime zest and smoked, makes for sushi you could happily eat for breakfast.\n        \n\n         Mr. Brunet-Benkritly finds a cool contrast of textures by topping cubes of raw beef with spoonfuls of sea urchin, then surrounding the pair with a ring of nori that rustles between your teeth just before it softens. He also combines like with like, wrapping eel and braised pork belly in a hand roll and then piling on layers of richness with avocado and spicy mayonnaise. In dishes like this, it can seem as if Asian stoner food and fat-on-fat cuisine were always meant to be together.\n        \n\n         But doubts are never far off. If you prize the cold-water fattiness of mackerel, you\u2019ll wish it hadn\u2019t been squelched by crushed potato chips, fried leek threads and cold, underseasoned rice. And oyster fans will wish that the apple mousse mounded on top of sparkling raw Wellfleets was a little more tart and a lot less sweet.\n        \n\n         As the cooked dishes start to arrive, the pattern continues: sometimes excess succeeds, and sometimes it is just too much. Breakfast pancakes with raw fish, salmon roe and lime yogurt are as fun as they sound, both silly and luxurious. But a similar dish of raw seafood with fried rice balls can\u2019t repeat the trick. Unlike the pancakes, the rice has little flavor of its own, and it needs some to cope with an unruly mess of spicy mayonnaise, tobiko, seared scallops, raw mackerel and avocado paste.\n        \n\n         Hot and exceptionally creamy cod fritters would make an ideal bar snack, while the fried chicken nuggets \u2014 with strands of pickled cabbage and a garlic aioli that comes across as creamy Italian salad dressing \u2014 are like something you would wolf down when all the bars are closed.\n        \n\n         At times, technique and seasonings conspire, as they do with chopstick-tender braised beef in a peppery Japanese brown curry. At other times, they seem at odds. Mr. Brunet-Benkritly gets unusually fine results out of pork belly, slowly roasting it until it is tender, meaty, fatty, chewy and crunchy all at once. But it\u2019s hard to appreciate that neat bit of work with sweet barbecue sauce, raw and pickled cabbage, mayonnaise, pickled shallot, sriracha, shoestring potatoes and spreadable egg yolk fighting it out on the plate.\n        \n\n         Along the way there are terrific satisfactions, like the roasted salmon head, marinated in miso and maple syrup, which you poke at and poke at with chopsticks until you\u2019re sure you\u2019ve separated the bones from every bit of salty pink flesh and sweet skin. And there are lovely little grace notes, like the brussels sprouts in brown butter with apple pur\u00e9e, good enough to make you wish Mr. Brunet-Benkritly would take an interest in vegetables more often.\n        \n\n         There are, in fact, very few ways to put together a balanced meal at Chez Sardine. This may be the common curse shared by fat-on-fat cuisine, Asian stoner food and small-plates dining: When diners expect to be wowed by every bite, why would chefs waste their time on dishes that are meant to be supporting players?\n        \n\n         But we need those things, too, if we are supposed to get out of bed tomorrow and do this all again. After a certain point, even stoners and foie gras eaters crave a little restraint.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 290, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-chez-sardine-in-the-west-village.html", "google_mag": 21.600000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n            Usually, I can take or leave the slice of tomato that comes with almost every burger in America. The tomato at John Fraser\u2019s latest restaurant,\n            \n             the Loyal\n            \n            , is the first one I\u2019ve ever met that helps the burger so much that it becomes the whole point.\n           \n\n            Mr. Fraser calls it a \u201c22-step tomato.\u201d And thereby hangs a tale, no doubt, but in the interest of time let\u2019s skip to the finished product: a peeled plum tomato collapsed down to a red cushion that more or less covers the patty. It\u2019s juicy but not gushy, tart and sweet and complex, so it does some of the work normally done by ketchup, but it\u2019s more dynamic and delicious.\n           \n\n            You could eat it on its own, but it completes the somewhat austere flavor of the beef from a Piedmontese cattle breed. Even under a melted sheet of Comt\u00e9, the patty is not as woozily rich as many contemporary chef-burgers. In all, it\u2019s an ingenious notion from a chef who is on his fourth current restaurant and seems to be in no imminent danger of running out of ideas.\n           \n\n            The Loyal switched on the lights over its red awning on Bleecker Street in September. Unlike the last two places Mr. Fraser opened, which have themes \u2014\n            \n             Nix\n            \n            is vegetarian and\n            \n             Narcissa\n            \n            \u2019s menu revolves around the rotisserie \u2014 the Loyal is a free-for-all. It has one of those overpopulated menus that borrows from brasseries, trattorias and mainstream American taverns. Cold seafood and snack sections run in a skinny column on the left side, across from a long scroll of appetizers, pastas and main courses. All this may cause eye fatigue long before you get to the crawl of side dishes at the bottom of the page.\n           \n\n            The something-for-everybody menu works, in the sense that by around 6:30 p.m. it starts to appear as if everybody has decided to eat there at once: bachelorette-party celebrators in plastic tiaras; people who look like artists and people who look like art collectors; older couples gaping in amusement at younger couples who have no idea they\u2019re being gaped at.\n           \n\n            \u201cWhat brings all these people here?\u201d somebody at my table asked a server.\n           \n\n            She thought about it and shrugged. \u201cMichelin-star chef?\u201d\n           \n\n            One of Mr. Fraser\u2019s two stars went to Nix and the other to\n            \n             Dovetail\n            \n            , his first restaurant as chef and owner, and his most formal. The Loyal is slightly formal itself. Wine bottles rest on polished steel coasters, and servers sweep crumbs from the white tablecloths after every course. Home Studios designed the dining room after the style of a 1950s nightclub, with leather booths and banquettes and one round table up front half-secluded in a cove of mirrors and marble that looks as if it is reserved for Walter Winchell.\n           \n\n            The formality is a peculiarly high-decibel variety. Enhanced by clever but not overly wonky cocktails, people strain to talk over music that is never soft, even early at night before the room fills up. At times I wanted to stuff my ears with the Parker House rolls, and at other times, like when Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock rolled into \u201cIt Takes Two,\u201d I almost thought the noise was necessary for the interior to make sense.\n           \n\n            Starting with chilled seafood fits the retro mood of the Loyal. It\u2019s always smart to scoop up bay scallops when they are in their short season, especially as they are done at the Loyal, lounging in their shells in a pool of blood orange-ginger juice that you could drink by the glassful. When scallop season ends, the lobster tail dressed in smoked tomato sauce would make a fine consolation prize, as would the sweet, unrubbery shrimp in a cocktail sauce that leans heavily on Old Bay.\n           \n\n            The snacks are all over the map. Some borrow from Japan, like the soft-cooked eggs in the style of a ramen shop with red lids of jellied chile oil or the beech mushrooms, fried tempura style, wonderful even if their horseradish-cream sauce wasn\u2019t quite an ideal match. Others come from nearer to home.\n           \n\n            Molding a p\u00e2t\u00e9 of chicken liver so it looks like a stick of butter, then serving it on a glass butter dish, is undeniably a bid for Instagram stardom, but the port wine syrup that surrounded it was so bright and fruity that I couldn\u2019t be grumpy about it.\n           \n\n            Mr. Fraser is very skilled at getting vegetables to do things they\u2019re not normally inclined to do. Steamed avocado with quinoa sounds like a dish you\u2019d feed your enemies, but while it was on the menu I loved the way it almost melted into its spicy green chermoula sauce. Chayote, rarely an extrovert, got the extra spark it needed from an orange scribble of paprika-piquillo sauce.\n           \n\n            As partner for a bowl of polenta with truffles, broccoli pesto was unexpectedly sensible. A less eccentric idea, capellini with artichokes, still pulled off some surprises because Mr. Fraser got such bright and lively flavor out of the artichokes.\n           \n\n            With the main courses, the meal tends to settle down into a routine of standard meats and fish, enlivened by the occasional firecracker side dish. Lamb chops traveled with a terrific rice pilaf, pink with harissa. The burger took not just the 22-step tomato but also a little saucer of potato \u201ctots,\u201d large dice fried in duck fat. The starch for the hanger steak was potato pur\u00e9e with lobster gravy, which may not be the highest use of lobster but is almost certainly the highest use of gravy.\n           \n\n            Knowing that early in his career Mr. Fraser worked in an ice-cream parlor makes the heavy presence of sundaes on the dessert menu seem less pandering than it would in another restaurant. Or so I thought until our server told us, in breathy tones, about the \u201csundae set and candy shop,\u201d a pile of Neapolitan ice cream that comes with Pixy Stix, Chupa Chups, Gummi Bears, gold coins, M&Ms, chocolate pebbles and other sugar bombs.\n           \n\n            It would be a big hit with children, preferably somebody else\u2019s. My ageless companions enjoyed the Sonoma Harvest sundae instead, with br\u00fbl\u00e9ed figs and bits of honeycomb around yogurt and Concord grape sorbets. There\u2019s a very clever baked alaska, too; the toasted meringue is filled with graham-cracker ice cream sitting on a base of chocolate cake, so it tastes like s\u2019mores.\n           \n\n            The California-based artist Lukas Geronimas has been gradually filling the dining room walls with small, enigmatic paintings over the past few months. The ones toward the front could be illustrations from a book for children about friendly relations among humans, vegetables and farm animals. Toward the restrooms, the relations seem more than friendly. They\u2019d probably be a hit with somebody else\u2019s children, too.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 291, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/26/dining/the-loyal-review-nyc.html", "google_mag": 25.299999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n         And the award for the most improved restaurant of the year so far goes to ...\n        \n\n         Montmartre. Gabriel Stulman, owner; Tien Ho, chef.\n        \n\n         Prizes seemed unlikely after I ate there in April, when the restaurant was six weeks old. Wonderfully tender veal blanquette went to waste in a sauce that looked and tasted like salted milk. Thick breading on a skate wing vacuumed up any flavor that the fish, already underseasoned, might have offered. A mystifying upside-down tart inverted a slightly sweet pastry shell over a raw kale salad whose anchovy dressing made no impact to speak of.\n        \n\n         The outlook was not completely bleak. I liked the small wild snails around a pink raft of garlic sausage, and there was a fine brandade spiced with chile paste. The general trend, though, looked bad for\n         \n          Mr. Ho\u2019s desire to interpret\n         \n         \u201csuper old-school\u201d French cuisine in Chelsea.\n        \n\n         That week, Mr. Stulman\n         \n          sent word to restaurant blogs\n         \n         that the spirit of the menu was about to change \u201cto better showcase the diversity of ingredients and flavors that Tien is known for.\u201d\n        \n\n         Mr. Ho made his name as the chef in the crazy early days of bo ssam delirium at Momofuku Ssam Bar, and then, to more restrained applause, at M\u00e1 P\u00eache. The second restaurant was itself meant to be a French-Vietnamese mash-up, which is what he now had in mind for Montmartre. Considering that his Asian roots were showing right from the start, though, and that snails with sausage had been on the opening menu at M\u00e1 P\u00eache, the shift in emphasis sounded fairly incremental.\n        \n\n         But the effect was transformative, as if National Grid had finally turned on the gas. When I returned to Montmartre in May, Mr. Ho was tilting an impressive French boudin toward China by blending it with five-spice powder and surrounding it with a black vinegar reduction and a spicy-tingly oil of dried chiles and Sichuan peppercorns. Boudin\u2019s livery richness can start to taste flat over the long haul, but the Asian trick of playing blood against fire made each new bite as powerful as the first.\n        \n\n         As a sauce for grilled branzino fillets whose skin had been firmly seared, Mr. Ho had in mind some pickled lemons and a thick, dark vinaigrette of pine nuts and black garlic that was like pesto\u2019s moody and more daring sister.\n        \n\n         Where the menu once had a boxed list of daily specials, or plats du jour, it now highlighted elaborate platters for two, like a whole duck. Long slices of breast had an edge of golden skin sweetened with kumquat glaze, while the legs had been braised with vadouvan, the subtle and focused curry powder. The idea was to fold the meat and some cabbage braised with duck fat and smoked duck confit inside one of the buckwheat-scallion crepes, moo-shu style, but the crepes fell apart. At $78, the dish should have been flawless; eaten with a fork and a dash of regret, \u00a0it was still extraordinarily good.\n        \n\n         The cleverest and most dramatic Eurasian marriage is the pot au pho, a far less expensive plate for two, at $44. Mr. Ho takes the rich brown beef bouillon; the tender potatoes, carrots and leeks; and the mighty braised and grilled short rib on the bone from France. From Vietnam come the star anise and sprigs of Thai basil and cilantro that season the broth, the thin slices of raw sirloin that slowly cook in it, and the sriracha-enhanced hoisin sauce that you stir into it.\n        \n\n         For a moment, Montmartre\u2019s rekindled fire seemed to help one recipe that hadn\u2019t changed, a rice pudding with jackfruit and bananas. On the first encounter it was bland and not very creamy, with hard grains of underdone rice. Another time, those flaws had vanished; on a third try, it was the rice that vanished, leaving something like whipped cream with fruit. Another dessert, a mille-feuille with milk-chocolate mousse between planks of puff pastry, has been a pleasure from the start.\n        \n\n         Once in a while, Montmartre still gets a case of the blahs. The dressing on a wax bean salad, allegedly a tahini-soy vinaigrette, made no impression, and curls of raw hamachi with diced apples didn\u2019t rise above routine.\n        \n\n         The plating can be slightly untidy and the flavors a bit reticent even now. But Montmartre\u2019s French fusion has more conviction than the straight-up French food of many other New York chefs. Mr. Stulman is the downtown restaurant scene\u2019s leading miniaturist, able to get full-scale scenes into cramped rooms. His last place was called\n         \n          Chez Sardine\n         \n         , but Montmartre is the one where you sometimes feel like a canned fish. Seats in the two dining rooms (a tiny one downstairs, a slightly less tiny one upstairs) are so close together that you can find yourself playing Twister with servers who are simply trying to clear your plate.\n        \n\n         Montmartre\u2019s wine list, divided between France and the United States, encourages a more restrained drinking style, in part because your dollar won\u2019t go as far here as it will elsewhere. As in his other places, Mr. Stulman has very high wine markups, about three times retail. Wines by the glass hover around $10, which sounds reasonable until you are poured four ounces of Bourgueil in a tumbler the size of a juice glass. It looks, and is, ungenerous.\n        \n\n         But I\u2019ve certainly paid more than $13 for cocktails that are not nearly as tightly assembled as Montmartre\u2019s, devised by Mr. Stulman\u2019s director of bar operations, Brian Bartels. There\u2019s also an elegantly disassembled Campari and soda on a silver tray, inspired by the Caf\u00e9 de Flore in Paris: hefty ice cubes, a bottle of Perrier and a highball glass of the cherry-red aperitif spritzed with grapefruit bitters, to mix as you like.\n        \n\n         As he has done before, Mr. Stulman reserves a large number of tables for walk-ins. Prime-time reservations are snatched up quickly, but it is, in fact, possible to drop by and be seated right away.\n        \n\n         And once again, he has hung the walls with photographs. Some, like the Vogue fashion shoots or a nattily dressed Joe Louis walking arm in arm with his wife, have a cool elegance. Some are rowdy, like the men in a saloon celebrating the end of Prohibition by guzzling straight from a keg. Many were shot in Paris, and others in New York. The images don\u2019t seem to belong together, but they talk to one another intercontinentally. This may have been the idea of Montmartre all along, but now the kitchen is in on the conversation, too.\n        \n", "google_score": 0.10000000149011612, "id": 292, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-montmartre-in-chelsea.html", "google_mag": 20.299999237060547}, {"review_text": "\n            Can anybody who has to think about the price of groceries still keep up with the sushi scene in New York? Just in the past year we\u2019ve gotten at least five omakase-only sanctuaries \u2014 Sushi Noz, Sushi Amane, Noda, Shoji at 69 Leonard Street and Ichimura at Uchu \u2014 where the price of a meal, before drinks and tax, is somewhere between $250 and $300. If you were already inclined to think that the Japanese seafood game, like so many other things in Manhattan, is rigged in favor of the robber barons, these restaurants won\u2019t change your mind.\n           \n\n            But the next time you despair of ever tasting another slice of yellowtail, I\u2019d suggest dropping into an izakaya called\n            \n             Wokuni\n            \n            for lunch or dinner. A short detour from Grand Central Terminal, it has been in business since October. So far it has not drawn much attention to itself.\n           \n\n            Given the mixed messages it sends out, this is understandable. It has soaring ceilings, a backlit bar with shelves so high the topmost bottles can be reached only by a gymnast, an undulating wall of overlapping tiles that suggests Frank Gehry in his fish-scale period, and a constant dance beat in the background that won\u2019t stop no matter how hard you cry. In other words, it looks like the Asian fusion restaurant in the lobby of a W hotel built around 1999.\n           \n\n            The menu sings another tune, though. It is full of\n            \n             traditional izakaya dishes\n            \n            like tofu agedashi and chicken karaage, rounded out by sashimi and grilled skewers. There is one twist, though: Wokuni is much, much more interested in seafood than the average izakaya.\n           \n\n            As a rule, the fish at Wokuni is exceptionally good and almost bizarrely fresh, shipped daily from the\n            \n             Tsukiji fish market\n            \n            in Tokyo or from a fish farm in Nagasaki owned by the restaurant\u2019s parent company,\n            \n             Tokyo Ichiban Foods\n            \n            . (Its admirable motto: \u201cWe are changing the dietary culture in Japan with persistence.\u201d) Raw or cooked, the seafood at Wokuni sets it apart from other izakayas in New York, best seen as embassies of Japanese drinking culture in which the food plays the role of the ambassador\u2019s chauffeur.\n           \n\n            Sushi is rare at standard izakayas, but it is made and sold at Wokuni, at very moderate prices. While many omakase chefs age their fish to make it supple and relaxed, the sushi at Wokuni is almost insolently fresh. And if you merely get a few $5 pieces of king yellowtail sushi, or $6 pieces of sea bream sushi, and maybe a slice or two of golden-eye snapper sushi at $9 each, you won\u2019t regret it. The fish will be shiny. It will probably be chewy. The pinks and reds and ivories and whites in its flesh will be as distinct as if they\u2019d been painted on with a nail-polish brush.\n           \n\n            But sushi is not the highest use of Wokuni\u2019s seafood. What the place lacks are the seasonal fish that can make a sushi excursion really memorable: gizzard shad, striped jack, firefly squid. When it comes to sashimi, though, this is not much of a liability, and the firmness of Wokuni\u2019s fish becomes a point in its favor.\n           \n\n            Before ordering sashimi \u2014 or, in fact, anything else \u2014 check the daily specials posted by the chef, Kuniaki Yoshizawa. They will almost always include several cuts of bluefin from farm-raised fish. If you come very early for lunch and manage to get the Wokuni don, a special that centers on a sashimi rice bowl and shrimp tempura, it will strike you as an incredible bargain at $24. The kitchen makes only five Wokuni-dons a day, though, so chances are you will have to content yourself with the kaisen-don, and chances are that even though it doesn\u2019t include tempura, the $18 you pay will still seem like one of the best raw-fish deals in town.\n           \n\n            Things get even more intriguing when Wokuni\u2019s seafood comes into contact with heat. Again, the specials should be your starting point.\n           \n\n            There may well be a grilled yellowtail collar. If you are in the habit of ordering this at your favorite izakaya, it is a good bet that you will be surprised by how much cleaner and sweeter it tastes here.\n           \n\n            Bluefin collars and jaws are not served often enough for anybody to get into the habit of ordering them. The grilled collar at Wokuni one recent night was one of the greatest pieces of cooked fish I\u2019ve had in a long time, every bit of it worth chasing into the hollows of bone, skin and cartilage where it hid. It is not always available, but the grilled bluefin tail is, carved into a steak with the backbone sliced open so you can get at the teaspoonful of hot, clear jelly inside the spine.\n           \n\n            Mr. Yoshizawa has had the surprising idea of treating the angles and corners of the sea bream\u2019s body like chicken wings. Tucked into triangles, fried until crunchy and served with lemon, they are meant to be gnawned on between sips of sake. On the other hand, ei hire, a frequent special of cured, dried skate fin cut into squares, makes a chewy and likable sidekick to beer. Fish and chips, of course, will go with either \u2014 the fish species changes from night to night, but it tends to be extremely fresh, crunchy and light on batter.\n           \n\n            The chips, made from the Japanese mountain yam, were never crunchy and always needed more salt. Sometimes salt came with them, and sometimes it didn\u2019t. Those yam fries are an example of what happens once you venture away from seafood at Wokuni: The ingredients aren\u2019t doing the heavy lifting anymore, and everything tastes sort of, well, ordinary.\n           \n\n            Certain things are on the right side of ordinary, like the fried tofu in dashi; the warm rolled omelet, particularly when topped with grilled freshwater eel; and the tender, ghost-white baby sardines with grated daikon. Others are on the wrong side, like the grilled scallops in butter and the monkfish liver that strongly recalled canned cat food.\n           \n\n            If I worked in the neighborhood, I would eagerly return at least once a week, sticking as closely as possible to the fish specials. I doubt I\u2019d get bored, but I would keep my eye out for something that Wokuni could put on the menu, but so far hasn\u2019t. The parent company runs a farm that raises tiger blowfish, and about 50 restaurants in Japan that serve it. Tiger blowfish is supposed to be the most delicious kind of fugu. I think New York could make it feel appreciated on Lexington Avenue.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 293, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/dining/wokuni-sushi-japanese-restaurant.html", "google_mag": 22.0}, {"review_text": "\n            Riad Nasr and Lee Hanson named their new restaurant after a David Johansen song from 1978,\n            \n             \u201cFrenchette.\u201d\n            \n            The first line is, \u201cYou call that love in French, but it\u2019s just Frenchette,\u201d and later when he rhymes that with \u201cnaturalette\u201d and \u201cleatherette\u201d you know the suffix isn\u2019t diminutive, it\u2019s dismissive. The song is about what you do once you figure out that you\u2019re not going to get the real thing, and Mr. Johansen\u2019s answer is simple enough. \u201cLet\u2019s just dance,\u201d he sings. Never mind love.\n           \n\n\n             Frenchette\n            \n            , which opened in TriBeCa in April, isn\u2019t fake French, but it isn\u2019t the real thing, either. Since 1997, when\n            \n             Keith McNally\n            \n            hired them as the opening chefs at\n            \n             Balthazar\n            \n            , Mr. Nasr and Mr. Hanson have cooked side by side, building a kind of brasserie-steakhouse hybrid out of standards from both genres. Mr. McNally kept loading them up with new restaurants, giving them joint command of Pastis, Schiller\u2019s Liquor Bar and\n            \n             Minetta Tavern\n            \n            , none of which could really be called chef-driven.\n           \n\n            Frenchette, their own place and their first without Mr. McNally, takes some liberties with the formula, but not enough to get them recognized as visionaries on the level of\n            \n             Pierre Gagnaire\n            \n            . Frenchette says: Never mind art, let\u2019s just cook.\n           \n\n            The restaurant is divided into two chambers. In front and on display to the street is a lounge with Art Deco curves, where bartenders percussively clack shakers behind a long river of zinc. If you have a seat, this room is the height of metropolitan civility. If you are waiting for one, as many people are on any given night, it\u2019s purgatorial.\n           \n\n            The dining room is in back, behind a pair of arches and up a step so slight that its only conceivable purpose is to raise the insurance premiums; every time I approached it a worried server materialized to tell me to look out. The small tables are too small and the big ones, encircled by red-leather banquettes the size of living-room sofas, give you enough space to spread out a map while you eat. The room is grandly scaled and conspicuously underdesigned, a simplification of the brasserie archetype that doesn\u2019t try to reproduce every chipped tile and nicotine stain. It\u2019s a room for people who have outgrown illusions.\n           \n\n            That must describe half the people in New York, judging by the number of times I\u2019ve been asked how to get a reservation at Frenchette at an hour when an adult might reasonably be in the mood for dinner. Even well-placed magazine editors with highly resourceful assistants can end up eating at 6 or 10 p.m., as I did.\n           \n\n            In the brasserie mode, the menu rambles. It goes on too long; not everything on it is worth rambling about. But once you sort it out, it\u2019s full of dishes worth planning a night around.\n           \n\n            Some of them don\u2019t look wildly impressive unless you know how they\u2019re made. For each order of brouillade, a pan of eggs has to be stirred constantly over a small flame for a long time, until they look like grits. (There\u2019s a reason you don\u2019t see brouillade on many menus.) Dropped on top are a few excellent snails in parsley and garlic, a buttery garnish for very buttery scrambled eggs.\n           \n\n            Calf\u2019s liver was sweet and custardy, the goal in cooking it, and one that\u2019s not often reached. Sweetbreads with creamy white insides were fried to a pale, crinkled gold, then served with a brown, French, lovely and anachronistic sauce made from veal jus and crayfish. Lobster was roasted on a rotisserie, sending some of the shell\u2019s flavor into the meat, which was then given a very luxurious bath in curry butter.\n           \n\n            The entire roast chicken is juicy without tasting of brine, a rare thing these days. Hidden under the drumsticks and thighs are rafts of baguette that sat under the rotisserie, imbibing every drop that fell from the bird. Some diners might say bread wet with drippings is too homespun for a dish that costs $68. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.\n           \n\n            The menu is full of things that take years of practice to get right. Duck breast with a side of fries sounds ridiculously simple, but look at the crackle on that duck skin, and listen to that echoing crunch on the fries. If these chefs learned anything from Mr. McNally, it\u2019s that people will overlook many lapses if you feed them great French fries. At Frenchette, they overlook the peculiar steak knife brought out with the duck; its sharp side is straight and its dull side is curved, and everybody who picks one up makes a joke about slicing open a finger. That would be one way to turn tables faster, but I never saw any casualties.\n           \n\n            The kitchen is at its most sure-footed with big pieces of animals, whether they\u2019re classed as appetizers or main courses. (The guinea hen terrine appetizer is a chunky pink brick that could serve as dinner.) All those meats, combined with the chefs\u2019 fondness for fat-enhanced sauces that cling to your lips, give the menu a wintry feel, something that the recent proliferation of peas and artichokes on the plates here doesn\u2019t quite hide.\n           \n\n            So far, Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nasr have responded to the hot weather by changing ingredients but not the menu\u2019s spirit. Green celtuce stems can be a nice crisp side dish for summer, but Frenchette serves them in a steaming-hot gratin, slick with bone marrow; it\u2019s perfect for January. The blood sausage slab on top of a buckwheat galette that surfaced at the end of June was as seasonal as earmuffs.\n           \n\n            Reversing the natural order of the universe, the appetizers and the smaller \u201camuses\u201d often seem more tentative than the main courses.\n           \n\n            Blowfish tails brushed with mustard and spice-bearing bread crumbs are terrific when they\u2019re available, and the chefs should get some kind of award from the French government for serving iced oysters Burgundy-style, with peppery finger-length chipolata sausages. But gumball-size smoked eel beignets with a cr\u00e8me-fra\u00eeche ranch dressing called \u201cFranchette\u201d didn\u2019t taste much like eel; pig-foot croquettes were a washout; and a bowl of oily whole-wheat spaghetti with bottarga needed to be slapped with more lemon and salt.\n           \n\n            With desserts, Frenchette tries the blunt approach that works so well for its main courses, and comes up short. Not very short, but enough to make you wish more attention were being paid. The mille-feuille doesn\u2019t shatter on impact like the ones at\n            \n             Le Coq Rico\n            \n            or\n            \n             Benoit\n            \n            , and the pastry crust under the long band of cooked fruit in the apple tart needs to be crisper or more buttery.\n           \n\n            One of the more clever moves Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nasr made is hiring Jorge Riera to shepherd a list of natural, biodynamic and organic wines. Not every sommelier who has become infatuated with these labels knows where to find the good stuff, but he does. This means, though, that you will probably not end up drinking what you thought you wanted to drink. There are few safe harbors of familiarity; even if you just want sparkling water, you have a choice of Vichy Catalan or Mondariz.\n           \n\n            You\u2019d have to be delusional to wager money on the longevity of a restaurant in New York, but Frenchette is the closest thing to a safe bet that I\u2019ve seen in years. Mr. Nasr and Mr. Hanson seem to be in it for the long haul; if one of them hasn\u2019t held the other\u2019s head down in a pot of French onion soup by now, it\u2019s probably never going to happen. More than that, they know how to flatter New Yorkers with food that doesn\u2019t scream for attention but that smiles back when you notice it.\n           \n\n\n\n              Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 294, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/10/dining/frenchette-review-restaurant-tribeca.html", "google_mag": 29.600000381469727}, {"review_text": "\n            SEATTLE \u2014 As great restaurants will do,\n            \n             JuneBaby\n            \n            pulled me in from more than one direction. The first of course was the sheer pleasure of the cooking. (Without that, the others wouldn\u2019t matter.) The food is Southern, which I was primed to like before I walked through JuneBaby\u2019s Dutch doors in this city\u2019s Ravenna neighborhood. And whenever Edouardo Jordan\u2019s menu offered a dish I\u2019d expect to see at a Southern restaurant, he gave me something better than I\u2019d imagined.\n           \n\n            Fried catfish over grits can be better in theory than reality. At JuneBaby, the fish, from an Idaho farm, is firm, tight, fresh and free of bottom-feeder muddiness. The crust is semolina, which stays crisp and unsoggy. The grits are fluffy, yellow, full of corn flavor. Ringing the grits is an orange circle of shrimp bisque. Strictly speaking, shrimp bisque has no business on fish and grits, but if you see the bisque as a tamer, richer stand-in for hot sauce it makes a delicious kind of sense.\n           \n\n            This is the tactic \u2014 find superior ingredients and bring some fancy kitchen tricks to bear on them \u2014 favored by most of the South\u2019s prominent restaurants. If that were all Mr. Jordan had in mind, I would still think JuneBaby is a very good restaurant. But on the menu of this nearly year-old establishment are dishes that I wasn\u2019t expecting, that many of those other restaurants don\u2019t serve, that pulled me in deeper.\n           \n\n            Like any good Southern chef, Mr. Jordan loves his pork. But I paid closer attention when I noticed which parts of the pig he\u2019s cooking. He will boil ham hocks with collard greens until the leaves are soft and velvety and wonderfully smoky. He stews pigs\u2019 ears until they surrender their ornery stiffness, then slices and fries them into irresistible, crunchy sticks. He seasons okra and tomatoes with a North African spice mix and stews them with hog maw, otherwise known as the outer wall of the stomach.\n           \n\n            \u201cAlmost nobody likes it,\u201d\n            \n             Josh Ozersky wrote of hog maw\n            \n            in Esquire in 2014, a year before he died. \u201cIt\u2019s tough and tasteless, like the chitterlings to which it is attached.\u201d\n           \n\n            Mr. Jordan would disagree. By the way, he cooks chitterlings, too.\n           \n\n            These are the cuts that enslaved black people on plantations were allowed to keep when hogs were killed; after Emancipation, these were the cuts they might have had the money to afford and the skills to make into something memorable. Their healthy representation on the menu tells you that JuneBaby is not just a Southern restaurant but, specifically, a black Southern restaurant.\n           \n\n            Of course, much of the huge edifice of Southern food was built by black farmers and\n            \n             black cooks\n            \n            : as enslaved people in plantation kitchens and in their own families\u2019 cabins; later, as domestic servants, hotel chefs, railroad cooks, restaurateurs and entrepreneurs. Mr. Jordan is interested in all of it, but he particularly wants to introduce customers to the food of his family.\n           \n\n            He was raised in St. Petersburg, Fla., where the surrounding culture wasn\u2019t particularly Southern but his mother\u2019s table was. \u201cThe food she cooked was the only food she knew,\u201d Mr. Jordan said in a phone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s where I got my experience of fried fish, fried chicken, braised meats, offals, bread pudding.\u201d\n           \n\n            JuneBaby\u2019s oxtails are a tribute to one of her mainstays. Mr. Jordan deepens the flavor of the beef by roasting it before braising. He focuses the broth by clarifying it with egg whites, as he would have done in culinary school and in kitchens where he\u2019s worked, such as\n            \n             the French Laundry\n            \n            in California and\n            \n             Per Se\n            \n            and\n            \n             Lincoln Ristorante\n            \n            in New York. But he doesn\u2019t try to prettify what the menu calls Momma Jordan\u2019s Oxtails, serving them whole, with cubes of turnip and rutabaga, the hunks of beef barely hanging onto tailbones whose wide, white wings flare out like propeller blades.\n           \n\n            The chitterlings are essentially his paternal grandmother\u2019s recipe, stewed with onions, carrots and garlic. Instead of water, he might use some chicken stock, or the collagen-rich liquid thrown off by the pigs\u2019 ears. Rather than use a pot on the stove, he softens them in a pressure cooker. This both speeds the process by several hours and allows him to welcome the customers who line up each night waiting for the doors to open into a dining room that does not smell like intestines.\n           \n\n            As variety meats go, intestines are not at the top of my list. Out of strong curiosity, I\u2019ve eaten them packed into andouillettes in France, fried and kept under heat lamps in a gas station in Mississippi, and grilled over charcoal in the backyard of a Korean restaurant in Queens. I liked them best at JuneBaby.\n           \n\n            \u201cMy grandmother\u2019s chitterlings were a thing I loved, but never talked about,\u201d Mr. Jordan said, a thought that will sound familiar to immigrants and other people whose families\u2019 food veers from the mainstream American diet. \u201cYou tell your friends as a kid you eat chitterlings, they run away from you.\u201d\n           \n\n            Eventually he ran away from them, too, until he began to prepare a follow-up to his first restaurant as both chef and owner,\n            \n             Salare\n            \n            , down the street.\n            \n             The menu at Salare, he has said\n            \n            , expresses what he has learned in his career, centering on the Italian and French food he made in other people\u2019s restaurants. JuneBaby, though, \u201cspeaks on who I am as an individual soul and as an African-American male.\u201d And to do that he realized he would need to go back to \u201cthese ingredients that we don\u2019t want to talk about\u201d and start to show them off.\n           \n\n            Junebaby\u2019s chitterlings never come off the menu. They are not a huge revenue center for the restaurant but they may be, in a cultural sense, a loss leader.\n           \n\n            The dining room has a welcoming, domestic atmosphere; somehow it always feels as if a warm breeze were blowing through the screens, even in winter with the windows shut.\n           \n\n            For all the braised and simmered and stewed dishes, the kitchen glides easily into lighter territory. Vegetables keep their crunch. Bright green broccoli is tossed with grated Cheddar, almonds, apples and very delicate puffs of pork skin, all of them sharpened by preserved-lemon vinaigrette.\n           \n\n            The buttermilk biscuits and raised dinner rolls, known here as Antebellum Wheat Buns, are made with a light, practiced hand under the direction of Margaryta Karagodina, the pastry chef. Red-flint cornbread, baked in an iron skillet, gets its minerally sweetness from sorghum.\n           \n\n            Some of the desserts are slices of church-supper favorites, like a rich brick of bread pudding, interspersed with dark chocolate and soft apricots, sitting on cr\u00e8me anglaise. The Black Forest cake was the kind you rarely see anymore, three chocolate-cake layers frosted with cocoa-dusted whipped cream.\n           \n\n            Alongside one of these, it\u2019s a good idea to let Mr. Jordan take you all the way back to the beginning of his career and have a flip. This is frozen fruit juice \u2014 pineapple the night I had it \u2014 in a paper cup, a tribute to the homemade Popsicles Mr. Jordan used to whip up out of powdered drink mix and sell when he was a boy in St. Petersburg. If the word flip doesn\u2019t ring a bell, one of its other names might: huckabuck, hucklebuck, frozen cup, freeze cup, cool cup.\n           \n\n            If you\u2019re still in the dark, a definition can be found in\n            \n             the JuneBaby encyclopedia\n            \n            . This still-growing document, found on the restaurant\u2019s website, defines menu terms and concepts in Southern cuisine from Aunt Jemima to yams (\u201cMost common African staple that fed enslaved Africans on board ships.\u201d).\n           \n\n            The encyclopedia is another way JuneBaby drew me in. It nudged me to consider what I was eating. And it situated Mr. Jordan\u2019s family recipes in a centuries-long arc of American history. Many restaurants start with a chef\u2019s personal story. JuneBaby traces that story back to where it meets the country\u2019s.\n           \n\n\n             Follow NYT Food on Facebook\n            \n            ,\n            \n             Instagram\n            \n            ,\n            \n             Twitter\n            \n            and\n            \n             Pinterest\n            \n            .\n            \n             Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n            \n            .\n           \n", "google_score": 0.20000000298023224, "id": 295, "rating": "\u2605\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/dining/junebaby-review-seattle-black-southern-food.html", "google_mag": 32.79999923706055}, {"review_text": "\n            There isn\u2019t another bar in the city like\n            \n             the one that opened\n            \n            in February as part of the redesign of David Chang\u2019s Momofuku Ko. One thing that sets it apart is that it doesn\u2019t have a name. Credit-card receipts call it \u201cMomofuku Ko,\u201d even though it operates in its own little room with its own entrance. The door, a few steps past Ko\u2019s along the East Village alley known as Extra Place, is marked \u201cKo.\u201d The menus don\u2019t give a name at all.\n           \n\n            They don\u2019t look much like menus, either. They\u2019re notebooks in which the items available, presented in a short \u00e0 la carte list (in contrast to the hourslong tastings offered for $255 at Ko), are handwritten on a fresh page each day, by different employees using different pens. The date is at the top over a list of dishes that you will not find together anywhere else.\n           \n\n            Lately there has been a lucid, refreshing plate of raw sea scallops, sliced cold and mixed with fresh green shiso and folds of pineapple, red with ground chiles. Lightly cured fillets of sardine made a thrilling appearance last month in a brick-red oil flavored with paprika, cayenne, and other components of tandoori paste. Both were solidly in the tradition of Momofuku small plates that the world has known since Mr. Chang\u2019s\n            \n             Ssam Bar\n            \n            began remixing various Asian ideas after-hours.

You could tour the city\u2019s proudest French restaurants without coming across a more skillfully done puff pastry crust, notched like a pinwheel and baked to a deep mahogany. The pie costs $45 and typically serves two, sliced into half-moons. It is plated with a reduction sauce, as classical and French as it gets but with an insistent vein of acidity that somehow makes it modern.\n           \n\n            Even if you\u2019re used to the signature Momofuku move of white-knuckle bungee jumping from the high end to the low, certain juxtapositions may call for Dramamine. Alongside the masterly pork pie, you can find a $5 sandwich of pickled daikon and cucumber sticks inside a grilled and buttered Martin\u2019s hot dog roll. The pickle sandwich is just the thing to eat with the cold fried chicken that is battered three times, fried four times, brushed with a spicy mirin-yuzu glaze and served nearly at refrigerator temperature. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve used that phrase approvingly in a review before, but then I don\u2019t think a restaurant has served me cold fried chicken as good as this before.\n           \n\n            By flipping through the menu pages you can pinpoint the dates when dishes were first served, and see others that came and went. The idea is for Ko\u2019s executive chef, Sean Gray, to use the bar as a \u201cfield for research and development for our culinary team,\u201d according to the website. Ideas are auditioned or refined before they graduate to Ko, which I gave\n            \n             three stars in a 2015\n             \n\n             review\n            \n            . Most menus, at least the ones that change over time, are works in progress, but few make that explicit the way the one at Ko\u2019s bar does.\n           \n\n            The cynical way to look at this is that bar customers are paying to serve as lab rats. This will not be everyone\u2019s idea of a fun night out. One recent evening, the menu was as meat-heavy as at Ssam Bar in the era when its menus still proclaimed, \u201cWe do not serve vegetarian-friendly items.\u201d Among the more substantial dishes that night was a mixed-meat sausage stuffed into a chicken neck and grilled. One end of the neck was open. The other was still attached to the chicken\u2019s head. It was a sensational sausage, but it did nothing to make Ko\u2019s bar the kind of place that you\u2019d take your new pescatarian friend.\n           \n\n            The bar, run collaboratively by Mr. Gray and Su Wong Ruiz, the general manager, works best for diners who don\u2019t need a multitude of choices to be happy. To the extent that it resembles other places, it\u2019s probably most similar to a wine bar, with its tight menu, its casual drop-in-and-stay-awhile air and its carefully considered list of wines by the glass, which it shares with Ko. Anyone who wants a whole bottle can order one from the full Ko list, a virtual who\u2019s who of cult winemakers in certain specialties such as grower Champagne, chenin blanc from the Loire Valley and Burgundy of all stripes.\n           \n\n            On the notebook page facing the handwritten menu are two more wines that Ambrose Chiang, the beverage director, is pouring by the glass for one day only. Recently I\u2019ve lucked into a precisely shaped C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie from Domaine Jasmin and a Saumur from Romain Guiberteau whose self-assurance I envied. These specials can cost twice as much as the regular by-the-glass pours, which tend to fall between $15 and $25.\n           \n\n            I can\u2019t figure out why the wine-geek crowd doesn\u2019t bring tents and sleeping bags to camp out at Ko\u2019s bar. And I don\u2019t understand why the place is almost never crowded, despite getting a fair amount of press after it opened.\n           \n\n            The experimental nature of the menu can\u2019t be keeping people away; people expect that from\n            \n             Momofuku restaurants\n            \n            . The only dish that I thought wasn\u2019t totally successful was the fried zucchini made in the style of the fried chicken, and I was still glad I tried it.\n           \n\n            The prices are all over the place, but a meal here doesn\u2019t need to be expensive. While you are welcome to spend $100 on a sourdough crepe with 50 grams of white-sturgeon caviar, you can just get the crepe alone for $8. It is excellent: shiny with tangy cave-age butter, speckled with oregano cinders and crunchy from a pass over hot Japanese charcoal. The chicken, meanwhile, is $7 a piece.\n           \n\n            The only reason I can think of for the empty seats is that the place is so hard to sum up. Try this description, then: Imagine an eccentric, highly polished David Chang restaurant that the world hasn\u2019t heard about yet.\n           \n\n\n             Follow\n            \n\n\n              NYT Food on Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              NYT Cooking on Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Facebook\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 296, "rating": "\u2605\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/24/dining/momofuku-ko-bar-review.html", "google_mag": 21.899999618530273}, {"review_text": "\n            Until the new\n            \n             Una Pizza Napoletana\n            \n            came along, I didn\u2019t think it was possible for a restaurant to fight itself to a draw.\n           \n\n            In name at least, this is the fourth incarnation of the pizzeria that Anthony Mangieri founded in 1996 in Point Pleasant Beach, N.J. He has never run more than one Una Pizza Napoletana at a time; each time he moves to a new location, he closes the old one. In the East Village (\n            \n             2004\n            \n            -\n            \n             9\n            \n            ) and San Francisco (\n            \n             2010\n            \n            -\n            \n             17\n            \n            ), he essentially stuck to the routine he had established in New Jersey.\n           \n\n            At the two-month-old location on the Lower East Side, though, he is in business with two chefs, Jeremiah Stone and Fabi\u00e1n von Hauske Valtierra, whose sensibilities are wildly different from his own. Their two other restaurants,\n            \n             Wildair\n            \n            and\n            \n             Contra\n            \n            , are very contemporary and European in outlook. A meal at either one makes it obvious that Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske have carefully studied Copenhagen\u2019s foremost exponents of fermentation and foraging. Nothing about Mr. Mangieri\u2019s rigorously traditional pizza indicates that he could find Copenhagen on a map.\n           \n\n            The three of them do have common traits. They take their cooking extremely seriously, favor simplicity and aren\u2019t interested in easy ways out. So their collaboration \u2014 Mr. Mangieri is the pizza guy, of course, while his new partners handle appetizers, desserts and drinks \u2014 might not be doomed, but it isn\u2019t exactly off to a promising start. The problem isn\u2019t the common one of strengths in one area undermined by bad performance in others. Una Pizza Napoletana is almost all strengths, but they\u2019re at war with one another.\n           \n\n            Mr. Mangieri is a purist\u2019s purist. His dough runs on wild yeast. For each batch, he mixes a lump of starter into Sicilian sea salt, finely ground Italian flour and water. With this he makes a crust that is delicious on its own, a minimum requirement for great pizza.\n           \n\n            He makes pies in only one size, a wheel about 12 inches across. There are five on the menu most nights. None are topped with more than four ingredients, or six if you count oil and salt. On Friday and Saturday nights a sixth, more complicated pizza is offered.\n           \n\n            Requests for substitutions or added toppings are not entertained on any night. There is no point asking Mr. Mangieri to put pepperoni on a margherita or Buffalo chicken and blue cheese on a marinara. You would have better luck persuading the driver of the M5 bus to pop a wheelie on Fifth Avenue.\n           \n\n            The pies are at least as extraordinary as the ones he used to make in the East Village. They may be better. I don\u2019t remember the imported buffalo mozzarella\u2019s giving the pies the flavor of melted cultured butter back then, the way it does now. And did the tomato sauce \u2014 pulp, really \u2014 always have the same natural, sun-ripened sweetness? Especially on the marinara, unobscured by cheese and seasoned only with dried oregano, fresh basil and raw garlic, it\u2019s almost hypnotic.\n           \n\n            The Concetta pie, which has four varieties of tomato treated four separate ways, probably would have been beyond his abilities as a chef in the Jersey Shore days. He makes it only on Fridays, which is too bad, because it\u2019s great.\n           \n\n            The everyday pie called the Filetti, made with buffalo mozzarella and ripe red cherry tomatoes, manages to be surprising while sticking to Mr. Mangieri\u2019s strict principles. It\u2019s a personal creed that achieves transcendence \u2014 his \u201cMy Way,\u201d to put it in New Jersey terms.\n           \n\n            I ate one non-transcendent pie at the new Una Pizza Napoletana, a Bianco, which is topped with buffalo mozzarella, raw garlic and basil. It was excellent the next time I had it, and I immediately knew what had been missing: salt.\n           \n\n            All the pies are $25. That is a lot for pizza. On the other hand, it is only about $2.50 more than what Mr. Mangieri charged when he first came to Manhattan in 2004, once you adjust for inflation. Then again,\n            \n             people said he charged a lot for pizza in 2004\n            \n            .\n           \n\n            Mr. Mangieri and his wood-fueled oven are located at the back of the dining room, enclosed by glass on three sides. No doubt this helps keep the wood fire from wilting the customers like basil leaves, but it\u2019s hard not to see it as a metaphor for the restaurant. Mr. Mangieri\u2019s pizzas leave the glass box, but his sensibility doesn\u2019t. Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske have put their own point of view on everything else, and it\u2019s not the point of view of a pizzeria.\n           \n\n            Everybody knows how to eat in a pizzeria; most of us have been doing it since we were kids. The choices are few and relatively predictable. Even when the pizzas are topped with weird stuff, you basically know what you\u2019re getting. At the new Una Pizza Napoletana, only the pizzas are predictable.\n           \n\n            What are bland chunks of white asparagus under a yellow powder of cured egg yolk and bottarga doing here? Not making new friends, I promise you.\n           \n\n            There\u2019s a fine, tender panna cotta with fresh fruit for dessert. One night the strawberry syrup spooned over it was essentially strawberry vinegar; on another night, its sweet-sour ratio was back in alignment.\n           \n\n            The other desserts I tried \u2014 a bittersweet tiramis\u00f9 with a welcome crackle of caramel hidden in its layers, and some pure-tasting, impossibly smooth, eggless ice creams, including a pistachio flavor that has to be tasted to be believed \u2014 won me over from the beginning.\n           \n\n            None of the other appetizers were as charmless as the white asparagus. A freshly shucked sea scallop seasoned with translucent strips of lemon peel and individual dots of couscous was exceptional. And raw lobster surrounded by chickpeas was wonderfully jittery with an Italian citrus-chile paste. But the chefs serve it in a form \u2014 a chopped mass of unidentifiable goo \u2014 that can\u2019t help but look off-putting. That dish would fit right in at Wildair; here, among the tomatoes and mozzarella, it seems to be trying too hard.\n           \n\n            The same goes for the wine list. As they have done in their other places, Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske focus on natural wines. These wines can be mercurial, and the way the list is written only adds to the confusion. Almost no varietals are named, and you can\u2019t tell much from the Italian regions, which include such major hubs as Irpinia and Solicchiata. When, helplessly, you accept a server\u2019s offer of assistance, you\u2019ll be asked what you intend to eat with your wine.\n           \n\n            Are there any people other than sommeliers who want to talk at length about pairing particular wines with particular pizzas? I\u2019ve never met them and if I do, I\u2019m sending them off to be deprogrammed.\n           \n\n            Discussing the list, tasting a few samples, trying to find something that fits your idea of a good pizza wine (yes, for some reason there are wines on the brief list that don\u2019t taste especially good with any pizza) \u2014 all this slows down the pace, which isn\u2019t especially brisk to begin with. By the end of the night, your meal can last twice as long and cost twice as much as it would at almost any other pizzeria in town.\n           \n\n            Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske aren\u2019t doing bad stuff at Una Pizza Napoletana, but often they\u2019re doing the wrong stuff. They and Mr. Mangieri have taken one of the most accessible styles of restaurant dining and made it complicated and a little intimidating. Una Pizza Napoletana doesn\u2019t need to be predictable. But it could be more intuitive.\n           \n\n\n             Follow\n            \n\n\n              NYT Food on Twitter\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              NYT Cooking on Instagram\n             \n\n\n             ,\n            \n\n\n              Facebook\n             \n\n\n             and\n            \n\n\n              Pinterest\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n\n              Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice\n             \n\n\n             .\n            \n\n", "google_score": 0.0, "id": 297, "rating": "\u2605", "review_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/17/dining/una-pizza-napoletana-review.html", "google_mag": 30.899999618530273}]
